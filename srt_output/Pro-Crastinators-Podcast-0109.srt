00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,560
guy ever, and today we're joined by an illustrious cast of goons and scoundrels. First up, Ben

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
Saint.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:28,000
Excuse me. I'm so sick because my body has been neglected. It's wasted away. What can

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I do about that?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
Only there was a solution. Munchy, where's Tony Hatch?

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
You gotta do this podcast quick because I'm melting. I'm about to be a puddle on the floor

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
in about 10 minutes.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
Dude, I love Olaf from Frozen.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Dude, I love the Wizard of Oz.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
Dude, I love the nuclear throne.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I skew.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
I love water.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Hippocrite is here.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,080
Hello, it's me, the weakest boy at the ball. I can't lift my own body weight. Here I am

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,000
on the floor.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Gravity is too strong for this man. And finally, we've got our special guest, the two-time

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,720
returning champion, FitMC.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,960
Everyone in this podcast is a homo sapien.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,480
I thought you were saying that in a different direction.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
I don't want to think about that anymore.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,080
Well, guys, today, we've done it. As you can tell, we've gathered our... It's time for

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,800
the illustrious second half of our world-famous Minecraft and fitness saga.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,360
You were so gung... You just could not wait to do the back-to-back Minecraft and fitness

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
episode.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,000
That was just your one fucking joy in the entire world. It was ripped from you.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I really was excited about... Ever since we were talking about getting Fit on an episode

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,160
of the PCP to begin with, I was really gung-ho to make the topic of that episode, fitness

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,320
and Minecraft, the two most inextricably linked subjects in the world.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,520
A complex Venn diagram is generated.

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,360
There's a lot of connecting nodes there. It's like a brain with all these synapses connected

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,480
through a complex network.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,040
Nate's got a map of the United States up on his wall right now with two thumbtacks

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,520
in it, one labeled fitness in the other mind, and he's got lots of red strings going in

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,080
between them, but they're just between these two points, so it's not a big web. It's just

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
a line.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,160
Yeah. I mean, that's true, but so many can actually...

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,760
But they're linked. They are fucking linked. You cannot deny.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,960
And they'll sit and he'll stare at the wall for 45 minutes, and then he'll nod to himself

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,200
and put up another string, and then the cycle repeats itself.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,760
He spanned the entire yarn around those two points.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,960
He connects the points, and then he just says back, like eyes wide, what does it mean?

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,320
That's what we're doing to solve today.

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,040
So to get into fitness, it simply must be defined. It simply must be defined. Okay,

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,160
now ironically, so the definition of fitness here, okay, here we go. Fitness, the core

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,120
of physical health, get off your computer and try it. That is the definition of fitness,

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,720
which a lot of thinking memes, emojis going on. What else have we got? There's got to

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,880
be a better one. Okay, fitness, here's another one. Fitness, the most important thing you

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,160
can have, without fitness, you're a fat homosexual who sits around all day watching movies on

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,320
your computer and eating cheez-its to be fit, is to be God, probably.

51
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,920
Urban dictionary is Nate. I think this has been a step.

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,480
I mean, it would not... I'm spoiling the future because I definitely will do this one day,

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,080
and I should just go in and knowing what the topic is, I should add a section of whatever

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,360
I wanted to say on Urban Dictionary the day before. I haven't done it yet, but I should

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
read it, and so I should ask someone to read it, because you can see who it's by at the

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,960
bottom. I should leave a little hint by saying that it was by me, and we'll see if anyone

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,600
gets a little hint. By the way, though, I just want to point out, on the list, every

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,640
Urban Dictionary thing has a list of related things. The third one down is FitMC, on the

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,840
Fit Urban Dictionary thing. Let's read what it has to say here. FitMC, a Minecraft YouTuber

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,600
that plays on a popular anarchy server, 2B2T, and in parentheses, also is very fit and muscly.

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
LaMau, FitMC has huge muscles.

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Someone actually wrote that?

63
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,880
This is by anti-socialweeb from July 27th, 2016. That's who wrote this.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,880
It's your biggest fan. I hope he's listening.

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,880
I like the example sentence, like used in a sentence, like a lull.

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah, it's in LaMau. It's in LaMau.

67
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,880
OfficialWeeb, please leave a comment letting us know, telling us your state of mind.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Right. How are you doing?

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,880
This episode comes on the heels of Ufit accomplishing a New Year's resolution, I believe.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Oh, yeah. My New Year's resolution this year, and I said it on Twitter on January 1st, I'm

71
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,880
like, I am going to finally do the one-armed pull-up. And yesterday, yesterday, I did it,

72
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
and I was so happy.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
That's incredible.

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Perfect timing for this podcast.

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I just want to clarify, because some people, I've heard it in various circles, they consider

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
a one-armed pull-up that you have one hand wrapped around the bar, and you can grab your

77
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
other wrist and do a thing like that. Is that what we're talking about?

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
We're talking about just dangling from one arm.

79
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
They call it one-and-a-half sometimes.

80
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
It's just from one arm.

81
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I just want to say, that is fantastic. Congratulations, of course.

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,880
I have long had a dream. Ever since I beat Final Fantasy 7 as a young child, and in the

83
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,880
final cutscene, I have a lot of fitness goals based on the Final Fantasy games.

84
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,880
But at the end of Final Fantasy 7, Cloud canonically does a one-armed pull-up while holding Tifa.

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,880
So that's maybe 160, 180 pounds. I mean, she's got big tits, so you know.

86
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Maybe 80 pounds, maybe 40 pounds each.

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Realistically, she's maybe 120 pounds to 140 pounds. That's probably about right.

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,880
That's about depending on your height.

89
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
I don't know.

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Let's fucking debate how much Tifa weighs.

91
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,880
If you're talking about Final Fantasy fitness goals, though, mine is to suplex a freight train.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,880
That is my Final Fantasy-related goal.

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
That's my next resolution, maybe.

94
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,880
I'll just name my other two. One is that Zell did 100 pull-ups before hitting level 1 at the beginning of Final Fantasy 8.

95
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,880
That was before he even joys the party, which I want to do.

96
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,880
And then just to run up as many flights of stairs in a building as Cloud did in Sheen Rage Q at the beginning of Final Fantasy 7.

97
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,880
With the equivalent of doing 100 pull-ups before reaching level 1 being like doing 100 pull-ups and then like doing episode of the PCP Nate?

98
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Yeah, yeah. That'd be great. I could do that.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,880
And you know what? I've looked into it. Doing 100 pull-ups is not like an insane goal to have.

100
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,880
When I was young, my record was 50. My record was 50 when I was in high school.

101
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,880
I feel like I could do a one-handed pull-up, but mostly because most of, like, the rest of my body has no mass to it.

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Because you're like a swabloo, you know? There's just cotton balls and fuzz.

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Pull-ups are fucking easy, but as soon as I actually get fit, they will be impossible.

104
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Hippo is a drift loon.

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,880
As I'm sure you can tell, viewers, there are two fitness gods here and then laymen of varying degrees of disgust.

106
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:50,880
I would say either, I'm just gonna go on a limb here, either me or Hippo are probably the weakest, the weakest link in society here.

107
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,880
What are you talking about, Monchi? You are an absolute unit.

108
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Okay, we can debate my unitness all day.

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,880
But the fact is, is that I don't look like it, but I'm weak as shit.

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,880
You would be forgiven for thinking that I'm some sort of weird, strong fat person, but no.

111
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,880
It's not like that, really.

112
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:24,880
There was this one moment during Radcon 3 where me and Monchi were running to a train and we were sprinting our fucking lungs out.

113
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Oh god, that was the worst moment.

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,880
I was dragging my suitcase behind me, but I still ran faster than Monchi, so I think I win.

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Okay, well hey, land speed is different from generated force in a punch or a push or whatever you know.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Actually, you reminded me of that, has confirmed, actually, I'm the strongest person to ever exist.

117
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Because I was carrying six grocery bags on each arm, just like pulling them out, running as fast as I could.

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Granted, I was huffing and puffing, and I almost passed out on the train, but I did it.

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I did it, and the job got done.

120
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
There you go. That's some real shit.

121
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Cardiovascular fitness is kind of the area that I want to grow in.

122
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I mean, I don't know.

123
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,880
They say that the group of people in the world who has the highest degree of body dysmorphia is like men, like fit men.

124
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
That's what they say, because they're very self-conscious about wanting to be bigger and whatnot.

125
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,880
If you just go and fit on 4chan, you can prove that.

126
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Yeah, I mean, they'll tell you that you're...

127
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I love the images of the gigantic six foot one guide, and then the six foot zero midget freak standing next to him.

128
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Those are my favorite. Those are my favorite.

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
But I mean, it's a real thing. It's a real thing.

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,880
It's always seemed to me that I've been very self-conscious of how I look.

131
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,880
And that's been a big motivator in why I wanted to work out and look better.

132
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I mean, just recently, Michelle put out a video when we were at an aquarium that I was in, and I'm like, oh, I look fat and gross.

133
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,880
And I know mathematically speaking, objectively speaking, that I look pretty decent, but it's just not good enough.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
And it consumes me. It consumes me.

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,880
It's time to air my dirty laundry.

136
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Time to tell you all. All right, seeing myself specifically in all the videos from Radcon 3,

137
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,880
but especially in the Tails Gets Trolled lecture and comparing them to the Sonichi lecture, I was like, oh my god.

138
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,880
I'd gained maybe like 15 pounds since then, but looking at it and seeing it, I was like, oh my god.

139
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
It puts into perspective.

140
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh, no.

141
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Yeah, no. It was a wake-up call, so I've started getting back into lifting.

142
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I had let it lie pretty fallow for a long time.

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Yeah, I did that one.

144
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
That is great.

145
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm making it a priority again.

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,880
That's why it's really important. A lot of people can just, I think the reason why people get like ridiculously morbidly obese, like in America,

147
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,880
is because they just like day to day is just not part of their lifestyle to like think about that stuff,

148
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,880
because we train human beings totally wrong in this country.

149
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,880
They should be way more conscious of fitness and how to eat healthy and survive and stuff.

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I think me and Hippo are going to have a point to do about fitness and school and sports and shit later, so we'll come back.

151
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah, we can talk about that for sure, because they do it all fucking wrong.

152
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I learned everything I know about fitness from like YouTubers and nothing from school.

153
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I learned it all when I was in like late college.

154
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I think you learned it all from Final Fantasy, Nate.

155
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Well, that too.

156
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,880
When I was in college, I got really into like reading up about fitness and stuff.

157
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I went on Fit a lot. I downloaded a lot of e-books and shit.

158
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I was into it for a little bit, not like crazy, but I was like kind of fit.

159
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,880
I had like a pretty respectable deadlift for a little bit.

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Yeah, your squats were always, I mean, you would see the squat like, your squats were like good?

161
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Mine have always been utterly disgraceful and I don't know why.

162
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I've been able to squat more than you, even when like I hadn't lifted for a while.

163
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't even want to get into my numbers. That would just be embarrassing.

164
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
My numbers, you can't know.

165
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,880
I used to deadlift like 300 something and it was pretty sick, but now I haven't deadlifted in a while, so I don't know.

166
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I felt like a cool guy sometimes.

167
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Just FYI of your, a 315 deadlift is fucking disgraceful.

168
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Like you should be deadlifting four plates, five plates, at least.

169
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
That's not a joke.

170
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Wait, what are you deadlifting?

171
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm deadlifting around three plates, like around 315 right now, which is disgraceful and it's pathetic and nothing.

172
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Ben, what would you say your goal is?

173
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Well, my goal right now is just to like get back into a routine of doing it.

174
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Get back up to what I used to be doing at my best, which was squatting maybe like 250, it's like 245,

175
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
deadlifting like 300 something.

176
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
My bench was always pretty disgraceful.

177
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
My best bench ever was maybe like 165 or so.

178
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I never managed to bench my body weight.

179
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Oh yeah?

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Yeah.

181
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Maybe that should be my goal.

182
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Maybe my goal, getting back into it, is like I'm finally going to bench my body weight.

183
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
That's a good goal and that's attainable for sure.

184
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah.

185
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Do we have a fitness goal?

186
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Well, now that I did the one-armed pull-up, I'm going to try to do it for reps and then also my other arm,

187
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,880
I can barely get my chin to the bar so I'm a little unbalanced.

188
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,880
But just in general, like just working on my body weight fitness because when I was like in my early 20s,

189
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
I was just a lifter.

190
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I wanted to just look like a balloon animal, just hit the weights hard, squats and oats for big gains.

191
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Go mad every day.

192
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Yeah, I know, right?

193
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,880
In my later 20s and living so close to the ocean now and I do a lot of stuff in the water,

194
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,880
I kind of appreciate being at a lower weight because I feel like I can do more athletically like climbing, swimming, surfing.

195
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,880
It's hard to do that stuff when you are a higher body weight just because of all the lifting.

196
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

197
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Well, that's cool.

198
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,880
I mean, I've kind of, I don't know, I want to be Z's, you know, there's no bones about it.

199
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I want to look like Z's.

200
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
That's who I, that would be the ideal.

201
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
You want to be dead?

202
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,880
If you can do what Z's did and not die.

203
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,880
He died overdosing or something in like some brothel or something like fucking the Philippines or something.

204
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Wait, really?

205
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Yeah, he really did, he really did.

206
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I don't know if he overdosed but something was up with his heart, he had like a heart issue.

207
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Yeah, he had like a heart condition.

208
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
It might have just been that.

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,880
But it was like he did take like, you know, substance.

210
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm sure the steroids didn't help his heart.

211
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Yeah.

212
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I thought he was natty.

213
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I thought he was natty.

214
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Oh, no, no, no, he was not.

215
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Here's the thing about Z's.

216
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,880
His body, because he was so cut and so low in body weight, his physique is attainable natty,

217
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
but not in the speed he was able to do it in.

218
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Right, right, right, right.

219
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,880
For those who don't know, by the way, Z's is kind of the god of the fitness board of 4chan.

220
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
He's an Australian cunt and he lived fast and died hard.

221
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,880
But he, you know, have you, Fit, have you watched Scooby 1961 much?

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
He's my fitness icon on YouTube.

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I remember when I first started browsing the Fit board on 4chan, I'd watch some of his videos.

224
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Yeah.

225
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,880
And he had some really informative stuff, like there was some form corrections I was able to make by watching his videos.

226
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Yeah, I thought he was a really good fitness YouTuber to watch, really underrated.

227
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Scooby's a goofy. Scooby's a weirdo.

228
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,880
He's super goofy and he's super gay, but, you know, all is forgiven.

229
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, forgive him.

230
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
We'll give him a royal pardon for being gay.

231
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

232
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I was just going to say on the subject of Z's, he's made a video about how Z's is a better role model than Jeff's side.

233
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Jeff's side's another, like, world-famous, like, fitness guy.

234
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Because Jeff's side claims to be nady, and he may well be, but it's just that if he really is nady, his physique is unbelievable.

235
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
What is nady?

236
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Yeah.

237
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Oh, oh, no, no.

238
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
No steroids.

239
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
We should define our terms.

240
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
No steroids.

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Yeah, no steroids whatsoever, just naturally obtaining, like, a good physique or whatever.

242
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Big naturally slim, naturally muscular, any of that stuff.

243
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
So, yeah, no, no steroids.

244
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm afraid I'm not Natty. My physique is not Natty because I've drank all this caffeine.

245
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I've drank all this caffeine to give myself the jitters to burn off those extra calories.

246
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Well, hey, I'll give you a pass because Scooby definitely consumes a lot of caffeine and calls himself Natty.

247
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Does he?

248
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Yeah, he loves caffeine.

249
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I mean, I was just joking, but I'm surprised. He seems like the kind of guy who'd be like no caffeine,

250
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,880
no fucking, I don't know, polysorbinates or whatever.

251
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,880
You know, Scooby is very much a pragmatist and Scooby recognizes that like, okay, what does caffeine do to your body?

252
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Like, it helps you get energy to do stuff. It has, you know, little to no side effects as long as you don't like take crazy amounts of it.

253
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,880
And I mean, that's really it. And so he's like, yeah, I mean, this seems fine. It doesn't seem harmful.

254
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Because Scooby, what's great about Scooby and everyone, if you're interested in fitness, I would highly recommend you check out Scooby 1961 on YouTube.

255
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
He is, he is the goat as far as I'm concerned for learning this shit.

256
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
He's conscious of tooth. He's got like two goals.

257
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,880
One, to be super muscly and ripped because he just loves looking that way and God bless him for it.

258
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,880
And then a second goal, probably even more important is to just like be super cardiovascularly fit.

259
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Like he loves doing, he does like half Ironmans. He does like bikes across China and like huge crazy trips and stuff.

260
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Despite having like this huge busly physique and he's a huge guy.

261
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,880
So he's just he's just working towards like these are his goals and he devises strategies to help him achieve those things.

262
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,880
You know, and if you have different goals, well, you got to use some different strategies probably.

263
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,880
But and he's developed all these tools on his website, Scooby's Workshop.com that you can use to like help you with whatever your goals are.

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
And it's fucking great. It's fucking great.

265
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Let me let me talk about let me talk about goals. Let me talk about like like aesthetic goals.

266
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I when I got into fitness when I was maybe like 20, around 20 or so, I, you know, I was like, man, I'm real ugly and I need to be less ugly.

267
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,880
And this is my only chance. So yeah, sure, sure it does.

268
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,880
But I think I don't say I don't actually think that matters anymore.

269
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Like I really don't think that it makes much difference what you look like.

270
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
I'll tell you. I'll tell you what does make a difference, Ben.

271
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
I've said this a lot of times before, you know this to be true. It's the beard, dude. It's the fucking beard.

272
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Okay. Yeah. Well, that's a whole separate issue.

273
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Yeah. For me, your beard is iconic. It's fucking iconic.

274
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,880
The thing that everyone thinks about in their mind is the T-Bap Q&A Ben. That's the real thing.

275
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I think most people probably think of the Chris Chan lecture, Ben, but I do think the beard, statistically, I do think the beard is a better look.

276
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
It's coming back.

277
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:28,880
You look like a fucking lumber. You, okay, both you and Nate, this is like a proven fact that everyone like knows you and Ben are appear in the T-Bap Q&A as the most beautiful people

278
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,880
to ever exist. Everyone in the community was like blown away at how you appeared in that video.

279
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
And we just look like normal people doing pony videos, you know.

280
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,880
You're so blown away because you were just normal.

281
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I mean, yeah. That's what I thought at the time.

282
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
I had a real good-looking beard and I was wearing a very flattering outfit.

283
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Yeah. You look like a lumberjack. You look like a lumberjack.

284
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
That was my shirt. I lent it my shirt for that.

285
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
No, no, that was my shirt. I got that in Poland.

286
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Okay, maybe you're right. That's my favorite shirt.

287
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,880
It's like, you know, it's his shirt, but you took it from home.

288
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
No, no, that's all mine. That was all me.

289
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Ben, you are wrong. That is my shirt that I lent. I'm looking at it right now. That was definitely-

290
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Hang on.

291
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Wait, I think, here, I've got it right here. I'm gonna link you.

292
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
This is the mystery that needs solving.

293
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
This must be solved.

294
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I completely believe Nate Biasbett has a history of stealing Nate's clothes.

295
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
I did not steal those shoes.

296
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Nate left them behind and I went home and I saw the shoes and I said,

297
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
are these Nate's? And mom said, Nate left them and said he didn't want them.

298
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
And I was like, well, they're cool, so I'll take-

299
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Look, mom was misinformed, all right?

300
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Yeah, misinformed.

301
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
And that's not my-

302
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
No, I'm looking. That's my shirt. That is my favorite shirt. I bought it in Poland.

303
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
I remember.

304
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Okay, all right.

305
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Maybe you're right.

306
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
It's not just his favorite shirt. It's not just his shirt yet.

307
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah, that's my-

308
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
It's his favorite-

309
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I remember buying it and it was my favorite shirt ever since.

310
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Okay, you might be right.

311
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I'll kill you for this.

312
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Link in the description to give me back my shirt from Ben.

313
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I started starving Indiegogo for that.

314
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Michael, I've always had-

315
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Yeah, tell us about it.

316
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Like a dream, but not a dream since it's something I want to actively work towards,

317
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
like, you know, drawing and stuff like that.

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
But it's one of those, like, side, like, nightmares that I have in my life

319
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
that just I hope I stumble into somehow,

320
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
but they're not my primary, like, motivating goal in life,

321
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
and just hopefully along the road to accomplishing my actual goals,

322
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I will somehow become it.

323
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
I want to be a bear.

324
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
A big gay bear?

325
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Yeah, a big gay bear, unironically.

326
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Next.

327
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
That is my goal.

328
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I want to be-

329
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You're honestly most of the way there already.

330
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I know, dude.

331
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
That's- that's-

332
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Imagine, Matt.

333
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Imagine me being like a daddy bar.

334
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Like, it's so easy.

335
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I basically am already doing it.

336
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I already do that all the time.

337
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,880
You should be downloadable DLC for Dream Daddy.

338
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
You should-

339
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
What is that?

340
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
What is that?

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
It's actually true.

342
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
You can go after if you're looking out.

343
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Let me know.

344
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
All you need to do much.

345
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
You probably don't need to change a thing about your life.

346
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
You just need to start powerlifting.

347
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah.

348
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
And probably just eat more food.

349
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Probably eat more food.

351
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Okay, here's the thing.

352
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Eat more protein.

353
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,880
The thing about getting fit and getting swole.

354
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Okay, because I'm all about simplicity.

355
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I'm all about cut away needless complexity and just reduce it to most basic principles.

356
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,880
And I think that something that everyone could internalize and would be better off for it

357
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
is this idea that, okay, lifting does everything.

358
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Because lifting-

359
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Yeah, like you said, making no changes in your life.

360
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,880
If you just start lifting or lift more, you can eat all the same shit.

361
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,880
And you will simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle due to the calories being redirected

362
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,880
in your body, due to the new strains you were putting on it.

363
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh, but Ben, after I exercise, I gotta go get myself a little treat.

364
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
I gotta go get myself a little treat every time I lift.

365
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Gotta hit up Starbucks and get a couple of treats, if you know what I'm saying.

366
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
I mean-

367
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
That's just how I do it.

368
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Sure, whatever.

369
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
And even if you do that, you'll still be better off if you're lifting.

370
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
I mean, you will be better off.

371
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
That's true.

372
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
My dream is to be a barred dad.

373
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
But I actually do have a real goal.

374
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
And it's not to become a fitness god.

375
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
But all I wanna do is just walk.

376
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,880
I wanna have a time in the day for like an hour where I just walk down my street.

377
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Dude, you know who used to take spirited, portly walks?

378
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Portly walks.

379
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Benjamin Franklin.

380
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Wait, did he call them portly walks?

381
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Was it like his version of Winnie the Pooh's stoutness exercises?

382
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Absolutely.

383
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Absolutely.

384
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
That's exactly what it was.

385
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Wait, wait, wait.

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
With Benjamin Franklin.

387
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
More like goutness exercises.

388
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Oh, he couldn't walk at all.

389
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Too soon.

390
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Too soon.

391
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Get on the ground, county father.

392
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Get on the ground, county father.

393
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Yeah, I just wanna take more walks and I wanna be able to like go outside more.

394
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Because honestly, I think that's the most alluring thing about being fit.

395
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,880
It's just feeling like you're not dying constantly.

396
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Pokemon go, dude.

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Pokemon go.

398
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I feel like I'm dying like maybe 32% of my life.

399
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Oh.

400
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I feel like I'm dying.

401
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Wait.

402
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
That's not bad.

403
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
You feel like you're dying?

404
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Yeah.

405
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
That much?

406
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
What do you, like, cause you feel really bad physically?

407
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Is that the idea?

408
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Yeah.

409
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Okay.

410
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
All right, Monchi, I have the perfect remedy for you.

411
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,880
I will teach you the secret to becoming fit.

412
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Are you ready?

413
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Oh, shit.

414
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Is it law of attraction?

415
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
I guarantee you it's law of attraction.

416
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Law of attraction.

417
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Is it punching trees with your hands?

418
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Close.

419
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Is it sitting under a waterfall?

420
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
No, let him sit.

421
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,880
No, I don't even give a shit what the real answer is.

422
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Oh, man.

423
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,880
So, first off, you need to master the exercise that is a fit favorite.

424
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
It's called the fork put down.

425
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,880
And if you're able to do these for at least 15 repetitions for three sets, you're good.

426
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Second of all, start an Instagram account for yourself.

427
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,880
And post your progress every single day.

428
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Damn.

429
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,880
So that way, if you fail, it will live on forever in a government database long after you die.

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,880
So that is the ultimate motivation to keep going.

431
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Third.

432
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
It is public ridicule.

433
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Yeah.

434
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Absolutely.

435
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Absolutely.

436
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Oh, God.

437
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Well, third is just eat steroids.

438
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Lots of them.

439
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
And you will make it.

440
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Slurp them up.

441
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Yep.

442
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
And that's it.

443
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
You know, I was going to have my daily Captain Crunch.

444
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,880
You know, I'm just going to pour some steroids on there for good measure.

445
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Yeah, but for real though, having people around to hold you accountable is like one of the best things you can have.

446
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Like exercise groups.

447
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Like with most things.

448
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Yeah.

449
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Yes.

450
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Totally true.

451
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,880
Because it's so easy to just like, even me.

452
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Like I missed like two workouts this week, but I was like sick.

453
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,880
But like the week before, I like missed a day of exercising on like Monday or something.

454
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
And it was like, it's like, well, you know, like nobody's around.

455
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm just going to, I can just go home and it won't be a problem.

456
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
It'll be fine.

457
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
It'll be fine.

458
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
And you know, like if someone was there being like, time to go.

459
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
All right, Nate.

460
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Come on.

461
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Let's let's fucking get to the gym.

462
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I'd be like, all right, here we go.

463
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
And that would be a totally different atmosphere.

464
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
And I would like definitely go because like the worst thing for me about like the thing

465
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,880
that prevents me from like actually getting to the gym on days is that like when I'm at

466
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,880
work and I've, and I've dicked around too much during the day, but I have to stay late

467
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
to like catch up on the shit I've done.

468
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,880
And then I ended up getting late and I'm like, shit, I got to get home and get to work.

469
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
So I guess I'll skip the gym today.

470
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,880
So the solution to me to make sure I never miss a day at the gym is to literally just

471
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,880
have my life together and stick to my schedule so that I actually like fulfill all my commitments

472
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,880
so I can get there and not fuck everything up.

473
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
So I mean, it's just kind of like a total life change thing for me.

474
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I don't want to like intimidate, intimidate people away from that thing and like, oh,

475
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
my whole life needs to change.

476
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm just saying that like for me, that's, that's kind of my biggest hurdle.

477
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Like I know what I'm doing now.

478
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
I just got to actually fucking get there to do it.

479
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I don't have.

480
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh, you got something to say.

481
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
You can see it.

482
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,880
Well, I was going to say, I know for a lot of people, like if you've never done fitness

483
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,880
before, you've never like gone to the gym, it can seem like it's intimidating.

484
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,880
What's cool about fitness is that there's tons of things you can do and not be in a

485
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,880
gym, like even just in your bedroom doing pushups, you know, planks, things like that.

486
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Just to build up basic strength if you're feeling a little too insecure to go into the

487
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
gym.

488
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
You know, like there's still a lot of basic things you can do without ever stepping foot

489
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
in the gym.

490
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
So yeah.

491
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
And I know a lot of people.

492
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh yeah, go on.

493
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Something that has always been the problem with me, not just in terms of fitness, but

494
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
with everything.

495
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Is this idea that like if it's not just so, then like fuck it.

496
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,880
So like if I'm on like a routine, like if I'm on like a three day a week, like lifting

497
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,880
routine and I get it and a day comes and like I can't get to the gym.

498
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm not like, oh, well, I'll do pushups or cardio or something instead.

499
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
I'm just like, I can't do the thing.

500
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Then fuck it.

501
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
It's ruined.

502
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Throw it all in the garbage.

503
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
That could be a big problem.

504
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah.

505
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Yeah.

506
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,880
And like the solution is either get over that or just like make absolutely sure that your

507
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,880
schedule never fucks up so that you don't have this adverse reaction due to your psychological

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
problems.

509
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,680
I've never had very much success regimenting like exercise for myself because of like one,

510
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
I don't eat that much anyway.

511
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
So I don't have like a weight loss problem.

512
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,880
I'm an average weight and it's all fine.

513
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,880
And also I don't really particularly care about getting swole.

514
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,880
So like the only reason I would do exercises because well, it's better than not doing exercise.

515
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,880
But it's always like, I tried it like a couple months, I tried getting up and having like

516
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,880
a doing some cardio or something before breakfast.

517
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,880
And it works a bit, but I keep falling out of favor with it.

518
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,880
And I feel like if I was, if I'm ever going to do like a real fitness thing, it would just

519
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,880
be because I am like doing something else that I also want to do, like learning to play

520
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
the drums properly.

521
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Like playing the drums is like that's a pretty good thing to do.

522
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
So I feel like I'm not a fitness boy.

523
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I feel like I'm a health boy.

524
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm not a fitness boy.

525
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I feel like there's a difference between the two.

526
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Well, you know, that's fine.

527
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,880
But like what about, what about a goal like, and I don't know if you care about this, but

528
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,880
like I personally, I would like to, before I die, run a marathon.

529
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
That's a goal of mine.

530
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
That's a goal.

531
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
And you know, I know people who've gone from couch to marathon in six months, so it shouldn't

532
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,880
really take me that fucking long, but it's not a, it's not a huge priority for me right

533
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
now.

534
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,880
But what about like cardiovascular strength, like being able to run for a long time?

535
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Like that's something that doesn't taste like super muscle.

536
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I've always been pretty good at running.

537
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,880
My favorite thing, like my favorite physical thing to do is just climbing on rocks.

538
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
I don't, I don't particularly like, like.

539
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Do they call that bouldering in England?

540
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
They call that in America too.

541
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,880
When I worked at AstroCamp, I knew a bunch of guys that really liked bouldering.

542
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,880
And in fact, I have with me right now a t-shirt from Boulder Fest, 2000, I don't know, 13

543
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
or whatever.

544
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Yeah.

545
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Are you going to BoulderCon this year?

546
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Yeah.

547
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,880
It's just, we all went up to like a local mountain and just like clambered around on some

548
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
low rocks.

549
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Yeah.

550
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
And they made t-shirts for it.

551
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
And it was Boulder Fest.

552
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Just a group of about 20 or so guys just walking up to a cliff and you just know floundering

553
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,880
and just, you know, trying to climb up some rocks.

554
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Like one guy just like puts his feet on a rock face and kind of like kind of kind of

555
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,880
crab walks to the left across it for a ways.

556
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,880
And you know, if he gets a little high, people hold a mattress under him.

557
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
There's a couple of guys with some rocks.

558
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
What could be better?

559
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
And that's bouldering.

560
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Yeah.

561
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,880
I don't know whether I'd like go and with a group of people and do something like that.

562
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,880
But like, I enjoy climbing and getting up high.

563
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,880
So like climbing stairs, climbing up to the top of a big old rock, just being on a cliff,

564
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,880
not jumping off though.

565
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,880
These things, like climbing a tree, I would climb a tree just because.

566
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
But I wouldn't like regiment it.

567
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I don't think I'm built for that sort of weirdness.

568
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Just like a gibbon.

569
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
It's so weird.

570
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Like a monkey gibbon, you know?

571
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
That's what they do.

572
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
They climb trees and they swing around.

573
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
That's it.

574
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
That's it.

575
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
That's all they do.

576
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Pokemon Go, unironically, has been such an improvement on my life.

577
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,880
When I was in Boston, I've easily like walked like probably more than I ever have my entire

578
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,880
life just to get fucking Rayquaza.

579
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
That's all that I cared about during my time.

580
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Dude, I fucking.

581
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I had to get as many Rayquaza as humanly possible.

582
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
So I walked all fucking over town.

583
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,880
I walked from fucking Faniel Hall down to like the fucking Prudential Center, like over

584
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
and over again.

585
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
One time I did it like three times in one fucking day.

586
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Damn.

587
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Back and forth just fucking constantly.

588
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Damn those fucking Pokemon.

589
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Yeah.

590
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
It was great.

591
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
When Pokemon Go first started and I was really into it, I was the same.

592
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
I was like, oh, this is going to be great.

593
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,880
I really want to get out of the house and walk every day.

594
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
So I did for like months and it was great and I was catching Pokemon.

595
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,880
But then as Pokemon Go stopped being interesting to me for like, it was like, it got really

596
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,880
cold and I just didn't want to go out and it was bad.

597
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,880
I know actually I did go out quite a lot during the winter.

598
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,880
But like, it was just, it just lost, it fell out of favor with me.

599
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,880
And I also stopped wanting to go outside and I was like, damn, I really hoped that Pokemon

600
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Go would just make me be like normal, like going outside and walking and being normal.

601
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
I need Pokemons like you take care of my body.

602
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
I need them.

603
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Yeah.

604
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,880
I didn't want to rely on Pokemon Go because eventually it will stop being fun and then

605
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I will start walking and it sucks.

606
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Well, eventually the universe will burn out.

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,880
That I joined Pokemon Go when I did, well, rejoined it rather, is because I joined when

608
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Raids were already an established thing and Raids are just fantastic.

609
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
They are just fucking beautiful.

610
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,880
For those of you who don't know, Raids are when a Pokemon will spawn at a gym and so

611
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,880
you have to take it down together as a group and you have to assemble a team, some sort

612
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
of dead squad if you will, to take down the various Pokemon that arise.

613
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,880
And so I'll just be walking, I'll walk like fucking like 10 kilometers one day trying

614
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,880
to find Rekweza eggs and then I'll come across some colorful characters if you will.

615
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,880
In Boston, I just found the craziest fucking people you will ever find playing Pokemon

616
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,880
not just like nerds, but like fathers and mothers and children and weird disabled people.

617
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,880
I've already told the story about the guy who said that everyone Pokemon loves the cock

618
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,880
and couldn't stop saying the phrase, yeah, this Pokemon loves the cock.

619
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
He just loves it.

620
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
It was this portly fat guy.

621
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
That guy, I found people like that all the time.

622
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
It was beautiful.

623
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I love meeting urban freaks and Pokemon Go don't allow me to take care of my body, but also

624
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,880
allows me to see freaks and those are my two favorite pastimes is being alive and seeing

625
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
freaks.

626
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I mean getting the exercise thing is definitely good because my fucking life is like in front

627
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,880
of a computer and then I go to the gym and like work out for a time and you know do some

628
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
time on the treadmill.

629
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Then I come home and get back in the computer and like I don't feel like it's really

630
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,880
that good of a lifestyle like I should probably do way more cardio or spend like any time

631
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
outside.

632
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,600
So something like Pokemon Go is just that brings me to walk for like five minutes outside is

633
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,880
honestly a huge change of pace from what I like normally do in a day and just that in

634
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,040
itself I think is really good just to get some fucking sun because I'm the palest motherfucker

635
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,880
at the gym by far and also just to like explore my environment a little bit.

636
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,600
You know that's always nice just to I feel so I feel like such an internet denizen such

637
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,880
a citizen of the internet and like I have very little grounding in my physical environment

638
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,880
if you know what I mean and it's nice to it's nice to have a reason to fucking check that

639
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
shit out every once in a while.

640
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,960
I before Pokemon Go and when I got back home I started playing a lot but before that I

641
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,840
didn't really like know my area excruciatingly well like I didn't really like know downtown

642
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,760
San Diego that well but after like playing Pokemon Go for the past couple of weekends

643
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,520
like I've been doing I feel like I feel like local in the place that I live I feel like

644
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I know my way around the city and it's just like culturally enriching I would call it

645
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,080

666
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,960

667
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,400
I've achieved through my incredible MLG Gamer skills my finger dexterity is through the

668
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,120
fucking roof those those fucking kingdom hearts final mix bosses they have definitely by the

669

T Rex looks dope as fuck it's looking excellent this looks quite goofy it's just great it

670
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:19,040
looks pretty funny he looks very fuck teeth okay let's seriously talk about if video games

671
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,240
have had any positive impact or coordination don't claim to be a musician unless you play

672
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,360
video games I mean I was gonna say that I feel like playing guitar does it better but

673
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,040
I also play a lot of video games so who knows which one influenced the other John Lydden

674
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,480
fucking Jimmy Hendricks get the fuck out of here I'm playing I mean if we're talking

675
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,640
about fitness and gaming I can't believe we haven't mentioned the all-time great for fitness

676
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,440
and video games DDR I was yeah DDR man there it is there it is didn't it used to like track

677
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,520
your calories burned or something yeah it was like a workout mode yeah I used to do that

678
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,280
Nate remember remember remember the good old days playing pretty damn good at DDR pretty

679
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,360
good DDR Max 2 DR Max 2 there were a couple of there were a couple of songs I'm trying

680
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:20,720
to remember a couple of a breakdown yeah and that's why I'm aesthetic of DDR and I

681
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,760
always want to fly those people that can just fucking go ham to my knowledge though I still

682
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,720
could a video game that you wouldn't think maximizes fitness and turns you into a health

683
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:38,800
God but I've learned does is VR chat I've been recently what listening to a lot of radio

684
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:45,640
pros that gets host by young Rikowski actor of Parker do 91 and one of the hosts he has

685
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:53,200
his name is Dewey and Dewey is this guy who goes on VR chat every night and gets so wasted

686
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,760
dancing and raving in the virtual weeks and like communicate with like serial killers that

687
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,240
sometimes he'll just like he'll like like pass out with the VR on after drinking so much then

688
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,560
just wake up and continue like raving all fucking wow this is like lost like five pounds just

689
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,360
just straight up raving in VR that's just all you fucking guys I mean with like dare reason like

690
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,120
in that sock members I mean the cool thing about VR is it does make you move your physical body

691
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:33,360
which is cool yeah yeah you've got an Oculus Rift I do I do and it is so close getting me one

692
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,240
two you were so close I was a couple a couple hundred a couple hundred more more dollars a

693
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,880
couple hundred more dollars and we could yeah yeah next time that would have been ready to be our

694
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:54,360
dude incredible Matt dude imagine imagine playing endless war in VR next base hey can you can you

695
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:00,120
play Minecraft in VR could you use the slime mod well I mean then fucking Lord of Ghosts

696
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:10,480
dude dude Lord of Ghosts slime in VR holy shit yes please I played with the texture pack you made

697
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:18,960
and but no not you made that one of the characters Lord of Ghosts is made not anyone here and it's

698
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,080
beautiful it's simply beautiful so wherever you are Lord of Ghosts thank you for the present and

699
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,560
incidentally we brought it back around to Minecraft I told you they were intricately like

700
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,240
this is one of the many connecting nodes that I've mapped out on my fucking red string chart

701
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:39,520
yes excellent let's talk about how school has ruined fitness forever and it's made great

702
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,560
think that running is evil yes I had I had a tweet a couple days ago because I just had this

703
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:53,360
thought about like how I'm sure a lot of people got turned off from taking care of their body

704
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,360
fitness ways because the only way you could do fitness at school is competitive sport and if

705
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:07,640
you're not on the winning team you feel like shit and so there's a lot of sports with with

706
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,520
fitness means that people who don't like playing tennis or football yeah end up not trying to

707
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,640
exercise it's also just the simple fact that it is a game like like sports are a game that you play

708
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,600
with like objectives outside of the fact of fitness being fit helps you play sports like you don't

709
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,520
play sports to get fit really yeah like don't get me wrong I understand I think the idea behind it

710
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,360
they're like ah we'll make it a game it will be fun because it's fun we'll basically be tricking

711
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,320
these kids into like being healthy and shit like that's like the logic behind it that's why like

712
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,520
we play like dodgeball and shit we're you know fucking young wherever you know that that's fucking

713
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,240
banned now or whatever but like yeah like in like we had health class and we had like Jim and these

714
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,280
were like totally separate Jim was just play some semi-fit games or like run around the track like

715
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,520
once or twice and it was like it was embarrassed it was like terrible and I hated it of course

716
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,240
everybody hated it and like health class I just learned that it was like an elective it was shit

717
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:14,120
it was embarrassment it was nothing we need to fucking teach people about fucking like what the

718
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:19,720
fuck is a calorie like how do you okay like fit was saying before about like the doing doing reps

719
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,320
of his favorite exercise the the fork put down the fork put down is a great exercise but I've got

720
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,520
one that I learned from my voice is that a gardening thing no you're shoveling soil around and then

721
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,680
you put down the fork you pick it back up move some more soil I'll get you fit I mean that's

722
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,880
that's true that's true but this is the exercise I'm thinking of it's the it's called the loaf

723
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,200
turnover and this works with it with a large variety of different instruments it's like when

724
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,040
you got a bread loaf before you put that motherfucker in your face you perform the loaf turnover and

725
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,760
you turn it over and you look at the fucking nutrition facts label on the back of the goddamn

726
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,320
thing before you eat it and so many people don't even know that like everything you need to know

727
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,680
for the most part like 99% of what you want to know about a food is just on the label how many

728
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,960
calories are in it like the amount of the grams of sugar that are in it like and and particularly

729
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,960
with the loaf turnover specifically like reading like white bread the thing is when you make bread

730
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,400
you use like only part of the grain to make like white bread that gets removed so that's just like

731
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,800
the pure white fluffy stuff but like what like whole wheat bread has way more like fiber and

732
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,520
actual vitamins and stuff that's actually good for you not just pure carbs so you want to eat

733
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,440
more of that shit and like if you turn over and you look at the ingredients and you see it says

734
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,160
100% whole wheat and it says 100% whole wheat in the ingredients and doesn't you know give

735
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,320
any bullshit then you know ah this is good like this is what I should be putting in my body

736
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,840
though I mean there's another case like bread is just like you should just not eat bread but the

737
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:59,200
one thing about food and calorie counting that I always hate is that I don't I don't care I would

738
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,200
rather like I would rather learn how to cook vegetables to make them tasty and then just eat

739
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,760
that because I know vegetables are just good and you should yeah I mean the simpler it is the

740
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:17,680
simpler the solution is the more people will actually do it that definitely makes sense it's

741
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,040
just like I you know since I've been sort of in this world for a while now like there's two

742
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:28,000
ways to approach it Scooby himself advocates like he advocates for like simple substitutions to make

743
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,560
it as easy as possible because he knows like realistically that's what people who are just

744
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,840
starting will be like willing to do like cut out soda just start drinking water like someone could

745
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,560
conceivably do that and like lose a bunch of weight and feel better about themselves oh but

746
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,640
like I mean you know it's tough but people can do it but like the real ultimate goal for everyone

747
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:54,160
in the world ultimately should be to like gauge their BMI know how many calories they need in a

748
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,280
day have a direct fitness goal count their calories count their macro nutrients and make sure

749
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,200
they're doing all this stuff correctly every day and like formulate their diet so that they're

750
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,960
getting what they need for their goals whatever those may be okay but that's a lot to ask of

751
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,240
people I mean some some goals can be quite vague you want to be like huge you want to be a big

752
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,920
huge boy with more less yeah yeah with big old muskles I don't like I don't particularly care

753
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,640
about having like a large mass I feel like I'd rather be a compact lad like you punch me but I'm

754
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:33,040
made of steel you know you want what you want what Michelle said you all Michelle describes as

755
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,400
lean muscle lean muscle she's always talking about it's like it's just like normal muscle only 10

756
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,880
times as dense and powerful she'll buy these like bullshit products it's so dense every single

757
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:56,600
ligament so many black hole you're so fucking dense I actually read this I read the series called

758
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,760
it's called it's like history's strongest warrior Kenichi or something it's this manga it got made

759
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,120
into an anime yeah like at the beginning of the series it's about a guy who goes from like a normie

760
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,440
he starts doing like fitness specifically to like learn karate to like defend himself from some

761
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,720
bullies or whatever I did escalate to whatever but like at first he's just a normal guy and he

762
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,280
wants to get ripped and like the guys of this dojo he stumbles upon like all huge and muscly but

763
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,760
like the guy who's training him is this like normal looking dude but then and so so he's like

764
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,360
following that guy's training regiment and he's not gaining any muscles like well dude what the

765
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:35,200
fuck I'm not like getting ripped what the hell but later on like turns out like that that that

766
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,600
normal looking guy like his shirt falls off and you can see he's just like super tight and his

767
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,000
muscles are glistening he just looks normal size he's like wait what and then Kenichi like

768
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,320
looks himself he's like wait I my muscles are so dense I've been developing lean muscle and they

769
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,280
describe like a different type of muscle that this guy has been cultivating that doesn't make any

770
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,880
fucking sense like this is like completely made up like slow twitch versus fast twitch muscle or

771
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:05,000
something I don't really think that's a real thing right there's like maybe they describe it as

772
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:13,680
pink muscle muscle confusion some muscle confusion stuff isn't that just some shit to like

773
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,880
develop like more power when you're like I mean I guess it makes sense the whole point was the

774
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:25,160
guys in 300 did they all did like muscle confusion workouts to like huge muscles not yeah well what

775
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:31,040
the fuck is muscle you do it different different exercises all the time so your body never gets

776
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,840
but that's just a way to build a muscle faster I think I think my body disoriented that's how

777
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,440
I mean kind of yeah but fit did you have a comment yeah the easiest way to see the comparison is

778
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:50,760
look at a sprinter versus a marathon runner like Usain Bolt is a sprinter and he is huge and then

779
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,400
if you look at a marathon runner most of their bodies actually look like shit aesthetically

780
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,880
there's a huge difference between muscles that are meant for endurance and then muscles that are

781
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,040
meant for explosiveness if you train your body for explosiveness you're gonna have more size but

782
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,720
if you're training for endurance you're not gonna have as much size and it's not going to be as

783
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,200
aesthetic yeah and when I play Dark Souls I put all my points into endurance so like I want to

784
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,480
roll more but all I'm saying is that this Kenichi guy was training to be a fighter so you want

785
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,840
explosive power he's not trying to be a marathon runner so I'm just saying it doesn't make any fucking

786
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,200
sense oh but I think later I think later he does the other type of muscle he has both he's like

787
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,720
later later on he gets huge this is just like his first regiment where he develops his like first

788
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,760
power base I didn't read it that far but I you know I've kept up every once in a while yep what

789
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,840
one of my side nightmares that I hope I still want to which will help like accommodate me also be

790
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,880
coming a bear is I want to become a world-class chef and have seven restaurants exactly okay

791
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:05,680
extremely obtainable as a side one of my seven Cooper hotels I just want to be able to like cook

792
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:13,440
like real fucking food and like not not have to rely on like like going to like I don't go to fast

793
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,960
food ever really but I don't want to have to become you know rely on like restaurants or anything

794
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,600
I want to be able to like know my real shit be able to like cook actual real like you know like

795
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,440
vegetable fried rice and real shit in the comfort of my own home I think that's extremely desirable

796
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,680
and that would be yeah totally becoming like a health boys but not like relying on I have to

797
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,480
like get shit I can just make shit myself that's definitely a great thing to do I've like I've

798
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,080
wanted to do that I'm honestly just like too lazy to put in the time to do it I've been like I've

799
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,400
been ordering a lot from like Grubhub and stuff and like I generally aim towards healthier meals

800
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,240
you know like getting like grilled chicken instead of like fried and stuff and stuff along those

801
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,000
lines just very simple stuff and I have a lot I take a lot of like protein powder and stuff throughout

802
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,560
the day and yeah cooking is easiest to like get into the habit of knowing your way around a

803
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:11,000
kitchen by doing your own breakfast when you're really sleepy because you're so sleepy you can't

804
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,520
you can't decide you can't think to yourself ah fuck it you're so sleepy you can't even do that

805
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,560
you're just sort of like okay put that there but a crack an egg smash you know you're just sort of

806
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,520
like and then before you know it something goes on a plate and you better eat it and if it's bad

807
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,840
you better do it good next time so you're making a lot of breakfasts quite good that's that's that's

808
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,840
good but what by doing it when you're like sleepy you you just do it and you don't even have the

809
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:45,240
energy to question yourself you just go through the motions okay okay a lot of it too is that if you

810
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,600
have food in your house that is readily available to eat like without preparation you're more likely

811
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:57,080
to eat that so if you keep materials in your fridge that you have to prepare mm-hmm you you're

812
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,920
pretty much guaranteed that you're gonna start cooking a lot more often like many times when I

813
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,200
go shopping I'll get like tons of eggs tons of uncooked meats and stuff like that and when I have

814
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,480
that in the fridge I'm more likely to cook than I am to like you know eat a cookie or something like

815
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,040
that yeah having like a bag of chips around is a dangerous game when you are trying to like get

816
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,040
yourself into cooking more and you know like get yourself focused on like you want to be in an

817
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,880
environment surrounded by the kind of food you want to eat because if that's all that's around

818
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,760
that's all you're gonna eat and as long as you you know it's totally totally great point and I'm

819
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,200
gonna rant a little bit here one thing that is a huge contributor to obesity especially in American

820
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,760
society is that a lot of people don't realize they're drinking their calories because it is if you

821
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,200
look at obesity cases it is almost impossible to get that fat just eating food alone yeah if you're

822
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,280
drinking a lot of those calories okay yeah drinking the calories is a thing that I realized

823
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:04,200
that I like I was totally willing to give up drinking calories because like I don't mind the

824
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,280
taste of like diet drinks so like I know that they've got their own problems and their own

825
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,400
their own health issues associated with them but I never ever drink calories I've switched

826
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,120
entirely to diet soda I think the people who are like I think the people who think diet soda is

827
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,680
gross are idiots and I hate them that's all I have to say about that like why why why would you

828
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,640
drink your calories because they honestly this is not to be me it's just people just don't think

829
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,920
about it they just this is not like in their consciousness to like worry about what they're

830
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,960
consuming people need to be so much more conscious about what they put inside themselves and like I

831
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,560
really think that is the issue for we need from cradle to fucking grave we need a complete revolution

832
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,520
in like I don't know like for if you live in like uh like Greece or or Japan or someone like

833
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,160
Mediterranean or like coastal like oceanic places like those guys don't have obesity problems

834
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,240
because the food that's around is just like the Mediterranean diet is well known to be like one

835
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,840
of the healthiest in the world and then Japan itself they eat a lot of fish they eat a lot of

836
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,520
they eat rice but not that much but they have a lot of like different things to choose from

837
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:12,840
it's just the environment they're in sort of enables them to just like make smart choices because

838
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,720
that's just what's available but in America like what's been made available to us is just

839
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,040
endless calories in every form you can imagine like the fast food stuff we've got

840
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,160
the kind of drinks we have the huge you know mega ultra gulps those are all the problem

841
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,520
because like and they say like well a person just needs to choose and like you know make

842
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:37,080
smart decisions the problem just is that people didn't grow up knowing that they're gonna make

843
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:42,120
these kind of mistakes and and and how to properly take care of their bodies and like it's like a

844
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,400
fucking it's like a fucking adult gauntlet to go through learning how to eat right once you're

845
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,720
like fucking 20 you start figuring that shit out when like you're in danger of your metabolism

846
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,400
starting to slow down and then you start to get fat and shit and a lot of people just never figure

847
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,960
it out and that's led to the world we're in right now it's fucked up and we just need to yeah yeah

848
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,400
go on i'll just say a huge part of it too is socioeconomic a lot of the cheapest foods are some

849
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,000
of the most unhealthy and it's a huge problem a lot of families and poverty and stuff like if

850
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,800
they're only feeding their kids like really cheaply made food and you know that's there's a reason

851
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,680
why child obesity is a problem it's because these kids are being fed by their parents and it's shit

852
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:29,080
food you know what's weird is that a lot of the time i find that like ready meals and easy to

853
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:36,200
you know really cheap shit is not actually as cheap as just buying a thing of rice and some kidney

854
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:42,920
beans or whatever and making like a yeah a curry that's so it's it can feed you for so much more

855
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,000
the problem is but nobody nobody really knows because they're like i don't know i don't know how

856
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,840
to put it together exactly that's exactly that's the money is ignorant on it yep so they just aren't

857
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:58,680
like if you buy like a huge bag of rice that'll you'll just like scoop out of for a month i guarantee

858
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,240
that will be like a million times cheaper than like buying fast food every day or whatever uh

859
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,480
yeah there's no doubt yeah you know there's one thing there's one thing that i've learned and

860
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,920
i don't know i i saw i i kind of take it for granted that uh my parents have so many nice

861
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:19,240
glasses that are made of glass but like i drink water all the time and i'm not really a soda boy

862
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,080
and i think it's because i don't drink out of plastic cups plastic makes water taste like

863
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:31,240
shit if you have like glasses that you drink water out of they actually taste better it tastes juicy

864
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,360
i would encourage people to drink water out of glasses even tap water right so something about

865
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:42,280
the lip touchery is like it makes it nicer to drink and then you will drink more water if you

866
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,400
have nice glasses substituting water for just whatever the fuck people are drinking right now

867
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,520
would just do so much to to help this issue uh yeah that that would be great i drink mostly

868
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,480
water these days and then just water mixed with like protein powder and shit what this goes back

869
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:07,720
to is my famous legendary vlog watery advice keep bringing that up because it's the most influential

870
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:15,640
thing ever created it's inspired a generation uh it's just it's just a brain blast but you filmed

871
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:24,040
it yeah it is exactly it's just a brain blast i had it it's like showering feels really good

872
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,040
and that's and that's how i feel about about like like uh eating well and like working out and stuff

873
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,080
is that like you don't want to do it because like like in the moment while you're doing it it might

874
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:41,960
not like feel like incredible but afterward and even a lot of times during it it will feel great i

875
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:47,320
know whenever i take a walk and you know i do i do good health stuff and i cook my own meal and stuff

876
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:52,760
it feels empowering and it feels like i've just i've just fucking i've done it i've reached godly

877
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:59,640
status and i've walked a mile and you know i've done it i've defeated health that's exactly right

878
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,840
munchie it's it's so like like a lot of people will be turned off by it but like you really have to

879
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:11,160
like push through it and once you're done with it i guarantee it will be worth it and you will feel

880
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,560
like you've accomplished something there is one concept that separates us from the animals

881
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:21,560
now set it before but it is delayed gratification delayed gratification is the entire reason why

882
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,320
humans have gotten to the place we're at right now because we were willing to put an effort in

883
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,840
the short term uh to get greater results in the long term that's how we started farming way back

884
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:38,280
in the day yeah go on it's not even like directly like yes like i i've done this you know hard thing

885
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,880
but i will be rewarded later because i will be thinner it just i will wait wait wait i will be

886
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:51,720
rewarded by the lord of light there we go everyone yeah nice good it's just like almost immediately

887
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:59,800
after eating good food especially stuff like broccoli right it feels good it broccoli i don't

888
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,760
even like you're a good person if that's true it does but i don't even mean long term isn't like

889
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,680
you know in a year you'll feel better i mean that like when you're in the when you're in the planning

890
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,640
stages of like what am i gonna eat i've got like i've got some food in my fridge i could cook

891
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:20,120
or i could order i hop pancakes never delivered here i got these two choices and like the easy

892
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:26,600
way is just like order that shit but we all know the right answer instantly i ordered pancakes from

893
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,960
i hop not yesterday but the day before that's just because i like it's not even it is barbaric

894
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,920
it's not even a health thing it's just like a it's like an i hop pancake why are you doing this

895
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,640
okay there my my my pitiful excuse that i would never accept from anyone was just that i felt sick

896
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,960
and wanted pancakes that's my that's my excuse it's fucking i i hop is like the worst i did get

chicken broth you need it you need a soups you're right oh my god okay this is slightly off topic

906
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:45,080

01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,800
but you get a lot of good shit in there as well well not if not if you eat uh not if you eat that

and we'll retweet it from the twitter there you go PCP fit hard oh christ we're making this hard

928
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,640
I don't understand anything uh delete something something like that

929
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:01,160
uh do it fucking do it okay does anyone else have a final resting place they would I do yeah

930
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:08,840
basically the nice part about fitness is that it makes you better at everything literally

931
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:15,560
everything thinking moving around lifting up household objects going from point A to point B

932
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,480
it's one of those things where it's like there's no logical reason not to do it unless you're

933
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,360
trying to get the world record for world's fattest man other than that though like it's one of those

934
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,480
things where even if you're not an athlete it's still important to maintain a basic level like

935
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,640
because it just like I said it makes you better at everything so why not do it that's actually true

936
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,600
just like like there there have been times in my life where I've been like somewhat normal and not

937
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:46,440
the monster that that stands before me today and it just like feels better to be alive it feels like

938
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,040
like it's like after like you know I do something healthy it just feels good to just sit back down

939
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,320
your computer and just breathe in that that good air with your with your good spartan lungs I often

940
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,880
think about it like this like think about the human beings that we are descended from you know

941
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,440
they were out fucking running around every single day and if you're literally just sitting in front

942
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,480
of a computer every day you're probably doing something wrong you're not doing what your body

943
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:18,120
requires to to operate at maximum capacity so don't think fitness is not an option fitness is not

944
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:24,680
an optional thing that you can maybe do if you want to get super rips everyone should exercise in some

945
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,640
capacity you should do it every single day even I don't do it every single day but we all should

946
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,920
do it every day that is the ideal and that is what we should all be shooting to be doing and if

947
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,480
you're not I think yeah I mean you know you're fucking up a little bit you're fucking up I think

948
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:46,200
if if people have like a difficulty just try and add on try and do something that you wanted to do

949
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,080
that just so happens to be physical like if you want to get better you want to level up pokemon

950
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:56,040
go you can go for more walks that's a very easy one if you have a dog you can walk the dog and do

951
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,000
you know that that's exercising itself if you want you know you could do an instrument or you

952
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,560
know a plan of drums would get you a lot of a lot of movement you know just pick a hobby that is

953
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:13,640
like collaterally exercising you if you can't like share the thought of just going and and doing it

954
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,000
by itself I know this advice might seem somewhat shallow especially coming from me because obviously

955
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,880
I I'm preaching and not doing but I genuinely do like like have a lot of respect for people who

956
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,480
do fitness because it is just a like a real good and it's it takes it's a massive undertaking to

957
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:37,880
you know do it consistently and become a fitness ubermensch and it's really inspiring and great

958
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,120
I'm not going to change anything in my life basically but uh good it's good well it's not

959
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,200
important to be an ubermensch it's so it's it's enough because like that that was the thing with

960
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,600
the the whole competitive like nature of like school is like oh if you're not the most fit then

961
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:58,760
what are you even doing like it's not important to be the biggest boy it's just important to be

962
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,520
not a piece of shit exactly right uh-huh also one more thing I want to add is that a lot of people

963
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,240
they don't want to change their diet or their exercise because they want to wait until it's

964
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:15,640
like a convenient time in their lives to do it but there is never a convenient time you are dying

965
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,000
right now that's the good point the first best time to get started was yesterday but the second

966
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,920
best time is right now yeah that that is the most important thing begin immediately uh just

967
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,560
like I say in my like me a math of a shit it's like like if you're inspired by something if you

968
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,560
just if you realize there's something you should have been doing all along the time to start immediately

969
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,680
not tomorrow not the next day just you know in whatever capacity you can begin looking into a

970
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:47,320
take that walk take that walk right now start lifting your mindset episode go right now get

971
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:52,920
your fucking heart or no nine guys there goes to do it and then listen to this while you walk

972
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,600
you know or whatever you want to do yeah listen you'll probably be listening for a half no you'll

973
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,520
take a half an hour walk probably if you listen to the end of this or give or take and you'll be

974
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:05,640
so happy that you did I guarantee while we uh while we answer our fucking pity questions and our

975
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,720
pcp patron line questions right are we are we wrapping up are we are we headed in the in that

976
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:17,320
direction I think we're wrapping up I think so I think so good you are a god hashtag pcp fit life

977
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,800
that's the one hashtag pcp fit life send us pictures you update us under shit we will retweet

978
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,320
them also suggestions for better names we will come up with a better name next week I like that

979
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,680
that's pretty good but whatever okay fair enough if it sticks then it'll stick uh all right let's

980
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:41,800
see what we got here questions from the twitter hashtag ask pcp pity questions um okay let me see

981
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:48,360
what we got here good questions seems like an oxymoron yeah well I mean fair enough fair enough

982
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:54,360
uh okay here we go here we go at chemotherapy chemotherapy asks uh do you think that all

983
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:01,160
criticism needs to be somewhat constructive to have any value or merit no well depends on what

984
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:07,080
they mean by constructive if they mean nice then of course not but if they mean like yeah there's

985
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:13,000
like like you when I hear constructive I just mean I can get something out of it I yeah I pretty much

986
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,680
I don't think like criticism okay constructive criticism is valuable to the creator theoretically

987
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:24,920
I don't think yeah that it needs to be valuable to the creator to be worth saying or worthwhile I

988
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,160
I agree I think sure I think most criticism is constructive like the only thing that would be

989
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:37,880
like unconstructive is like somebody complaining about something that isn't even true basically

990
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:43,240
basically but even but even that is like well there's they clearly had uh a misinterpretation

991
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,960
there's maybe not as clear as as you thought it was like that's a problem what if what if I you

992
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,960
know I'm watching one of your dark soul streams and I see you make a mistake and I have a thought

993
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,920
it's like well okay you should probably improve your skills and just for for for shorthand I say

994
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,760
that you should probably just you know get good that would be a positive change what do you know

995
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:09,000
what if I'm what if I'm waiting I'm I'm clicking f5 I'm refreshing day in day out just waiting on

996
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,040
the hypocrite channel for that fabled video series to find right you promised you promised

997
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:23,720
you for months now it's too late we believe that you promised me to finally grace our presence

998
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,000
it's been long enough

999
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:39,160
I'm dying I need it well most most constructive most comments that are criticizing they have

1000
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:45,000
like I mean people want to sound like the smart guys so they will make an explanation so like this

1001
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,240
is what I don't like about this even if they're completely wrong and they just misinterpreted it

1002
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,160
that's still like I mean you can never be perfect you can never communicate as we as we know that

1003
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:00,120
language doesn't work you can ever communicate perfectly to everybody so people will always miss

1004
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:07,480
miss certain things but there's always some way to improve the ability to explain what your point is

1005
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:13,720
in a way that less people will get confused so I think most criticism is constructive in that way

1006
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:21,400
I feel like okay okay criticism can come in a lot of ways I feel like if you are leaving a comment

1007
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,560
on a video on YouTube for example to be practical I feel like you I wouldn't I don't know if I want

1008
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:33,160
to use the word oh it but I feel like you should probably have some sort of constructive criticism

1009
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:38,360
in the sense that you at least like tell the person why something's bad I feel like an example of

1010
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:43,880
like a comment that's not good is you suck die but it yeah a comment that could be great is you suck

1011
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:49,880
die uh that to pay looks fake well you know what you know what I actually kind of what I'm explaining

1012
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:55,160
why you should die I kind of want to go back on that a little because I actually I am I consider

1013
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,720
myself a super charitable person in terms of like what other people say if someone comments on a video

1014
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,560
of mine you suck die remind I mean of course I'll I'll probably be just like oh my feelings but

1015
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:11,240
beyond that I'll think like okay why did this person say that and most likely I probably put

1016
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,200
something in a video that was like controversial or whatnot so and like you can look at it and just

1017
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,720
be like well okay this person is just expressing negative they're not being specific but we know

1018
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:25,160
that they said that for some reason unless we're like a pure troll I want to yeah but if we can

1019
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:30,280
just like if everyone's given you shit for like one thing you did wrong in a video let's say uh

1020
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,120
and you like you're aware that it could have been like a hot button issue and you get a comment

1021
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,920
like that then you could you could possibly charitably interpret that to be like uh here is yet

1022
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,600
another voice criticizing me for doing this thing well yeah yeah you don't you you have to understand

1023
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:51,560
the context yeah like yeah why the right thing but I think people do owe it to themselves to explain

1024
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,960
themselves because if they don't explain themselves there's a chance that the person they're talking

1025
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:01,160
to will never understand very true very true I'm not asking for a lot here I don't want to like

1026
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:06,600
here's what you did wrong here's what can be better like listen to my essay just like any indication

1027
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:12,680
of why I suck and should die is good enough just like tell me why a video yeah all right all right

1028
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:17,960
people can't read minds I mean sometimes people have a criticism that's like uh I don't know like

1029
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,000
like fit here has gotten criticism for just like uh people just straight up and make a video yeah

1030
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:28,440
I mean just as one example not that I agree of course but people have like criticized you for

1031
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,200
like exposing 2b2t to like the normos and that you know there's kind of just criticizing you on a

1032
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,000
fundamental concept like what you're doing but there's just a straight up disagreement on how like

1033
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,680
of course your big video about how um you know you're being uh exposing uh so I forget the name

1034
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,640
of the guy who owns the server whatever house yeah yeah that one that was so cool that was an intense

1035
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:54,840
fucking video I loved it but like so you I mean your your stuff like saved the server by by just

1036
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,560
bringing attention to it so of course if you were one of those like five people who was like playing

1037
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:05,720
2b2t back in those days and you know like you were like yay my secret club I love having like

1038
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,360
one other person online sometimes and of course now things have changed like oh look at these

1039
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,440
fucking you know noobs all showing up I could get why they wouldn't like that but you just have a

1040
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,920
fundamental different approach you're trying to like resuscitate a community here so that's a very

1041
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:25,400
fundamental disagreement in like intentions here so like that that criticism could be very like

1042
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,120
honest they could say it in a helpful way but if you just fundamentally disagree on the premise

1043
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:35,000
of their criticism then like frankly there's not a lot to take from it other than ah there are people

1044
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,520
who have a descending opinion on this thing uh-huh absolutely a lot of times too like when there is

1045
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:46,440
a criticism in that regard like oh you're exposing our server to the masses like I understand

1046
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,000
their genuine concern like they wanted their secret little club you know I totally get it so

1047
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:58,200
it's like I I sympathize with your situation but sadly I disagree with you that's that's what it

1048
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,800
comes down to what a great question this was actually really nice thank you froggy sleuth aka

1049

1053
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:40,520

1054
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,400
bar on our discord server so we'll actually read your question so it's not a pity question a mere

1055
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:52,120
pity question uh let's see what we got you got any picked out peeps I'm still looking a lot of them

1056
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:58,920
are either like essays or like what's your favorite anime tier uh okay okay here's the example of what

1057
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:07,480
we're getting here from zan what's your what what is your favorite healthy fat like they're so like

1058
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,800
okay oh uh what is that I got one I got one I got one I got one I got one I gotta get those omega

1059
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,520
sixes yeah well there's uh there so so fats are broken into a couple different kinds there are there

1060
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,760
are saturated fats and there are unsaturated fats then you've got poly unsaturated fats and you've

1061
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:27,720
got mono unsaturated fats you want the poly unsaturated fats are statistically speaking the most

1062
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,920
quote unquote healthy because what makes it a poly unsaturated is that so the way that a the way

1063
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:38,600
that a try glyceride which is what a fat molecule is the way it works is that it's got this string

1064
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,080
of like I think they're carbon atoms with lots of like hydrogens attached to the carbons off the

1065
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:50,280
side and what makes it an a saturated molecule is that when every possible link that has a hydrogen

1066
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,480
attacks to those carbon atoms is there it is saturated that it's got as much mass as possible

1067
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:01,560
but you can have a covalent double bond between carbon atoms that use up some of those possible

1068
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:07,160
links that could otherwise be attached to hydrogen atoms and so when you have like if you have that

1069
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,960
same molecule that just has lost a bunch of those hydrogens and you have like connections between

1070
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:17,560
those carbon atoms then it just has less mass because a lot of those hydrogen atoms are just

1071
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,000
missing and so it's like a lighter molecule than you'd otherwise have um and so uh so if you have

1072
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,240
a mono unsaturated that means a single hydrogen is missing which means it's a little bit lighter

1073
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:32,680
but if you have a poly unsaturated triglyceride that is a fat molecule that has is missing a whole

1074
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:37,800
at least two and probably more hydrogen atoms therefore it's it's less and the the good thing

1075
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:43,400
about those is those can absorb wayward hydrogen atoms in your digestive system which actually is

1076
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,120
a is a helpful healthy like cleansing mechanism because those extra hydrogen atoms hanging out

1077
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,960
in your gut can be negative for health and they they can like cause cancer and like can fuck up

1078
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:59,960
shit um uh so i'm gonna go with poly unsaturated triglyceride it's all it's all about those omega

1079
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,520
six is all about them fish oil pills it's all about those fish birds you know by the way an omega

1080
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:10,200
six uh what what an omega six means if i remember remember correctly is the omega refers to like

1081
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:16,200
a particular like end of the of the one of the molecules on the triglyceride and the six like

1082
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,920
is the number like from that end so i think if i remember correctly i think it omega six means

1083
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:26,680
like from the omega end of one of the strands of the carbon atoms like six down there is a missing

1084
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,880
carbon atom there and that's why like it counts up to that and like that's like good or something

1085
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,680
it's something along those lines it's about which like hydrogen atoms missing and it's healthier

1086
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,440
so there you go and that's why they're good because they clean up stray hydrogen atoms in your body

1087
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:45,080
couple from picture loan asks are there any foods that are objectively horrible should be avoided at

1088
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:52,280
all costs soda obviously is one soda is a big one so does a big one um what else is there uh you

1089
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,080
know i've actually been struggling because my favorite thing to consume in this world is orange

1090
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:05,160
juice orange juice yeah the thing is orange juice is terrifically calorie dense uh and it's isn't it

1091
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:10,440
good for digestion i mean fiber in it well it depends on your goals actually the thing about

1092
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:15,720
the thing about orange juice is that you you miss out on tons excuse me tons of fiber you would

1093
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,880
have gotten if you just eaten an orange so well true they always say that uh when it comes to

1094
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:25,000
vegetables drink your vegetables eat your fruits is the common thing they say because drinking fruit

1095
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,880
juice has a lot of calories and will you know make you fat whereas drinking vegetables like

1096
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,880
vegetables have way less calories and you get all like the the vitamins and stuff from a vegetable

1097
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,040
i've been drinking it so uh feel free to drink your vegetables and uh eat your eat your fruits

1098
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,600
everybody yeah so i've been cutting it down yeah yeah go on i was gonna say orange juice it has

1099
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,960
so much sugar in it and a lot of people think that oh it's a natural sugar so it's okay for me well

1100
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:57,000
i mean sugar comes from sugar cane it's natural ben you've been typing this entire

1101
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,040
fucking episode oh what the hell are you guys can you guys can hear that i've been hearing it the

1102
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:08,840
astronauts on the space station gonna hear that fucking keyboard been uh yeah all right we'll edit

1103
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:16,920
that out later well all right i should say so all right great um except for this one to make the

1104
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:23,480
joke work uh chill wise been from the page yeah yeah what are you doing this is i'm extremely

1105
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:31,640
interested in best workout mix like vapor music yeah music no no no you can't not vapor

1106
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:37,800
anything you need something to pump you up uh for me it's various anime openings that get me hyped

1107
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:44,120
and and that's pretty much what it is s cascade is mine but that's when it all comes tumbling down

1108
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:51,080
uh whenever i take off or land on an airplane i always time it so that i like the little intro

1109
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:59,160
starts in cascade i always try to time like everything in my life to be in line with cascade

1110
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:07,720
my only travels on 413 i'm a big fan of uh sabaton while hitting my dick with a hammer

1111
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:16,120
because it fills manliness that's gonna release so much testosterone into your system by doing

1112
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:21,240
that yeah that's that's you know we've been beating around the bush steroids don't bother just hit

1113
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,240
your dick with a hammer that you're really cutting out the middle man you need a joke you need a

1114
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:31,880
fucking joke there's no activity more beneficial to muscle gain than jelking that's for sure dude

1115
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:39,080
i'm the only muscle that matters that's my resolution to jelk hardcore yeah to jelk so hard

1116
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:45,480
that i elevate off the floor 30 feet it's gonna be like like i'm gonna like like i'm gonna like

1117
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,960
pull up next gonna be like such gravity with my hand that i'm going to like like i just like

1118
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,760
jump up without having to move any of my muscles next yeah next to the olympic clean and jerk

1119
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,120
is the equally renowned olympic jelk

1120
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:08,280
incredible oh excellent hey uh yellow poon asks uh have you guys seen pain and gain if so then

1121
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,720
how do you feel about the workout slash gym bro culture presented in movies now so pain and gain

1122
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:19,400
is like uh is like a muscle head kind of movie those guys become murderers and like go off the

1123
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:26,040
fucking rails so like this is a bit of an extreme example but a little bit a little like everything

1124
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:31,000
was great about pain and gain until they started murdering people uh like things are going really

1125
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:39,240
well i mean i think it improved okay fair enough but like there's a there's a spirit of camaraderie

1126
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,520
of brotherhood that that's nice with like gym buddies and whatnot and uh i can appreciate that

1127
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:50,920
spirit of unity and solidarity like like in pre-world war two germany you know everyone was

1128
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:57,400
really getting on board yeah we were weeding out the week and uh preserving the strong

1129
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:05,720
we were what Nate says oh uh i did some time in venezuela i moved here recently um yeah yeah uh i

1130
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:13,160
don't know i gym bro culture is kind of stereotypicalized and gets a bad rap but like i i don't know

1131
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,720
like there's a lot of quote-unquote gym bros like at the gym i go to but they're just like

1132
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:23,080
nice guys who like work normal blue collar jobs and then love working out and hanging out with

1133
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:29,080
each other and like this is like the demon of gym bro culture like guys having goals achieving them

1134
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:33,000
and feeling good about themselves oh no what a nightmare just because a lot of movie directors

1135
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,520
are fucking nerds yeah they're bunch of fucking fucking 98 pounds soaking wet twink-ass hollywood

1136
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,360
directors definitely true that's right that's right so they're like a fucking

1137
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,640
Chad stole Veronica from me in sixth grade i have you know you know even Steven Spielberg

1138
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:53,880
really needs to to hit the gym you know who smashes the post you know who gets all the girls

1139
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:03,880
and lifts 5 000 pounds a day my hero sam hide and just like him i i persevere on my path towards

1140
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:10,040
greatness that's right that's right um all right like i i think we're pretty good at questions

1141
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,280
though there is one other section i wanted to do which is our fan art appreciation section

1142
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:19,000
oh that we're we're making a thing is this new do we now this is a new thing that's right that's

1143
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,520
it's a new thing now this will be brief there's there's not a lot to go through but there's

1144
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,440
keep this keep this brief i don't i don't want the yeah we don't i love i love it i love it i

1145
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:35,000
can't believe the pcb is ripping off right for us by having fan art yeah i know i'm looking at

1146
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,920
all things yeah now now here's a great one i love this this comes from our boy dino spinach

1147
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,840
now let me post this in the chat here take a look at this masterpiece this is a color

1148
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:55,640
profile selector i i'm gonna be honest with you this this has been like a common rebuttal to

1149
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,880
mean bends you know talking in the reference cop killers episode about pcb colors and this approach

1150
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:08,760
of two colors makes no sense no it's no i don't agree it makes perfect no sense it makes okay

1151
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,840
why i think the two colors the rowdy fuckers house is divided therefore it's invalidated okay i i think

1152
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,880
yeah i don't know this is great and i like it because mine is the best um and that's all there is to

1153
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,680
it um you look like a delicious black i guess my one problem is that hippo and debu are too similar

1154
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:31,720
i i think the concept of having two colors is okay i just think most of these choices are kind of

1155
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,920
bad especially mine which looks like shit um i guess what what what's sensitive you know yeah i

1156
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:42,840
think this person took the like like yours only makes sense with that avatar which like you know

1157
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,840
you get a couple of these i would i wouldn't fully agree with like i mean i love mine i love mine i think

1158
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:55,400
that yours is i would give you but like the entire the entire well okay i don't like your

1159
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,520
because your color scheme there is the rowdy fucking color scheme well well muchy we're talking

1160
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,640
primary and secondary color so everyone has their primary color and then there's also a secondary

1161
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:11,160
color used for it i don't fucking know whatever it doesn't matter yeah whatever you wish whatever

1162
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:18,600
you please i don't understand why what is not hard to understand i don't there's no

1163
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,120
point to me there's no point to me there's no point to you get it why don't we actually do our

1164
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,680
buddy dino spanish the currency of reading his text that he provided with this as a sort of guide

1165
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,280
so let me read it's a couple of sentences here here we go so i thought about this during the

1166
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,440
ratifocus cop kill is getting over it with ben at faady episode uh but i got motivated to make this

1167
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,120
after the free speech podcast if for no other reason then it forced me to work and something

1168
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,560
aren't related okay blah blah who cares let's get let's get back to us let's let's keep it on focus

1169
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:48,280
here um i feel like giving each member a dual color profile makes it easier to use similar

1170
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:53,240
colors that are shared by pcb members it's magenta ish colors for digi and mage cyan turquoisey

1171
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:57,400
colors for divu and hippo as well as being more visually cohesive for members that have more than

1172
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,960
one color typically associated with them like ben's black and white also it makes it easy to come up

1173
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,600
with simplified avatars if need be if the bcb wants to streamline the aesthetics of the podcast

1174
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,160
screen these are good reasons these are good thoughts i like i like ben's i like digis and

1175
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:17,080
mages tom's is a bit i don't know tom's is interesting it's that blue is exactly the same

1176
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:21,960
as divu's aesthetically tom's is a little true that's true actually i mean i think this mine

1177
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,840
mine isn't cool it's not the right type yeah this is the real shit i don't like okay i love how

1178
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:32,520
this is the fan art appreciation and we are shitting well this is like a business decision

1179
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:39,800
egg yeah we're talking about the real shit it's i i when i really i really give this the the the

1180
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,200
i think like this dual color system even if we don't like the specific colors offered

1181
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:50,120
is a good idea i do a backup secondary color i like it i i i will die on this hill i will

1182
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:57,560
fucking die okay i absolutely oppose i mean i maybe i'm biased because i as the black and

1183
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:05,400
white guy i am kind of you know i need to you know one one doesn't do it for me um uh sure sure

1184
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:11,400
but i think it's makes sense for everyone else you know i mean we need unity we can't have this

1185
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:17,320
this do you think colors when you do you think that can be magenta or it can be purple willy

1186
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:23,080
nilly no we need the hardbacks we need one well the one is the primary the one is the

1187
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,320
should the one should be the primary one even have the secondary if it oh it doesn't matter at all

1188
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:31,320
no just pay just the primary well just just a further differentiate because there's not that

1189
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:36,920
many colors on the wheel we need to have them be separate enough so they don't need a secondary

1190
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:41,720
munchie do you think they can stand alone do you think that this is like a mealy mouth kind of

1191
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:48,600
like limperisted compromise that is like like like like not like like too too much of a compromise

1192
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,800
to even be worth doing i think it's too much of a compromise and i think that it we like we're not

1193
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,520
paying attention to what really matters and that's what's giving like the reason we're talking about

1194
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,440
is because every person needs to be defined by one color that makes them stand out well primary

1195
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:11,640
colors and secondary little baby colors if they just complicate things further oh just for clarity

1196
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:17,480
to help when when necessary you know there can't be no help that's cheating that is fucking cheating

1197
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:23,880
we didn't have one color that's the point is if we have one color that makes it so that you can

1198
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,920
easily identify them from a glitch you can't have a fucking magnifying glass finding oh oh the

1199
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:35,640
primary colors in each fucking drawing of nate you can't have that all right here's the thing

1200
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:45,960
there will be like a the most like good-looking collection of all the colors if we if everyone

1201
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:51,560
is together but i think the point of having a secondary color is if like two of them

1202
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:58,360
when they're just alone like two people uh using their primary color the primary and color of

1203
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:03,080
both people is is you know it's too similar so one of them can use their secondary color

1204
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:07,960
and i guess that's the point but i still feel like i feel like i feel like i'm agreeing

1205
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:14,760
