1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello and we're back, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Uh, we missed it entire week.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Or two.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Three, no three.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Three, oh my god.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think we missed, yeah, by the time this episode comes out, we'll have missed three.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But that's okay.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Uh, anyway, we're back.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I went to America.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You were in America.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I forget what happened on the last episode.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I forget what happened the whole time you were here.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, I wrote down notes.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not going to read them, they're just like personal, like journal notes.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Cause that's what I like doing.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I like remembering fun times.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I flew to America into Boston to hang out with people I know and friends, and Ben St. as well.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Who has included new friends.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't you, don't you spin that.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hang out with friends and Ben St.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Gibbon and friends and Ben St.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I like it.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And then you were here for a million fucking years.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was here for about three weeks because of a COVID incident.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It caused me to be bedridden.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I had to change my flight.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And that was, that was a whole thing.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I guess that's the cliff's notes.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's enough information to understand what happened.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, it's, honestly, it was such a, it feels like a whole arc transpired during that time.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There was, there was the initial Gib is visiting arc.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Then there was COVID arc.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then there was a,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Gib is visiting again arc.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then there was post COVID scramble to figure out, Gib is scrambling to figure out how she's getting home.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And also let's hang out before she leaves again arc.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, basically.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It was a three act structure.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The second act was the darkest hour.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just like Star Wars.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just like acts.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Uh, yeah.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, so.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Boston's really cool, by the way.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I like Boston a lot.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think it's good.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a good place.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think I'd only been in Boston during the winter.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Cause we were, we were, I was in Boston.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think, I think the first time was Radcon 3, right?

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That house.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, Radcon 3 was not, was in Sharon, which was.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Massachusetts.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sort of.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the first time in Massachusetts.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We might have gone to Boston once or twice.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Um, but yeah.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It was interesting.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I landed in Boston.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I took the train out.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, yeah.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that makes perfect sense, actually.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Um, but yeah.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The other times was a arm retrieval con, which followed Radcon 3, which was.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
More in Boston.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or was directly in Boston.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I saw sites, but it was like freezing cold.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Um, the other time.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There wasn't, there was another time that was, I don't even remember really.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Like, you know, well there's, there's, there's like maybe two other times.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't think though.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Uh, the one I'm, I'm remembering is the weird PCP meeting that was just sort of like between

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
name Trixie talking about how to do like, uh, uh, can't hear or something.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They would discuss the bizarre, the bizarre, the bizarre meeting that had to be in person

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in which they discussed like, should I move here?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Answer yes.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And then it turns out they both moved to Virginia instead.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Eventually.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Genius.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Geniuses at work.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean, whatever.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I had fun during that cause I was just, I was just there to hang out.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I wasn't part of the meeting.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was funny.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think we called that rad con 3.5, right?

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That was in between.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then, yeah, I bet.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All right.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know how long that time was.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I guess we went out at some point.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I remember meeting econ.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I remember like Ukrainian Zagok.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who's not actually Ukrainian.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think just Zagok, the artist guy.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He was around.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Randomly.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And there was like, we had Chinese food at some point.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And Pokemon Go in the Commons.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Pokemon Go in the Commons, which was like God, like deathly freezing like, oh shit,

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
let's get inside and not enjoy the outside tour.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think that was that.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So it was not actually two other times.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was three times.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, basically two times.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This time was June.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So it was nice and warm.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it's beautiful.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's really nice just walking around.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I love the architecture.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I love the architectural like variability.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I love the the the vibe of like the entire place is just like great.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I am glad you think so.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I also think so, but I'm afraid to say it because because then the West Coast people

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
will attack me for being biased.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll start.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll start a beef.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, I mean, I haven't been to the West Coast, so I guess I don't know.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean, me, me either.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've heard it.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is it is it just like?

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, I've been to the West Coast, but I haven't.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or is it like the whole West Coast?

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because it's lower down.

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's more southern.

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's I think the West Coast.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think it's warmer.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Like, I mean, it gets cold when you go way up north.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But if even like Oregon is still like not that it's not not especially cold.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I mean, it does snow there.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I found I found the temperature in Boston during summer to be like warm, but not like

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so warm that I am at risk of dehydration to a point where I would need to go to hospital

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
like like a one time when I was in Greece that happened.

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And that was fun.

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, you came at the right time of year.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The it does get it does get blisteringly hot sometimes, but it's not it's not there yet.

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, OK.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It gets blistering, you know, in like late July and August.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, it makes sense.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is this was nice.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This was like almost familiar.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It feels like that in London sometimes very rarely, but it's quite nice and hot today.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hey, how's the weather over there?

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, that's the conversation we're having now.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, what do you think of those clouds?

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I like them.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
They like them.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know, did you did you ride the tea much?

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't remember if we rode the tea.

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We mostly took buses around.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, I wasn't with you the whole time.

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was staying with Munchie.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And in his apartment and Munchie loves the tea and we did take the buses to get around.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And yeah, I do like the trains that I rode the green line mostly.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And there was like a new train on the green line and it was shiny.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have still I have still not taken I still not taken the new the new green line.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The one that goes up to the one that goes up like fairly close to where I used to live that I would have would have been pretty convenient for me at one point in time.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But oh well.

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's gonna I was gonna ride that train, but I didn't maybe maybe one day.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, it was it was so new.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was like the buttons to like, I don't know, stop the train.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Didn't feel like they had been pressed by human yet.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's like, wow, like brand new spanking.

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I see.

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The tea is great.

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I had my Charlie card from that one time and it actually accepted my credit card perfectly.

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I could just I could just use it like a real Boston commuter.

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, man.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sick.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, that's great.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I mean, I rode the I rode the London Tube once, but I didn't get a that strong of a sense of how it compares really.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I don't know.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The main difference is that London is a gargantuan behemoth of a city.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And so right unless you are like a weirdo, you don't need to ever travel like 90% of it.

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I frequent like two lines because one of them goes to the airport and the other one just goes north to south and it's close to where I live.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So I can I can get on one of those stations and go and it's like, um, I don't really ever need.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I mean, it's it's really interconnected.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The London Tube, you can go from any station relatively quickly to switch to like a line or a station, you can get to a station that goes to a different line.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And there's lots of like, what would you call them, not junctions.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Stations that have multiple different lines in them.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can walk from.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, from.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So like if you're in the tube, you can get anywhere.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But it does take a while.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think from from one, the Piccadilly line that goes to Heathrow takes like two and a half hours to go from like the train from the from the airport all the way to the end.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So it's a big long way.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In in Atlanta, they have a sort of like a T, but it's even smaller and it's literally just two lines and one goes north to south and the other goes east to west and they just cross in the middle.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, it's kind of cute.

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, so an even an even more condensed version there.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I remember I remember writing we rode the bus home from that from that furry from that furry meet up in that in that.

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
God, I forgot all about that.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That was so this is like so early on in the thing.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There was a furry meet up.

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It feels like it feels like three whole active past since then.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, I I drew like silly little give drawings in a bunch of notebooks and sketchbooks.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I didn't know who they were.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, only one of them was quite a like renowned furry porn artist.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I didn't know that was just funny.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I know.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I know about that guy sort of.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm not.

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't read his stuff.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, yeah.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Heterosexual.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's not.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He doesn't just jar gay stuff.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's Brea Bravern.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, yeah.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, that's the name.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The pony.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Unbelievable.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Can you believe in real life?

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's actually a human.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I always thought he drew with those hooves.

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Just like phantom horn.

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I love that video.

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Just like phantom horn was little blue hooves.

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That was like, I remember seeing that for the first time on T-Bap.

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it was like, wow, you're really going, you're like making skits with props.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah.

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And there's like effort being put in.

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
These are effort posts now.

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I thought they were just like, you know, kind of funny guys talking on YouTube.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And now they're effort posting and you started doing all these skits.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And that was one of the earlier ones, I think.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I peaked with that one.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think I just, I don't know, somehow I just got it in my head like, hey, phantom draws.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What if I showed him trying to draw with this little, the little frost that it coos.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It was just too good an idea not to do.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It was really good.

261
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The cool, man, the camera quality on that video is dog shit.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It looks like, it looks so bad.

264
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I mean, whatever.

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It worked.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can tell what's going on.

267
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Speaking, a little bit of a change of topic and we can get back to other stuff if you want.

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But speaking of shitty camera quality, I've been, I've been buying stuff lately.

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've been, I guess I would say I've been investing in capital.

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's not really true.

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, sort of.

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've been investing in the means of production for, to make some, to do the, the alternate version of that thing that I was going to do while you were here.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You remember the thing people were calling my secret project.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Which I don't, which I don't want to spill.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I still do not want to spill the beans on it yet because.

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, I was wondering if you were going to talk about it.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I do, I do want to talk about it.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The short.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The short answer is that my COVID meant that I couldn't go to it.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So it didn't happen that way.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And now I'm gone.

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The, what was it?

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh yeah.

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I made a post on my Patreon.

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I did a Q&A like, like solo podcast, not, not.

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you call a blog that's a podcast?

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's not a blog.

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
A blog.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I did a Q&A post where I talked about the situation with that and I explained what it is more.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So I won't go into detail, but the short version is that the, yes, I had an idea for

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
what, for a thing to do while you were here and then COVID meant that it couldn't happen.

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And so I have re, I have reconfigured the idea into something that I can do by myself.

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And instead of, I was going to hire a guy.

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was going to hire a guy to do some work on it for me.

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So instead of that, I'm just going to buy some stuff that's going to let me do it myself.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So instead of the sex tape we were going to make, it's actually just going to be Ben St.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Jack-in-off.

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's, you know, it's, it's less sensational, but I get to, but at least I own 100% of the

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
final product.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So fuck, fuck she's sharing the rights.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've been buying, I bought a new microphone.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm not using it right now.

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm still using the shitty snowball ice, but I have a real big boy XLR mic now on like,

311
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
not just that, it's on one of those like retractable mechanical arms that you can kind of manipulate

312
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and move around.

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah.

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So that's, that's pretty fancy.

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It plugs into a real, what do you call them?

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The boxes that you plug the microphones into.

317
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
An audio interface.

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
An interface.

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was looking around for, I was looking around for recommendations on that.

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I got one that everyone said was a good deal.

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I was going to try buying a new camera, but I'm going to wait.

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going, I'm not going to buy a camera just yet because I think it might be doable to just

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
film with my smartphone.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh yeah.

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I've never really thought to try making a long thing, like a video with a, other than

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
like, oh, this could be like a tweet or I just want to remember this five seconds, filming

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
a long thing with a, with a phone.

329
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I always worry about like, oh, isn't it going to fill up with space?

330
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Isn't the battery going to drain?

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, it doesn't have to do that.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It doesn't, it doesn't have to be all one take.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So it's, it's okay if I like have to stop in the middle and like transfer the, the video

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and then like start filming again, like afterwards.

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think it's probably better to just try to film with my smartphone and see if that gives

337
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
me like, like I don't need to film in 4k.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like I don't care about that.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like as 1080p is fine.

340
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I think it can do that.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I don't, the alternative is to spend like $300 on a new digital camera and like,

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't know if I need, why do I do that needlessly?

344
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So it's fine.

345
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, my screen just turned off for some reason.

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Anyway, it's been spending money, but it's good because in theory, I will use these products

348
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to generate revenue for myself and that is, and isn't that what it's all about at the

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
end of the day?

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Generating revenues.

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, I love that.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know, speaking of generating revenues.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hell yeah.

355
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't want to get too into like the nitty gritty because it doesn't really matter, but airplane

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
bullshit because of the COVID and having to rebook a flight means that I had to pay for

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
a new flight and I had to pay for a new flight like soon at the time because I don't want

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
to like overstay my welcome.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I could have stayed even longer, but it would have gotten like weird.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So I got the cheapest available option in like, it was like 10 days or so after I had

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
recovered was when I left.

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah.

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So it's quite a long, quite a long great trip, honestly.

365
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Worth it.

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Worth getting COVID.

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But it didn't have to buy like a plane ticket close to like a plane ticket to London in

368
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the summer close to the departure date is very expensive.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Did you end up getting, I was going to say you ended up getting screwed on the price,

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
right?

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because you had to like move the timetable up.

372
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So I've been doing some commissions.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I made a tweet about it.

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm doing like thin line, simple sketchy sometimes with color.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If you want to pay more, there's commissions art.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll draw for money so I can pay for that.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've gotten, let me check.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've got my spreadsheet here.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So I've gotten like 12 so far.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And I finished one, two, three, four, five, five of them.

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I got a few to do, but they are still open.

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll keep them open for maybe a week or two.

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just in case people have not heard about it yet and will hear about it first time here.

386
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going to draw for you.

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You have to pay me though.

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's the only catch.

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What the fuck?

390
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay.

391
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
All right.

392
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why didn't anyone think of this before?

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't know.

394
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I saw one you did of like a cat girl or a bunny girl who was white.

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That looked really good.

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah.

397
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, thank you.

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I saw, I walked in on you drawing that.

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's drawn on my iPad.

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was very, that one I think it was pretty good.

402
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think that's the only one that I've seen.

403
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I posted some others to Twitter.

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Nobody will ever see the other ones because I am doing not-safe work commissions as well.

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, sure.

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And those are epic, but you can't see those.

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't even ask.

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You're not going to post those on Big Girl Squish?

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I already have, but now they know where to find them.

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Whoops.

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Excuse me.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nah, it's fine.

414
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's not like a, it's like an open secret.

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I won't mention it like all the time.

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But yeah.

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think I did a really good horse that like a lot of furries found in light.

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So that's pretty good.

419
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, I really liked that drawing you did of Virginia.

420
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Sorry, Vermont.

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This is a different universe.

423
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, I forgot.

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I had, I never posted your doodle in my copy of Lord of Ghosts.

425
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, yeah.

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah.

427
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I have it.

428
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I have it here in my drawer.

429
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I should take a screenshot of that and post it.

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's really good.

431
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's Phantom on Virginia.

432
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm glad you like it.

433
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I love it.

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I was, I'm torn because part of me thinks it would be cool to take my Copics and like

435
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
color it in.

436
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And part of me is like, no, don't touch it.

437
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It must be preserved just as it was.

438
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I mean, you could, you could like scan it in or take a picture and color it on, on the,

439
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
on the old computer.

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's, that's true.

441
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Or you could like photocopy it and draw it.

442
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I mean, that's obviously not the same thing.

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I mean, I mean, yeah, the, the, the one, the one in the book is the, is the, is the real

444
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
one.

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know.

446
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know.

447
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Uh, I should mention now that I have my copy, I should say on the podcast that the book

448
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
came out really nice.

449
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, thanks.

450
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And so did the red man zine.

451
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was actually, I said this, I told you this before, but I'll say it again for the record.

452
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Uh, I was really surprised like that it's like perfect bound and like high quality.

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I was picturing it being like a staple bound, like, you know, like, like a zine.

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

455
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

456
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's, it's because there's so many pages.

457
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I couldn't do staple.

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

459
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It had to be a thick boy.

460
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's the other thing.

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's way more than I thought they were.

462
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The red man book is awesome.

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Like it's, it's really great.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Uh, I'm pretty proud of that.

465
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's like such stupid subject matter, but it's really nice.

466
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And a nice little product.

467
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I like it a lot.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And the, the Lord of Ghost book is also, it's much bigger than I had like pictured it being.

469
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's quite substantial.

470
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It was like a hundred, it's like a hundred pages or so or something pages.

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah.

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's really nice.

474
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Uh, it's, uh, it's one of my, it's my, it goes in my drawer where I keep books that

475
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I like.

476
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm happy to have it.

477
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

478
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Um, oh, in my pin, of course, my Lord of Ghost pin.

479
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You know what?

480
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll still wear it.

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,200
I was going to wear it for that thing that we didn't do, but I will still wear it when

482
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,000
I do it in the other way.

483
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I, I hate being so cagey about it.

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I mean, it makes, it's obvious that you're filming something.

485
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm obviously filming something.

486
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

487
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So you can call it a video.

488
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, no, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a multimedia, uh, it's a movie.

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's actually making a feature film starring me and a Lord of Ghost pin.

491
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's the only information you have.

492
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I hope, I hope that doesn't, I hope that doesn't give it away, but you know what?

493
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If it does, who cares?

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I just don't want to talk about it because if I talk about it, then I won't have the

495
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
motivation to, to finish doing it.

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I just want to finish it.

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Um, yeah.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's, that's the, um, the UK mixam company that the printed those.

500
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

501
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's the one you were thinking of.

502
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Which I might use for slime and punishment, which I am ashamed to admit I have still

503
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
not finished the footnotes for.

504
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I have done like most of them.

505
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, you've, you've talked about like how in depth some of these notes are getting

506
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
like how many things you want to reference in each page.

507
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Some of them are very in depth and some of them I have to like look up stuff and like

508
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
confirm things.

509
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And, um, when they're done, I'm going to hand them off to some like old RFCK heads to

510
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
ask them like, Hey, can you like proofread these and like tell me did I miss anything

511
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
or tell me did I get anything wrong?

512
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They're not that long.

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think I've written maybe like 16 pages worth of notes on them, which is not like a huge

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
amount of writing, but because I'm trying to be like scrupulous about getting the details

515
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
right and I have to do sort of like research on it.

516
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's a little, it should be, it should have been done, but it's not because I've had to

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
split my attention.

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've had to split my attention between there's that there's finishing the footnotes for the

519
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
book.

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There was working on the video project and then working on reconfiguring the video project

521
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
into a new form once I had to change it.

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then gummy making, obviously gummy making is a high priority.

523
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That can't be neglected.

524
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I perfected, I perfected my recipe over this period.

525
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I found, I found what I think is that is, I'll never call it the final recipe, but I'll call

526
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
it a final recipe that I'm happy with.

527
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And I don't know what I'm going to do with that.

528
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
She was telling me that he thinks I should like offer it.

529
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's like a care pack.

530
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He was saying something about trying to monetize it.

531
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
My idea was like, what if I did like a Patreon supporters, like quarterly care package or

532
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
something?

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I think Tom does something like that.

534
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I think I mean, Trixie used to do care packages care packages.

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Like, I, I mean, I've mailed so many Lord of Ghost things.

536
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't want to ever mail things again.

537
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I want to post a box.

538
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That sucks.

539
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
How could you do something like that regularly?

540
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's, yeah, I was going to, like I would not like monthly would be too often.

541
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Quarterly would be okay.

542
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And it would have to be for people who were pledging like 25 bucks or something.

543
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like it wouldn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't just be for any old $5.

544
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Shlub.

545
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because it is like actually quite, quite annoying.

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm actually not even sure if you can send food in the mail.

547
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, yeah, you must be able to.

548
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think, I think you're allowed to send food in the mail.

549
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's just people will likely not, unless it's from a company and it's perfectly sealed.

550
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, you send food to a random person and it's like just something that could,

551
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
could have been easily tampered with.

552
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
People will be like a priestess about it.

553
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think it might be liquids.

554
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I think it might be like you might have to check a box and like pay a tax or something

555
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
if you send liquids in the mail.

556
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, but you could lie though.

557
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You could lie, you could lie.

558
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Are there like stories of like, I don't know, YouTubers or whatever streamers having like

559
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
PO boxes and they open it and it's like, it's diarrhea.

560
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, who put diarrhea in the mail?

561
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And that's why you don't have a PO box.

562
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Bad idea.

563
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I have to, I have to get a new PO box.

564
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I think I may have mentioned that my old PO box expired.

565
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
My old PO box expired and I feel like it's almost certain that some packages that I sent

566
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
probably got returned in the mail and I'd never found them because the PO box was canceled.

567
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And probably there are a couple people who never got stuff they bought from me.

568
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I will never know unless they tell me about it because I had no PO box to receive their

569
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
return to sendered, unsuccessfully delivered packages.

570
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I had one person message me to tell me they never got their thing and I still have,

571
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I just have to send his replacement still, but I will.

572
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And I found like four other packages that had been returned before the PO box had expired.

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I did get those and none of those people like told me, none of those people like mentioned to me that they

574
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
didn't get their packages yet, even though it's been like four months, which is kind of surprising.

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They forgot they bought it, but I'll get those recent as well.

576
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Actually, the hold up there is that the packages have the real names on them.

577
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And like, I don't remember whose screen name corresponds to what real name.

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I am like not, so I have to comb through like my PayPal transactions and my Twitter DMs

579
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
in order to try and find like who is who.

580
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I haven't done that yet.

581
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And it's going to be really annoying.

582
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
This is one of those things I've in my spreadsheet I made to keep track of a lot of ghost things.

583
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I made a point to like, you know, their name and their preferred name.

584
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If I was going to like put their name in the back if they had like a different name to their real name.

585
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then like their email address, you know, just ways to contact this one person and then what they ordered.

586
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I can be like, okay, this person has messaged me on Discord.

587
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Who are they? Oh, they're that guy.

588
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's made a lot of things simple, but some people like just never got back on anything.

589
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So I just don't know.

590
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I tried messaging on Kickstarter and that's all I know them from.

591
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So yeah, like two people at this point.

592
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, that's still one of them is going to supposed to get the plush and they just haven't messaged me still.

593
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, right. I got my plush. I've got the plush too.

594
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Going to have an extra.

595
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's sitting up on my shelf next to my collectible Sonic the Hedgehog glasses.

596
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Different topic.

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I purchased an adapter for a PlayStation controller to plug the PlayStation controller into this USB adapter

598
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and then plug the USB adapter into my computer to try and play games with it.

599
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And it doesn't work and it makes me really mad.

600
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It recognizes the controller.

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But then when I look at the inputs, it does not recognize any inputs from it.

602
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No matter what I do, I tried downloading all these different drivers.

603
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
None of them work or do anything about it.

604
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
In the end, I gave up and I just bought a PlayStation 3 controller, which supposedly works without any need for an adapter.

605
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Wait, what controller were you using?

606
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I was using an original PlayStation 1 controller with no DualShox.

607
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Without the double twin sticks.

608
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Because I just had one.

609
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
A family friend got me one for Christmas like two years ago, I think.

610
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I was disappointed because that was the controller I wanted to use.

611
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But oh well, the PlayStation 3...

612
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It cost me like 15 bucks.

613
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's just annoying that the adapter was totally worthless.

614
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I think I did everything I could with that too. I really tried.

615
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I got the Xbox One controller for PC gaming, which is apparently a really good one.

616
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The Xbox Series X controller is a bit...

617
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's fine apparently, but worse in ways.

618
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's a good gaming one I've heard.

619
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The Xbox One, which is kind of old now.

620
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I read online, sources that I looked up told me that to use a PlayStation 3 controller on your PC, you have to download drivers for an Xbox 360 controller.

621
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And that's what lets you use a PS3 controller on your computer for some reason.

622
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I haven't tried it yet, so I don't know if it's true.

623
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But that's what I read.

624
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I always go for Xbox just because it's also the computer people in Microsoft.

625
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So they're supposed to work without any issues.

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I guess that's true. I just like PlayStation better. I'm a PlayStation baby.

627
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I grew up using it, so I like the controller.

628
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That's it.

629
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's a good controller. I like the PlayStation 4 controller a lot.

630
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I've gotten so used to Xbox for PC gaming. It doesn't feel right otherwise.

631
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I was trying to play some games with the keyboard that were just...

632
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You just can't...

633
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Some games work, and other games it just fucking doesn't.

634
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
These were not working, so I was like, oh well, better invest in some hardware.

635
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Since I'm already buying all this other shit, so I did.

636
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The means of production. Are you going to make Let's Plays?

637
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No! I'm not going to make Let's Plays.

638
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Are you going to make Let's Streams?

639
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
No, the plan was not to stream, although I guess if I did ever stream again in my life and I wanted to play games,

640
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
you might as well use a...

641
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Right? Right?

642
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The stuff like the microphone, the camera, camera equipment, the tripod stuff.

643
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There's this current video idea that I needed to make, but it's like, okay, but I'm going to have it forever.

644
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I was thinking back...

645
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm thinking back. I'm honestly pretty embarrassed.

646
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's pretty embarrassing that video that I made in like 2021, like more than a year ago, where I...

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The Let's Read with Ululiliya's Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.

648
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The video quality on that is so garbage. The audio quality is trash.

649
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Why was I not willing to invest like anything in making that video decent?

650
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Like, well, I don't know what I was thinking.

651
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I mean, I could imagine you were thinking, well, I'm not really a YouTuber, so I don't need it forever.

652
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's a big investment, usually.

653
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, but I mean, what's the point of even doing it if I'm not even going to try to make it good?

654
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And second of all, it's not that much of a big investment.

655
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well...

656
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I mean, a lot of like pretty decent things have gotten very affordable over the years.

657
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, I mean, the new... the microphone that I got was like...

658
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It was like 70 bucks, but then there was like some other stuff.

659
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You know, the stand and the wires and the adapter was like another maybe like 100.

660
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So maybe like less than 200 bucks for a microphone upgrade.

661
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The camera...

662
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Well, I guess I would have had to spend a little more.

663
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Probably another 150 would have gotten me at least an acceptable camera for that.

664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know.

665
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know, the more I think about it...

666
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay, on the one hand, that particular video would probably not have justified the cost of those things,

667
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
but I would have had them forever.

668
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I would have then had like improved my production capabilities forever.

669
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So it would have been fine. It would have paid for itself in other ways.

670
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You got to invest in your future.

671
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay, that's all I have to say about that.

672
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I agree.

673
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean, I've used this microphone that I'm using right now for a long time.

674
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't actually remember when I put this.

675
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It may have been something like 2017.

676
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
A lot of things I've recorded with this.

677
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's definitely paid for itself.

678
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Econ gave me, or I think he sold it to me for very cheap, though.

679
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This snowball ice that I'm using now.

680
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I mean, it's perfectly fine.

681
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's a perfectly fine USB microphone.

682
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
A little bit worse than like a Blue Yeti, but whatever.

683
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You know, I forgot to mention there is another thing.

684
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I think you might have forgot because it probably got lost in the shuffle of other things that were happening.

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But do you remember that on the morning or the night before we were going to film the thing, my power went out?

686
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, I do remember this.

687
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You stumbled in and you were like, I'm so nervous.

688
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And my power went out.

689
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I was trying to do stuff to like prepare.

690
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And in the middle of it, like the power went out and I didn't have my computer.

691
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And I'm like, my resources.

692
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
My means of production.

693
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes, yes.

694
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It was horrible.

695
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It took me like a while to figure it out.

696
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I did eventually figure out that I had a power strip with a long enough cable to run into the kitchen.

697
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Which was only only my room and the adjacent room and the hallway had their power out.

698
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The kitchen's power was mostly still on.

699
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So I managed to use the outlet that powers the refrigerator to power not my whole room, but like I moved my table near my door so that it could power my computer.

700
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So I could use my computer.

701
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
My lights were out.

702
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
My room was had to be like completely rearranged.

703
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Anyway, this has continued to happen.

704
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It has happened twice more since then.

705
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So almost once a week since then.

706
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
My power has just died spontaneously.

707
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And every time I have to complain to my landlord and then the next day the power comes up.

708
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It has been a little while since, I think it's been more than a week since that last time it happened.

709
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But boy, I hope it stops.

710
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Although my computer table is still in the new position near the door plugged into the strip that's running from the kitchen.

711
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Just in case it happens again so my computer doesn't die.

712
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I have officially seen your place of residence.

713
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh God.

714
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Cringe.

715
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's not good.

716
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's not good.

717
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I hate it.

718
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I hate this place.

719
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I vaguely remember you talking about trying to or like thinking of leaving pretty soon.

720
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, actually my lease is up in only like less than three months.

721
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh wow.

722
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I actually, yeah, I was talking about like maybe just leave early, but like it's almost like too late.

723
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's too late to leave early, basically.

724
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I just have to start looking for another place like normal.

725
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Wait a minute.

726
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh my God.

727
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We're halfway through June already.

728
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yep.

729
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh my fucking God.

730
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
June, July.

731
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I've only got two and a half months.

732
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is a fucking nightmare.

733
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Start Googling.

734
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
No!

735
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You gotta do it.

736
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Last time I started looking with only like with only a month.

737
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I only gave myself a month to find a place and that was a mistake.

738
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So I mean, I'm doing better than I'm doing better.

739
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No.

740
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Now I'm thinking.

741
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't know.

742
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I feel like it shouldn't be hard to like get this thing filmed.

743
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I feel like there should be no problem getting this thing filmed and finishing the book and maybe even launching the Kickstarter in that time.

744
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But like also when I think about all those things, I feel like so crunched.

745
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Like I feel like I can't possibly do it all in only two and a half months, even though that's a long time.

746
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah.

747
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And then also look for a new place.

748
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

749
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes.

750
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Exactly.

751
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean, I would definitely prioritize a few things.

752
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Like if you're going to do the film, you don't want it to be suddenly continuity.

753
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, you're in a new place now and I'm just going to finish saying it.

754
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

755
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I mean, if I, yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't start filming it like the week I had to move.

756
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah.

757
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah.

758
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I mean, filming doesn't take too long if you have everything ready.

759
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, I would expect it to only take, I might, I could probably film it all in one day.

760
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe I would, maybe two days.

761
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yeah.

762
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And then once you've filmed it, editing can take however long it will take.

763
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And if you need to put it in the back while you look for a place, that's, you know, that's fine.

764
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What's taking a long time with it now is literally just waiting for all the like equipment that I bought to arrive in the mail.

765
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then once it's here, I'll need to set up like the shot.

766
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And I don't think that will be hard to do, but...

767
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Do you have a light?

768
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Let's see.

769
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Did you buy a light with everything?

770
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I did.

771
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I was thinking about that.

772
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I did not.

773
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Like I assume I would probably need like a good light to light the shot, but I don't really know what to get.

774
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah.

775
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I don't know too much about lighting myself because whenever I did like skits for Hippocrite or whatever,

776
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I would just use lamps that I had and then just point them around places and that did the job fairly well.

777
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The best thing is just having daylight come in, which lights the entire room quite a lot.

778
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay, but the thing about that is that then your shot changes as the day progresses.

779
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Sure, but that doesn't stop YouTubers from doing it and nobody seems to care.

780
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
They just be like, oh yeah, it got dark.

781
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So I'm just going to finish the video and then it's fine.

782
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I mean, yeah, to a certain extent, I'm sure it's fine.

783
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The point is having like a professional light or even just like a hobbyist light does a lot because it's not just the cool like lighting dynamic stuff.

784
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It just makes it easier for the camera to see what is happening and it makes it look higher quality.

785
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Like a good quality camera in low light will still look grainy and horrible.

786
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, and I was thinking about it and I just don't, I don't know what kind of light I need.

787
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And also like, I just don't have a lot of space in my room to like put up like a stand light.

788
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I guess I could probably like fold it up, put it in the corner when I'm done with it.

789
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I've seen like people use streamers and video people use like a donut light.

790
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Like it's a ring, I guess it's called a ring light.

791
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's a ring light, it's diffused and it's like you can stand it on a table or on a stand.

792
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And you put it behind the camera and it's like sort of diffused light shining straight at you.

793
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I also...

794
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The important thing is that it's diffusing because a direct light will be very harsh shadows.

795
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Hmm, yeah.

796
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah, I should get something, I should just look into.

797
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I looked into microphones, I found a mic that I thought was a good deal.

798
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I looked into cameras, I decided I'm gonna try to do it without a new camera and try to film with my smartphone if possible.

799
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I didn't look into lights yet, but I will do that.

800
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I think I probably need one.

801
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And then...

802
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Shit, I was going somewhere with that.

803
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Fuck.

804
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Do you think, so the other thing you talked about doing the book and the Kickstarter for making the book.

805
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh yeah.

806
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Like you're trying to do all that in one month.

807
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I feel like something has to go in the back burner.

808
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, I think I could finish...

809
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I feel like my plan was to finish the book and then send it off to a printer and then wait for the test copies to be printed and sent to me.

810
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And during that waiting period was when I would do the recording.

811
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Right.

812
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think that was my plan.

813
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And I think it's still the plan.

814
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And I think if I just finish the footnotes, that's like the...

815
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I have to draw a cover.

816
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I mean, that shouldn't be too hard.

817
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's a lot of work.

818
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It is a lot of work.

819
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, there's a lot of little things.

820
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I feel like you should prioritize getting the new place sorted.

821
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Because then if it turns out you get a good place, the video will be in a nicer location and you can do that then.

822
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You know, that's true.

823
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That's true.

824
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The other thing, and this is...

825
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm not sure if this is dumb.

826
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This might sound dumb, but I was testing out my webcam to see if I could get my settings to look better.

827
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And the answer is no.

828
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The webcam sucks.

829
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But I was looking at myself in the webcam and I noticed that in the webcam I could see a spot on my teeth.

830
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And that really bothered me.

831
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And I thought maybe I need to go to the dentist before I film this video.

832
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Maybe I need to do that first as well.

833
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So, I mean, go to the dentist has been on my to-do list for a long, long time.

834
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And every day that goes by, that becomes a more pressing concern.

835
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I've let it simmer for a long, long, long, long time.

836
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So, I mean, I do urgently need to do that.

837
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Do I need to more urgently do it than everything else?

838
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Maybe, no, maybe, I don't know, perhaps.

839
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I would say hold off on the recording, the video stuff.

840
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Get the book finished and have the thing said to you.

841
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And then look for a new place.

842
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Looking for a new place, the process of that involves sending a lot of emails,

843
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
waiting for replies, and then setting up dates to go and see places and visit people.

844
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's like a long process.

845
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
What I mean is in between waiting for stuff like that, you could be working on the footnotes of all the pages.

846
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Because that will take a while, probably.

847
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I hope it won't take me that much longer.

848
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm most of the way done with it.

849
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And I feel every day that goes by, I feel guilt and shame that it isn't done already.

850
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
No, Ben, you must feel positive vibes that your productivity will be better.

851
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

852
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm sorry.

853
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm sorry to do this.

854
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm sorry to quote, to read you this quote, because it is from a Republican.

855
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But I saw a really great wholesome meme recently.

856
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Here, I'm going to read it.

857
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I love this, but I almost retweeted it.

858
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But then I was like, no, I'm not that cringe.

859
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This is a great thing.

860
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This is on Reddit.

861
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I think it was a Reddit AMA.

862
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The guy asks, this is asking Arnold Schwarzenegger.

863
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
He asks, I know this is pandering, but I've been depressed for months and haven't hit the gym during that time.

864
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Mr. Schwarzenegger, can you please tell me to get off my lazy ass and hit the gym?

865
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I swear to everything I hold dear that I will snap out of it and go.

866
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And here was username GovSchwarzenegger's reply.

867
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'm not going to do the accent.

868
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm not going to be that hard on you.

869
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Please don't be that hard on yourself.

870
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We all go through challenges.

871
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
We all go through failure.

872
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Sometimes life is a workout.

873
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But the key thing is you get up.

874
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Just move a little.

875
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Roll out of bed and do some push-ups or go for a walk.

876
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Just do something one step at a time.

877
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I hope you feel better and get back to the gym.

878
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But don't beat yourself up because that's just useless talk.

879
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It doesn't get you closer to the gym.

880
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And don't be afraid to ask for help.

881
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Good luck.

882
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, I saw that as well.

883
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That was very wholesome.

884
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's a great reply from Arnie.

885
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's so true.

886
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The only good Republican.

887
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, I don't know too much about his political governorship.

888
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But I've always seen things he said as like,

889
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
oh yeah, you know, that's pretty good.

890
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You're not just a meathead.

891
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Maybe he's also that.

892
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, I don't know the details.

893
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I saw during the height of COVID, he was like pro-mask and stuff.

894
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So he did that.

895
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He made that post with the sword of Conan to be,

896
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I think it was something to do with how we should all wear a mask or something like that.

897
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

898
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
He seems okay.

899
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
He's probably legislated some horrible stuff.

900
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
He's probably pushed some horrible fucking nightmare shit in Congress.

901
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Oh yeah, sure.

902
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh wait, he's not a Congresswoman, a governor or whatever.

903
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He's probably vetoed some really cool shit, but oh well.

904
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I remember this thing he did, because he's really popular in Russia.

905
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
He made a video to the people of Russia condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine

906
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and talking at it in a sort of even moderate tone so that he could get through to them.

907
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And it was like, yeah, that's nice.

908
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's nice that you're trying to use your celebrity status to invoke change,

909
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
or at least change minds or open people to newer ideas.

910
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
He's saying the Russian media is lying to you and he's like, yeah.

911
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's a good post, Arnold.

912
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yeah.

913
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
He's a Republican though.

914
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's fucked up.

915
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Some weirds going on there.

916
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Maybe he just has a few backwards beliefs and they technically make him a Republican,

917
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
but he's not evil spawn.

918
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I mean, it must just be that that's who votes for him.

919
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's where he could get the votes.

920
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Maybe.

921
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't know.

922
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's a mystery.

923
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's like that sometimes a person is like a cool person.

924
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
They just happen to be pro-gun and then they only get Republican votes.

925
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah.

926
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's like guns aren't that, I mean, they're bad regulation and all that,

927
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but like guns are just things.

928
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Like saying get rid of all guns is, I don't know.

929
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah.

930
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Doesn't make you like an insane person to like guns.

931
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like the official Republican platform is like criminalized gay marriage,

932
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
set up the police state, et cetera, et cetera.

933
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Prevent trans people of any age from getting healthcare.

934
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Goes without saying.

935
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I guess maybe they're all not 100% the same.

936
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
No.

937
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I wouldn't ever expect it, but like, I don't know.

938
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't know his views.

939
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I just know that he makes holes.

940
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
He's wholesome and he gives good workout advice.

941
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And for me that, and that gets in my vote.

942
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And what he, and what he does to trans people after he's elected is their problem.

943
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah.

944
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Hell yeah.

945
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It'd be really funny if he was pro-trans.

946
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Like all of these things just pile up.

947
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It's like, how is he Republican?

948
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Like what, huh?

949
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah.

950
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Maybe.

951
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I don't know.

952
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It feels like the sort of open-minded guy who would be like at least,

953
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
at the very least like lukewarm and not like anti-trans.

954
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That's my, yeah, I would think so.

955
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I mean, he's, he's a Hollywood star.

956
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
He's like straight out of the mouth of Mammon.

957
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Like the satanic cult of like the Hollywood liberal elite is like where he came from.

958
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So he must have been infected.

959
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
He must have been infected with liberalism at some point.

960
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And it's eroding our national institutions from the inside out.

961
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Anyway, I don't know.

962
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The point is that's me.

963
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
That's me with making videos and going to the dentist and finding a new apartment.

964
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You're beating yourself up.

965
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And finishing my stupid book.

966
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
You're beating yourself up.

967
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm always beating myself up.

968
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm always beating myself up.

969
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Sometimes you gotta accept you can't do everything.

970
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm always beating myself up.

971
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I try to, I'm always beating myself up.

972
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And I'm always, I feel like I'm always in the like, God, I haven't,

973
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I haven't done it.

974
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I haven't done anything.

975
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I haven't produced content.

976
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
What am I going to, I'm going to go to hell now.

977
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Well, I feel like I'm always in the, I haven't produced anything,

978
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
but I have to do something like just let me just baby steps.

979
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Like let me just do something.

980
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like let me do something today.

981
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And then I'll like, you know, maybe write up like another,

982
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
another page of the notes or whatever, or I'll, or I'll go and,

983
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
or I'll go and I'll do the, and it's like, yeah, I did something,

984
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
but like I should really do more.

985
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
No, that's, that's part of the, that's part of the wrong mindset.

986
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You should be, you should be happy.

987
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You should be doing less.

988
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You should be a forgiveful of your own, I don't know,

989
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
what do we call it?

990
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Not reaching a certain standard.

991
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If you don't reach it, just forgive yourself.

992
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's a good thing to try.

993
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Speaking of, speaking of things that I did just to get them done

994
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
and feel like I accomplished something.

995
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Uh, I forgot, I should have mentioned this first thing.

996
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
The podcast episodes are up on the apps.

997
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
They are up on the various apps, Google, Google podcasts,

998
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Apple podcasts, Spotify, and on the website,

999
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
the procrastinatorspodcast.com.

1000
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Unbelievable.

1001
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah.

1002
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I finally, I finally figured it out.

1003
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Good job.

1004
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Um, okay.

1005
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And then just today, someone messaged me just today.

1006
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Okay.

1007
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Apparently Spotify is now missing episodes one through 13.

1008
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Someone, two people have reported to me that since uploading

1009
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the new episodes, it's as though it hit a 300 episode limit

1010
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and then like removed the first few.

1011
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And that is infuriating.

1012
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's not on every platform.

1013
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Like it's like the website still has all of them.

1014
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But I don't know.

1015
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't use Spotify and I don't look at the podcast apps.

1016
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I just, I just post them all through WordPress.

1017
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So I can't, I don't know.

1018
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I don't know.

1019
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I guess we should try to fix that.

1020
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I guess.

1021
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah.

1022
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's not, if it's not one fucking thing, it's another.

1023
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

1024
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean, at least it's up on lots of things.

1025
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
At least people can shut up about it.

1026
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Well, more or less.

1027
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

1028
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I feel, man, I feel like, I feel a little bit like I've been gaslit.

1029
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Like I would, like it felt like, it felt like lots of people were asking me,

1030
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Hey, put them on the podcast apps, put them on the apps.

1031
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And then now that they're up, like, like three people are like, Oh, cool.

1032
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Thanks.

1033
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's that classic, like the, the, the people who squeaky wheel gets the oil.

1034
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
They only speak when they have something to complain about.

1035
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And otherwise they're just content and silent.

1036
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You have no idea whether they, they enjoy what's happening.

1037
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah.

1038
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I really don't.

1039
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Hopefully, I mean the, yeah, I went and I checked just a minute ago and episodes one through 13 are still on the website.

1040
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Maybe they can be restored to, maybe they're just being hidden on Spotify.

1041
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
They're not like, they're not gone.

1042
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:41,000
They might, they might be gone from that particular app, which is fucking obnoxious.

1043
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Well, that would mean that there are 301.

1044
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh God, I guess I'll have to fucking figure out, make a Spotify account or something.

1045
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Maybe.

1046
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I mean, we don't have to, we don't have to pay for that.

1047
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
To, I mean, isn't it, isn't that already an account that these PCP episodes are on?

1048
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't, I don't know because I didn't use an account.

1049
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's like when you, when you post it to WordPress, I think Tom set it up so that you can check a box.

1050
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And if the box is checked, it will like automatically also upload them on the other, the other apps.

1051
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I didn't engage with anything outside of WordPress.

1052
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I guess we just have to look and see where they are from a user's perspective.

1053
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
See that account.

1054
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I guess you could always like, like badger Tom about some, some glitch that's happening.

1055
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I feel confident that he will just tell me he doesn't know.

1056
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah.

1057
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I mean, I could, I could, I could ask him.

1058
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:58,000
If it's not immediately obvious from looking it up, then I guess you're worth, worth asking.

1059
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Okay.

1060
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I Googled, maybe I'm doing this wrong.

1061
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I Googled Spotify, the procrastinators.

1062
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And I looked at open.spotify.com.

1063
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Slash are like, there's one called the procrastinators, but all it has is the, the garling house track.

1064
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
There's no podcast episodes.

1065
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
What is this?

1066
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I guess that's like the account Nate made to post that as like the song that is what we made.

1067
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I mean, wait a minute.

1068
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm seeing that there is in fact another podcast on Spotify called the procrastinators.

1069
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
One word.

1070
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So there's another show that stole our name.

1071
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Okay.

1072
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Here we go.

1073
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Here we go.

1074
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And this is, I know what I'm going to see.

1075
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm scrolling down, scrolling down, and I'm going to see that episodes one through 13 are missing.

1076
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So I don't, I don't, I don't know what, but I don't know what to do about it.

1077
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Maybe I'll just have to log into the Spotify account.

1078
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Maybe it's like, there's like an account thing being like, oh, these ones were blocked.

1079
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You have to like confirm that they're stupid or not.

1080
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And then we can put them back up.

1081
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Like they're unlisted or some, some sort of thing you have to do in the account settings.

1082
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I hope so.

1083
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I hope I don't just have to fucking repost them.

1084
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
That would be annoying.

1085
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Whatever.

1086
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:47,000
If for some reason you wanted to immediately, someone wanted to immediately go back and listen to episodes one through 13 of the PCP.

1087
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Well, you can no, you cannot do that on Spotify at the moment.

1088
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You would have to do it on a different app.

1089
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh well.

1090
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Get fuck spot if fires.

1091
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I guess I'll have to.

1092
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I thought I was done.

1093
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I thought I was done dealing with it.

1094
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm going to get upset.

1095
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'm going to get upset thinking about it.

1096
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I just, I don't want to, I don't want to do it anymore.

1097
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I don't want to, I don't care.

1098
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I don't care about this shit.

1099
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Well, you don't.

1100
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I mean, it's the, like you said, it's just the first 13 on Spotify specifically.

1101
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I think you can leave that for a while.

1102
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But it will continue to be every episode.

1103
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
This is going to keep happening.

1104
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh, is it every episode?

1105
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah.

1106
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Clearly what happened is that by like posting the new episodes, it erased the old ones.

1107
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh, is that?

1108
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, so like there's a maximum amount of things you can have on a podcast?

1109
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I don't know.

1110
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I mean, that seems, seems, seems that way.

1111
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh, so you posted 13 things and it's like deleted the first 13.

1112
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That's what people are telling me.

1113
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Huh.

1114
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Must be so, maybe it's a Spotify premium, something or other.

1115
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I feel like that 300 something episodes is a lot.

1116
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Sure is.

1117
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Well, if it's, if it's one through 13, then there's four.

1118
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yeah, there are 301 episodes live.

1119
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
There's, there's episodes 14 through 314.

1120
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
That's 301 episodes.

1121
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Why would the limit be 301?

1122
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
What's going on here?

1123
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I don't know.

1124
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay.

1125
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, I guess let's change the subject because I don't, I'm not going to, we're not going

1126
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
to solve this by yammering about it.

1127
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yeah.

1128
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Um, I guess, uh, I could talk about that I got a cool hat in America.

1129
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yeah.

1130
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I got a cool sun hat.

1131
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Oh, you posted a picture of yourself.

1132
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Oh, I did.

1133
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
For like the first time in a long time, I think, right?

1134
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yes.

1135
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I had not shown my face since, uh, any Radcon 4 content actually.

1136
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I had not seen your face since Radcon 4 in any capacity at all.

1137
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And, uh, yeah, people said, said that I looked cute and that was very nice.

1138
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It was a nice picture.

1139
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It looked pretty good.

1140
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Uh, I was excited, I was just excited to see that you were posting your face and I thought

1141
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
that was cool.

1142
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Thanks.

1143
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Thought about, about time, I guess.

1144
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I guess I don't post my face much either, but nobody cares what I look like.

1145
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So it's fine.

1146
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Uh, I look the same as always.

1147
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I hope I'm actually not sure if that's true.

1148
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Actually, no, I look old now.

1149
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
My beard, I have more gray in my beard than I used to.

1150
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I did see, I just see your gray bits.

1151
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Oh, great.

1152
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, I love that.

1153
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Oh, thanks.

1154
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Oh, thanks for telling me.

1155
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I appreciate it.

1156
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
You're supposed to lie.

1157
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
You're supposed to tell me the lie that I want to hear.

1158
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
No, it's not true.

1159
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Anything.

1160
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
No, no, no.

1161
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And you look, I didn't say you look old.

1162
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I just said I noticed the gray hairs.

1163
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You don't look like you're, you're, you're hobbling along.

1164
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You look good.

1165
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh, thanks.

1166
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Uh, I guess there's worse, I guess there's worse things.

1167
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
There's worse things than gray in your beard, I suppose.

1168
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah.

1169
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Whatever.

1170
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's fine.

1171
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's fine.

1172
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Uh, my teeth, my teeth look terrible.

1173
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Uh, my, my, my, uh, my hairline is gone.

1174
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
My beard is gray.

1175
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm, uh, uh, I'm dead.

1176
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No, it's like a salt and pepper or whatever they say.

1177
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh, sure.

1178
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah.

1179
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It's cool.

1180
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It's a cool look.

1181
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
No, don't patronize me.

1182
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
No, I kind of like it.

1183
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't know.

1184
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Nothing.

1185
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I appreciate it.

1186
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Very nice.

1187
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's okay.

1188
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's okay.

1189
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I was, um, damn, I had a moment.

1190
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Oh, shit.

1191
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
My headphone jack came out.

1192
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I said I was fucking around with my webcam.

1193
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And boy, I turned on my webcam and I got, I got the most disgusting, like, unflattering

1194
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
angle of myself imaginable.

1195
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And I was like, I was like, Oh God, no God, why Jesus?

1196
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Are you there by the way?

1197
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah, I'm here.

1198
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, I don't know what, to what you're referring.

1199
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I don't know if I saw that.

1200
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
No, no, no.

1201
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I just, I saw myself in the feed from my webcam.

1202
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Oh.

1203
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I didn't take a picture.

1204
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And it was, it was very bad.

1205
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Um, that was where I saw my, I thought my teeth looked messed up and I thought I need to go

1206
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
to the dentist.

1207
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Um, but I don't know.

1208
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Then I, then I switched to the front camera on my regular phone.

1209
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I was like, no, I look normal.

1210
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
No, I look normal.

1211
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's fine.

1212
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's fine, actually.

1213
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Uh, okay, okay.

1214
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't, I, I mean, you look good to me.

1215
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
It's time for my weekly existential crisis.

1216
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's time for my weak, weakly fucking therapy session about like, Oh God, I'm getting old.

1217
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I don't like my face anymore.

1218
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Hey, Ben, what do you think your skeleton looks like?

1219
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It looks bad.

1220
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It sucks.

1221
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
My skeleton's so fucking old.

1222
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
No, I'm going to make an ugly skeleton when I die.

1223
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I'm going to leave behind a shitty skeleton and that's the worst.

1224
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
People are going to dig up my bones and they're going to laugh out loud.

1225
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
They're going to fall over.

1226
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
The aliens are going to dig them up and be like, ew, look at this one.

1227
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Oh, what was he thinking?

1228
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Um, what was he thinking growing his skeleton like this?

1229
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Wait, that reminds me of something.

1230
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
What does that remind me of?

1231
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
What is the idea of like growing your skeleton?

1232
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Remind me of.

1233
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Uh, drinking milk?

1234
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:22,000
No, like, did I watch a video about like a horror game recently or something?

1235
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
About like bloody skeletons or something?

1236
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I don't know.

1237
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Maybe I had a dream that I like don't really remember.

1238
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't know.

1239
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
They just triggered like a moment of like.

1240
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You had a dream where you were looking at your own skeleton and you were like trying to do dark magic to make it look like the Chad face.

1241
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
You know that the slow moving grayscale Chad guy?

1242
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1243
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
The guy who is based on the new Pokemon professor.

1244
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah.

1246
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You got the funny jaw on the, the, the shaved side of head.

1247
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He does.

1248
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They made the new, they made the new professor look like the giga chair.

1249
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You see the, the, I don't know whether this is real actually, but did you see the female trainer, female scientists, Pokemon professor, like vampire fangs?

1250
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yeah.

1251
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
She's got like sharp incisors or whatever that called.

1252
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Yeah, yeah, I did see that.

1253
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
She looks like a wild, wild lady or something.

1254
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I don't know.

1255
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
She looks like a tribal, crazy beast tamer or something.

1256
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I don't, a huntress.

1257
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm not, I don't know how to describe.

1258
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
She'll bite you.

1259
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
She'll, oh, she'll bite you.

1260
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That we can all agree she'll bite you.

1261
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I heard that sprigatito stands on its hind legs and that sucks.

1262
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean, don't most Pokemon end up doing that?

1263
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yes, but it's bad when they do, when they do it with like Meowth and they make, they make us, they take a fucking cat and they make its, I think they did it with Litten.

1264
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm not sure if they did it with Litten, but they did it with Perloin.

1265
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
They've done it with a bunch of fucking cats, like instead of just letting them stand like a cat, they make them stand on their hind legs like idiots.

1266
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It sucks.

1267
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
There's Persian that doesn't do that.

1268
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Persian doesn't do it.

1269
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yeah, I guess it is usually like Incineroar is the most obvious like annoying example of a cat that got ruined.

1270
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
They got humanized too much.

1271
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I mean, he's not even really a cat anymore.

1272
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Well, obviously that's why it's so upsetting.

1273
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Like cat, Litten, and then Torracat look cool.

1274
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And then Incineroar, like nobody remembers Torracat.

1275
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I think I made a tweet about it.

1276
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I didn't even remember his name.

1277
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Google Torracat and it'd be like, oh, that's a cool.

1278
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I wonder what's next.

1279
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Just like, no.

1280
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:04,000
No, with the switch to 3D models, with the switch to 3D models, they just made a bunch of, like the old sprites used to have them on four.

1281
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And now they stand, it's Meowth they did it with.

1282
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I think, no, not Glameow, but definitely Perloin.

1283
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I feel like Meowth standing is mostly because of the TV show, right?

1284
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Meowth being a famous stand, like he's specifically a Meowth that stands and talks like a human.

1285
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Meowth default does that, which is odd.

1286
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I could sort of understand it because that's the image most people have of Meowth.

1287
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I wouldn't like it, but I would understand it.

1288
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I don't understand having Perloin stand on its hind legs, like that's nonsense.

1289
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Well, how else are you going to have sex with it?

1290
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It's not fully evolved, Gib.

1291
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's immature.

1292
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You can't have sex.

1293
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I press the B button.

1294
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
They press the B button every, like, they're actually much older.

1295
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:06,000
If your waifu is competitive in Little Cup, then I'm sorry, but you're going to jail.

1296
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
No one in Little Cup.

1297
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
No, I press the B button.

1298
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I press the B button.

1299
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
No, you can't, listen, you can't have sex with an onyx.

1300
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's a baby.

1301
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:21,000
That's a baby because it needs to evolve into mega, mega steelics before you can fuck it.

1302
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
God, does onyx have internal organs?

1303
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
How do they connect?

1304
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Like, if you break it in half, does it bleed?

1305
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Yeah, I guess I've always thought of the body as just like a series of rocks and he eats a rock

1306
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
and he's like a snake.

1307
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
He's like the snake from Snake.

1308
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
He eats a small rock or a big rock and it becomes his next segment.

1309
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But I've never really considered what happens if you just get rid of all the other rocks.

1310
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Is he just a head?

1311
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I feel like, no, I could be wrong, but I feel like I have a hazy sort of memory or a feeling

1312
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that the Pokedex entries describing rock type Pokemon pretty much imply that, like, they're not really made of rocks.

1313
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:18,000
They're just kind of, like, have skin that, like, looks like and feels like and is similarly hard like rocks.

1314
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Like, he's still an organic creature, I think.

1315
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I feel like they eat rocks, though.

1316
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I guess, well, I don't know if things can eat rocks.

1317
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
There's not much nutrients and they're hard to digest.

1318
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
But, like, in a fantasy world, I guess you could say they just do that and they also have lungs somewhere.

1319
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
But that means Onyx has a butthole at the end.

1320
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah, he eats rocks and then he eats, well, here's what he does, right?

1321
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Here's how it works.

1322
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
He eats, like, rocks and gravel.

1323
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Like, he takes big bites of, like, loose rock and then he, like, digested and processes it into one, like, big, solid rock poop

1324
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
and then he poops it out the end of his tail and it attaches it to the end of him.

1325
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And that's how he gets longer.

1326
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yeah, he's just made of his own shit, that's right.

1327
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's just the most likely explanation.

1328
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I guess somebody's got to do it.

1329
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It's a living.

1330
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But wait, where does the butthole go? Does the butthole stay and then it's just poop from there?

1331
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Does he have a butthole at the end, the other side of his head? Like, where is his stomach?

1332
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
He actually, every individual boulder that composes him has its own stomach.

1333
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And its own butthole?

1334
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And its own butthole, yes. That connects to the next segment, human centipede style.

1335
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Oh, and that would explain why they get smaller, because, like, as they go through more and more stomachs, they get smaller and smaller, like, dissolved or, like, chipped away.

1336
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Actually, each segment of an onyx is actually its own little geodude that's, like, just been human centipeded together.

1337
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Wow, well, it makes too much sense.

1338
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's why they all live together in Mt. Moon, or whatever.

1339
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Do onyx live in Mt. Moon?

1340
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Yeah, very rare to find them, but they do.

1341
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Well, actually, I don't know.

1342
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
We've learned a lot about it.

1343
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They must be catchable, because I remember.

1344
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I think they might be a different case.

1345
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I know the hikers have them.

1346
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
There's a tunnel called Rock Tunnel.

1347
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
There is, I think, in Gen 1, yeah. Or, like, Diglet Cave.

1348
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't know if Onyx is living in Diglet Cave.

1349
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,000
There's a tunnel where it's dark, and you have to use Flash or something.

1350
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That's...

1351
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's later.

1352
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That's after, like, the place where you can go north through the water to get to the power plant.

1353
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Isn't Diglet Cave in Kanto?

1354
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
No, Joto. I meant to say Joto.

1355
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Isn't Diglet Cave in Gen 2?

1356
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It's in Kanto. It's like a shortcut you can take.

1357
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
That's where you find Diglet and Dugtrio a lot, obviously.

1358
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
What?

1359
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I just want to be it.

1360
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I know there's a different...

1361
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I think there's a sort of Diglet Tunnel in Gen 7.

1362
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
There's a different sort of tunnel in Gen 2.

1363
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I don't know.

1364
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
You know, I still have not...

1365
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I've had my new phone for a long time, and I still have not started playing Pokemon Go again.

1366
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I was playing it a lot.

1367
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I was playing Pokemon Go...

1368
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I mostly saw you all playing Pikmin Bloom.

1369
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Pikmin Bloom, yeah. I introduced Pikmin Bloom.

1370
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I think so. And then I got people hooked on it.

1371
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And now, like, a lot of people are playing it, which is fun.

1372
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I was surprised to seem like a bunch of you were doing it.

1373
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah, it's just because, like, as we were there, we were walking around.

1374
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
We were going on days out.

1375
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
There was a lot of walking happening.

1376
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
We didn't want to look at our phones playing Pokemon the whole time,

1377
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
and Pokemon was kind of boring, honestly.

1378
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Yeah, that would be lame.

1379
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Every time we go for a walk, we set the flowers blooming,

1380
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and we put our phones away and we just hang out.

1381
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah.

1382
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I was playing a bit of Pokemon Go during the COVID week

1383
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
because I was bored to death of looking at YouTube videos.

1384
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I'm like...

1385
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I'm sure.

1386
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
There's a poker stop in view, not in range,

1387
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
so I could get items and I could throw pokeballs.

1388
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It was like, I guess I'm just going to collect some stuff.

1389
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I don't know.

1390
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But then, because of that, I'm like,

1391
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
oh, look at all these tasks that have built up over the years of me not playing this.

1392
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Man, I could do some of that.

1393
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I could catch 20 psychic Pokemon.

1394
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Come on.

1395
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Easily.

1396
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Come on, get another psychic Pokemon.

1397
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Yeah.

1398
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Now I'm playing Pokemon Go again.

1399
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I had stopped playing because it's boring,

1400
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
but now it's not boring, and I like it.

1401
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Because you can walk around again?

1402
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
No, because I was playing it during COVID,

1403
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and I was like, oh, I just got hooked on stat going up and getting things,

1404
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
and oh, look at...

1405
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
What if I catch every Pokemon I see?

1406
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Think of all the Stardust I'll get.

1407
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You know, like stupid shit like that.

1408
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So I'm just...

1409
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm playing it now.

1410
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Well, not now, but like...

1411
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Next time I go for a walk, I'm going to do both at once.

1412
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I'm going to put on my flowers on Pikmin Bloom,

1413
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
switch to Pokemon, catch everything I can,

1414
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
and then reap the benefits of my...

1415
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Look at my phone all the time.

1416
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Mmm, the massive benefits.

1417
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Pokemon or Pikmin Bloom looked pretty neat.

1418
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah.

1419
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Sending your guys out on like a long journey.

1420
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Like, didn't you...

1421
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You sent one...

1422
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You sent like a...

1423
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I sent a troop.

1424
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
An envoy like back to the UK, right?

1425
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
When I got to America, I was showing people...

1427
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
We were sitting in the chicken place.

1428
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes.

1429
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
An underdog chicken.

1430
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I can't remember...

1431
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I mean, I do remember, but that was so long ago.

1432
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
What the fuck?

1433
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I remember watching you send that thing.

1434
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We got the...

1435
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
We got the...

1436
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
We got the...

1437
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
What's that?

1438
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Cale slaw.

1439
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
The Cale slaw and underdog chicken.

1440
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I think that's what you got.

1441
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I got like just the chicken wings.

1442
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1443
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Yeah, I was showing people Pikmin Bloom,

1444
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
and there was an expedition in the UK

1445
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
since I had been at the airport.

1446
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It was like, you know, it takes a few hours,

1447
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
a few...

1448
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Like maybe a day or so before something

1449
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
that you can go on an expedition for

1450
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
decides to not be there anymore.

1451
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But I could do it.

1452
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So I sent them on a journey

1453
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
across the Atlantic,

1454
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and it took them 25 days.

1455
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Or I said it was going to take them like 25 days.

1456
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I think when I flew over them back,

1457
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I intercepted them,

1458
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
and then it sort of went to zero,

1459
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and I got their thing.

1460
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So that's pretty funny.

1461
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Huh.

1462
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You just picked them up over the Atlantic?

1463
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Yeah.

1464
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
They were like swimming over it with the thing

1465
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that they had.

1466
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
They were rafts.

1467
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They picked it up.

1468
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
They'd gone all the way over.

1469
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Picked it up, and then it was...

1470
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
They had to walk all the way back,

1471
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and I scooped them up out of the water

1472
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
as we were flying over them.

1473
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Nice.

1474
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But now,

1475
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I've got so many Pikmin from Boston.

1476
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
When you do things with a Pikmin,

1477
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
your friendship level with that particular Pikmin

1478
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
will go up,

1479
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
and when it gets to the maximum level,

1480
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
you send them on an expedition

1481
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
all by themselves

1482
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
back to the location of where you found them

1483
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
so that they can pick up

1484
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
like a cosmetic item based on the location.

1485
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So like if you found them at a movie theater,

1486
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
they might come back

1487
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and then they'd be wearing like a popcorn thing

1488
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
on their head or something,

1489
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
which is cute.

1490
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
And I got a lot of Pikmin from Boston,

1491
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
so eventually I'll be sending like,

1492
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I don't know, 40 little people

1493
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
across the ocean,

1494
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
and they're going to take a long time

1495
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
getting there and getting back.

1496
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Will it be another 25-day journey?

1497
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I think so.

1498
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Like 25-day journey for each person.

1499
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
That's delightful.

1500
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah.

1501
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Sweet.

1502
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Yeah, I just...

1503
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
noticed you and a bunch of people

1504
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
blooming.

1505
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
We're bloomers.

1506
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
We're bloomers.

1507
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I should have bloomed.

1508
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Maybe I should have bloomed.

1509
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh well.

1510
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Too late now.

1511
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'll just... I'll just bloom instead.

1512
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I'll just never bloom.

1513
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'll just never...

1514
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You know what? Fuck it.

1515
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
You know, I'm already late.

1516
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm already late.

1517
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Why bother blooming at all?

1518
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Uh, I mean...

1519
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Yeah.

1520
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Never do it.

1521
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
True!

1522
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's why I've never bloomed.

1523
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I've always liked it just because it's like...

1524
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
it's a soft incentive to walk more.

1525
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Pokemon Go feels very easy.

1526
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
That's why I used to like...

1527
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Pokemon Go.

1528
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Pokemon Go is very easy to be like,

1529
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
well, I've done so much,

1530
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
but like, if I want the next like,

1531
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
progression thing,

1532
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I need to be very lucky with the Pokemon that spawn

1533
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and I don't feel like walking to...

1534
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
for so long to find that one Pokemon I need.

1535
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
It's like, you know what? Fuck it.

1536
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm just gonna find a Pokemon if I find it at a place.

1537
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But Pikmin Bloom,

1538
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
progression...

1539
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
the main thing is walking.

1540
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Everything is to do with how much you walk.

1541
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So it's like, the incentive to go on a walk

1542
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
is a little higher.

1543
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And the stakes are so low.

1544
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And like, the things you can get are so...

1545
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
like, basic.

1546
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It's not like anything is super rare.

1547
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
If you want a Pikmin that has like a cosmetic

1548
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
of like a barbershop thing,

1549
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
which I've got a few of those,

1550
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
like a comb on the back of it,

1551
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
like a little yellow Pikmin or scissors.

1552
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Get it like a pick, like a pick sticking out of an afro?

1553
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
A what?

1554
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You know, like a hair pick,

1555
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
like stuck in an afro.

1556
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Yeah.

1557
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That's what I would want if I had a barbershop...

1558
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
a pro barbershop Pikmin.

1559
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And so like, if you want to get one of those,

1560
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
you just go to barbershops and walk around,

1561
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and then maybe you'll find like a seedling.

1562
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
You can grab that.

1563
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And then when they're like fully friendshiped,

1564
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
they'll...

1565
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
you can send them back, they'll have one.

1566
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And it's sort of like, there's no...

1567
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
there's much less random chance

1568
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
than there is in Pokemon Go

1569
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
for you to be disappointed on a day out.

1570
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
You're always making progress by playing Pikmin Go,

1571
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
just...

1572
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
even if you don't turn on the app,

1573
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
it'll like count if you have your phone on you.

1574
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And it's like, even in standby mode,

1575
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
it'll be counting your steps through the Google Fit thing,

1576
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
using the gyroscope or whatever.

1577
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So it'll be like,

1578
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
you turn it on for the first time in like a few weeks,

1579
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
if you've just been moving around and said,

1580
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
you've walked like a million steps.

1581
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
See how many levels you get.

1582
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And it's like, it's good.

1583
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It's low effort, low investment,

1584
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
and very cute.

1585
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
What I... yeah.

1586
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
What I used to like about Pokemon Go

1587
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
was that it got me walking around a lot,

1588
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
like when I used to...

1589
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
a couple years ago when I used to play it,

1590
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I was like...

1591
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
that was when I lost a bunch of weight.

1592
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Part of the reason was because I was just walking like all the time,

1593
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
looking for Pokemon.

1594
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And boy, did I ever find them.

1595
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Uh...

1596
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah.

1597
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I don't know. Pretty cool.

1598
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Pretty fun. Pretty cute.

1599
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Okay, well, next episode...

1600
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Beth, the end of the episode of the podcast.

1601
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Well, Ben, what about the voicemails?

1602
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Are there like a hundred thousand voicemails?

1603
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
There are...

1604
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
There are...

1605
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
about double the normal amount of voicemails.

1606
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I looked...

1607
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Okay.

1608
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
So it's not as...

1609
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Yeah.

1610
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah, I mean, we could just start,

1611
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and I'm sure we'll think of things to...

1612
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I was gonna say it's only been an hour and a half,

1613
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
and I feel like after such a long absence,

1614
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
surely there must be more to go over.

1615
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But we can think of those...

1616
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
The only things I would talk about

1617
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
would be like specifics of what I did,

1618
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
which is just like talking about a holiday like,

1619
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
oh, and then we went to the thing and we saw this,

1620
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
and then we did that.

1621
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Oh, you know what?

1622
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Here's one thing.

1623
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I got high.

1624
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I got like proper high.

1625
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
No!

1626
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yes, I'm corrupted.

1627
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
If you want to talk about this, you had smoked...

1628
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Correct me.

1629
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Did you smoke for the first time at Radcon 4?

1630
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I think...

1631
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I think I had smoked like a tiny bit in Radcon 3,

1632
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and I didn't get high,

1633
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and then it was like said like,

1634
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
oh, well, maybe it doesn't happen the first time.

1635
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The second time, though.

1636
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
But I didn't end up smoking a second time at Radcon 3.

1637
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I just didn't feel like it.

1638
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
At Radcon 4, I was like,

1639
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
this time I'm going to get high,

1640
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and I smoked on that like stupid video

1641
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
where it was like all green.

1642
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I think that's still up somewhere on the PCP channel.

1643
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Sounds vaguely familiar.

1644
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

1645
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I don't remember the content of the video.

1646
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It was just like whatever, we're smoking,

1647
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and Trixie was talking about how she does bongs stuff,

1648
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
and I was just being like,

1649
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I sure hope I get high.

1650
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I went outside, and it was sort of dark,

1651
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and I remember feeling a bit funny.

1652
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I remember being like, whoa,

1653
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
this is kind of, whoa,

1654
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
the sand dunes are moving a little.

1655
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I could feel myself being a little odd,

1656
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
but not like I did this time.

1657
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Nowhere near.

1658
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You smoked before,

1659
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
but you took edibles this time.

1660
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yes.

1661
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I took edibles, and I had a bit,

1662
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I had a bit one night, and I didn't feel enough.

1663
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Everyone was losing their minds,

1664
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
and I didn't feel like I was losing enough of my mind

1665
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
for it to be worth it.

1666
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So the next time I took a little,

1667
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I took like a lot,

1668
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
not like more than was,

1669
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I think I took exactly the same amount I took last time

1670
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
when I didn't feel so high,

1671
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
but I was still kind of giggly.

1672
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I took that amount, but like all at once.

1673
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So before it was like spread out

1674
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
over the course of a few hours,

1675
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
this time I took the maximum amount that I took,

1676
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
same amount all at once,

1677
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and it hit a lot harder.

1678
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And I think also I was a bit like,

1679
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I hadn't eaten that much that day,

1680
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
so it went straight into my system.

1681
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I have had the experience before of eating an edible

1682
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
and thinking it didn't work,

1683
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
and then it hits me like way too hard.

1684
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
That has happened to me before.

1685
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Now I had a really funny time.

1686
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It was like the most hilarious thing in the world,

1687
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and I hadn't experienced like time dilation before.

1688
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
So I was like very confused,

1689
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
but like laughing about how confusing it was.

1690
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You mean thinking that like,

1691
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
thinking it's been like half an hour,

1692
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
but it's been like two minutes?

1693
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It was a weird experience,

1694
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
because it's not like anything felt slower.

1695
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It was just like the gaps in between things that were happening.

1696
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Like retroactively felt like they had taken extremely long time.

1697
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Like a gap in a sentence.

1698
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Somebody would say something,

1699
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and there would be a pause

1700
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
before somebody says something else,

1701
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
and the pause would always feel like it went on far too long

1702
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
for it to not be incredibly awkward.

1703
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And I would laugh at the fact that it was so awkward

1704
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
when from other people's perspectives

1705
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
it would sound completely fine,

1706
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
except I laughed in the middle.

1707
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I know what you mean.

1708
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I hate that feeling.

1709
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I don't like it at all.

1710
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I, you know, it does get a little much.

1711
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I was like, but I think it was because it was my first time

1712
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
getting that high.

1713
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It was just like such a new experience.

1714
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I was so excited that it was working.

1715
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'm like, I wanted people to understand that I got it.

1716
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
And I tried to explain it a lot.

1717
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's hard to explain a feeling like that.

1718
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I think, I think, I put an explanation somewhere.

1719
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Let me see if I can find.

1720
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
You wrote it in the discord group.

1721
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Yes, yes, that's it.

1722
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So this is how I described it.

1723
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Day after.

1724
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Before I forget, the experience is like two aspects

1725
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
of my consciousness are experiencing time differently.

1726
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Like, I know what it feels like to move my arm at X speed,

1727
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
but the feedback I'm getting says that I'm going at some other speed.

1728
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Thus, there is a contradiction of experience

1729
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and due to confusion, I can only laugh about it.

1730
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So yeah, that's, and then I do a little quote like,

1731
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
what do you mean it took one second?

1732
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's been ages, XD.

1733
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
XD.

1734
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And that's how it felt.

1735
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I think it's basically what happens.

1736
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It's like, I'm expecting some amount of like stimulus,

1737
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
like visual and audio feedback and touch feedback

1738
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
for the things that I know I'm physically doing

1739
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and the fact that it takes much longer is like,

1740
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
what's going on?

1741
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Like I'm just confused at everything happening.

1742
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
But like, it was funny confusion.

1743
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
It sounds about in line with my experience,

1744
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
except that I find that sensation really stressful.

1745
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And I don't like it.

1746
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It stresses me out.

1747
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It makes me worry.

1748
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Well, I did feel a little stressed the next day

1749
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
because I was so high that I stayed high

1750
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
for basically the entirety of the day afterwards.

1751
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So we got high like in the evening to watch like funny videos.

1752
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I thought it took hours.

1753
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Apparently I had passed out in like 15 minutes

1754
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
or like 20 minutes or something,

1755
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
which is the negative of time dilation

1756
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
is that I kind of ruined the night for everyone else

1757
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
because I had like a million years of experience

1758
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
in like 10 seconds and then I passed out

1759
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
and everyone was like, oh, well, I guess we're going to sleep.

1760
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
But I was high the next day.

1761
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Was that pre-COVID or post-COVID?

1762
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Fuck.

1763
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Oh, no, if that's the 6th of June.

1764
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Oh, that would have been post.

1765
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It would have been post.

1766
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Because you got COVID on the 23rd.

1767
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
23rd of May, yeah.

1768
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So I was high like for a lot of the next day.

1769
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So like people were busy and I was still high

1770
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and it was, you know, there was a whole day of like

1771
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
just try to like stay, like do something,

1772
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
just try to occupy your time.

1773
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It was weird because like obviously during the time I was high

1774
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
time was still dilating, but it was a normal day,

1775
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
which means that people were just going about their thing.

1776
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But for me, it felt like it was hours

1777
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
every time somebody left the room, not hours,

1778
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
but like a really long time, kind of uncomfortable

1779
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
to the point where I was like, do they hate me?

1780
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Are they leaving me alone for such a long time

1781
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
because they hate me?

1782
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Oh, no, I've ruined everything.

1783
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I was considering being like on Discord like,

1784
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
hey, if I've annoyed you, I'm really sorry.

1785
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And then I had to keep reminding myself,

1786
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I'm high right now.

1787
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Things are different.

1788
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

1789
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And you know, people were reassuring about it.

1790
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So it was fine.

1791
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I ended up taking a key and walking to a local park

1792
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and just sitting under a tree and just sort of sitting there.

1793
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And that felt like it took a really long time,

1794
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
but it was only like maybe an hour and 45 minutes.

1795
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Was it the one by the school,

1796
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
the park by the school that I'm thinking of?

1797
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I guess there's a school.

1798
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I don't know, it's a small little park.

1799
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I've heard that there's a park there

1800
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
and I've never gone to it.

1801
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So I'm not sure if I know the place you're talking about,

1802
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
but even though it's like right near my where I live, LaMalle.

1803
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I bumped the mic.

1804
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yeah, so I sat, I was just trying to like,

1805
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I don't know, like sweat it out of my body, I guess.

1806
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I just sort of waiting for it.

1807
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And obviously when time is dilating

1808
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and things take a long time from your perspective,

1809
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
waiting for anything to be over is like, it's too much.

1810
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
My patience ran thin.

1811
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Well, actually that was a weird thing.

1812
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I could experience, I felt like things were happening really slowly,

1813
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
but it was odd that my fatigue levels were not like increasing

1814
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
with the time that I thought was transpiring.

1815
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
You know what I mean?

1816
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Like I didn't feel more impatient or more fatigued

1817
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
as much as I thought I should be

1818
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
based on how I understand myself to be.

1819
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So I knew it was taking not so long.

1820
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
It felt like it was taking really long time,

1821
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
but I wasn't really bothered by it.

1822
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I was just sort of anxious and I knew that it would be like,

1823
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
oh God, how long am I going to be like this?

1824
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
This sucks when it's not like fun and communal

1825
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
and people are putting on funny YouTube videos to laugh at.

1826
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
When it's just me with my own thoughts, it's like fuck.

1827
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I don't like it. I don't like too much of it.

1828
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yeah, I understand.

1829
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Well, but we did get drunk that one time though.

1830
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That was a funny one as well.

1831
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
We did get drunk that one night and that was great.

1832
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I vaguely remember a lot of silly things were happening.

1833
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I had these funny fake, like huge boobies,

1834
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
these fake silicone breasts that I was like,

1835
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I brought because it would be funny,

1836
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
but I didn't have like the inkling to use them

1837
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
or pick them up or wear them at any point

1838
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
until I was drunk and I'm like...

1839
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Use them for what?

1840
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Use them for being worn.

1841
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I don't know.

1842
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I see, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1843
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
And that was like a drunk moment.

1844
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It was like, I got to do it.

1845
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Like inhibition is gone.

1846
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
But you mentioned them and everyone was like,

1847
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
yes, get them.

1848
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Put them on.

1849
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I put them on.

1850
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't remember who gave me the dress.

1851
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I was wearing a dress though.

1852
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I also don't remember.

1853
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I don't remember.

1854
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
It must have been Kazi, I guess.

1855
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I think they would be the most likely one

1856
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
to have a dress lying around to give you.

1857
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

1858
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Yeah, I got the dress.

1859
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I remember putting it on.

1860
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And I was on the floor a lot.

1861
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It was the sort of drunk where I'm like,

1862
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I know that I'm being silly

1863
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and I know I'm making fool of myself

1864
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and it's just amusing to myself.

1865
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Right, but it's okay.

1866
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Because so is everyone else.

1867
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Yeah, so everyone else.

1868
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And so it was like,

1869
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I was rolling around on the floor a lot

1870
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
or at least falling onto the floor

1871
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
but not like I'm accidentally falling.

1872
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
It's just like I realize now

1873
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that it is too difficult to stand upright

1874
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
and there's no problem.

1875
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Falling through glass tables.

1876
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, I get blood everywhere.

1877
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
No, I was like, okay,

1878
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
it'll be easier for me if I just accept

1879
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
that I can't stand up right now

1880
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and slowly lower myself onto the floor

1881
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and just crawl around a bit.

1882
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Among friends who have never done that.

1883
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
This will solve everything.

1884
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I just crawl around on the floor a little bit.

1885
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Right.

1886
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I like being like impaired.

1887
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
It's so fun.

1888
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, it's pretty base.

1889
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Yeah, I like drinking alcohol sometimes.

1890
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Whatever, yeah.

1891
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
So yeah, there was the drunk night.

1892
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
There was the weed night.

1893
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And there's, I don't know,

1894
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
we played video games.

1895
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Did you try, did they talk you into playing

1896
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Rivals of Aether?

1897
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
They did.

1898
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I played that for a bit.

1899
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I tried to play every character.

1900
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I can't play with those guys.

1901
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We're just not playing the same game.

1902
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Like, what do you mean?

1903
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
As in like, I can't play it on their level.

1904
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I mean, I managed to win one game.

1905
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I know this was like past the point

1906
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
where they were trying to teach me how to play

1907
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
easy on me.

1908
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I managed to win one game that was for player,

1909
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
mostly by staying out of people's way

1910
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
and then just having more stock than everyone else.

1911
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah, sometimes I can manage a win

1912
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
by like cheaply avoiding combat in a group battle scenario

1913
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
and letting the people that actually know how to play

1914
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
like whittle themselves down.

1915
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Even then, I freak, I freak,

1916
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I have won a couple games against Munchie

1917
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
and I'm convinced that every single time

1918
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
it's just because he's let me win.

1919
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I don't think if you were actually trying,

1920
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
there would even be a contest.

1921
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So I've given up.

1922
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I've given up playing those games over there.

1923
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I mean, the one thing I feel works

1924
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
when people know a game too well

1925
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
or well enough that they're high-ish level

1926
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
is when you suck so much at the basic...

1927
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
You just mash and just do random shit?

1928
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
You do random shit?

1929
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
You do things that they wouldn't expect coming

1930
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
because it would be inefficient or open myself up?

1931
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It's the sort of thing that's like,

1932
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
oh, I can get a few extra hits in

1933
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
because they didn't expect me to do that.

1934
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And sometimes I do well through that way.

1935
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Almost the time they beat me and it's like, yeah, whatever.

1936
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I only get mad at games like that

1937
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
when I feel like I performed badly for my own self.

1938
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
If I lose the match, that's expected.

1939
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
But if I fall off three times in a row...

1940
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's when you could have gotten back up.

1941
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
When I could have gotten back up

1942
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
and they weren't even edge guarding or anything,

1943
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
it's just like I was bad doing the jump thingy.

1944
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Then I feel like shit.

1945
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And that only happened once, I think.

1946
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Yeah.

1947
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
There was this funny one.

1948
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I think Craig is this rock guy and he's made of rocks.

1949
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
And he has rock-based powers.

1950
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
He stumps on the ground or he picks up

1951
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
like a little cube, little square of dirt

1952
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
and you can throw it or you can place it down.

1953
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And if someone else is Craig,

1954
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
they can also pick up that rock,

1955
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
changes it to their own color.

1956
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
They can put it down.

1957
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
But allows you, who now has no rock of your own color,

1958
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
to make another rock and place it down.

1959
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And they can then pick up your second rock,

1960
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
add it to their collection of rocks that they now have,

1961
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
because their first rock doesn't delete

1962
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
when they pick up a second rock from another Craig.

1963
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So they can't make a new rock,

1964
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
because they already have a rock,

1965
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
but you can make a rock,

1966
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
but they can steal a second rock.

1967
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Yeah.

1968
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
So there was a match where we were all Craig

1969
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
and we were all building rocks to try and make a staircase.

1970
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And it was really fun.

1971
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
That sounds pretty good.

1972
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Someone told me that Orcane in Rivals of Aether

1973
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
used to be a Vaporeon,

1974
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
like the guy had built that as a Vaporeon character

1975
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and then had just reskinned it for this original game.

1976
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And I had somehow misinterpreted that

1977
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
to mean that the whole game used to be a Pokemon game,

1978
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and all the characters used to be Pokemon.

1979
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So I was sitting there trying to think to myself,

1980
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
which Pokemon did all these used to be?

1981
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Which Pokemon did the one with the sword used to be?

1982
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
But it turns out I was wrong.

1983
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
They weren't all Pokemon.

1984
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It was just the one.

1985
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Yeah.

1986
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
For those who don't know.

1987
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Did the bird used to be a Pidgey?

1988
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
No.

1989
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Dude, Pidgey, my favorite bird.

1990
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Play Pidgey and...

1991
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
When are they going to add Pidgey to Smash?

1992
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
When are they going to add his own character?

1993
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
This is his own character.

1994
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
He's iconic.

1995
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
He's iconic.

1996
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
What are they making a Pokemon game that is Smash Brothers,

1997
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
but with all the Pokemon?

1998
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
That shouldn't be difficult.

1999
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
That's just Smash.

2000
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Wait, no, not with all of them.

2001
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Yeah.

2002
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Well, they made Puck and Tournament.

2003
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Puck and Tournament sucks.

2004
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Is that like an arena fighter?

2005
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Where you just like in 3D, you just go...

2006
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And smash them?

2007
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It's a 3D fighting game.

2008
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And I don't know how else to describe it than that.

2009
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Yeah.

2010
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I think I've seen like one second of it.

2011
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I know you can play as Gengar, which is awesome.

2012
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It's awesome that there's a fighting game where Gengar is a character.

2013
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
That rules.

2014
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Yeah, that does rule.

2015
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I think I actually have that.

2016
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Like, my brother has it.

2017
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I think we played it once.

2018
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
We're in like this in the middle of the road.

2019
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And there were cars who were presumably trying to get to work.

2020
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
But no, there's a Gengar wrestling with like some other thing.

2021
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Yeah.

2022
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It's in the way.

2023
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And they're just getting punched and licked.

2024
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Very, very nice.

2025
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Very nice.

2026
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Again, fuck.

2027
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Ah, damn it.

2028
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,000
This fucking Gengar and this Brakeson just won't stop like blasting the concrete.

2029
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
What were we talking about before we got on Rivals of Ether?

2030
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
We were talking about like stuff that happened.

2031
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Stuff and things that happened.

2032
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Stuff and things.

2033
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Oh, I went to...

2034
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
We went to see...

2035
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I mean, you didn't.

2036
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
But...

2037
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Anamonaguchi?

2038
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Anamonaguchi.

2039
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I was not there, yeah.

2040
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
They had a concert and surprisingly, tickets were still available.

2041
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I managed to grab one.

2042
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And it was this really cool venue.

2043
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And they did these Scott Pilgrim vs. The World movie, the game soundtrack.

2044
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Because they made that.

2045
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Yeah.

2046
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And so they played the whole soundtrack.

2047
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Including things like the menus and like the level select screen.

2048
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
They had like that on for a little bit.

2049
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And then it was sort of like a huge medley of the entire soundtrack where things would

2050
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:39,000
move into other things based on the way you play the game level to level.

2051
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And they had like a cool like mishmash of like video game footage and like the comic

2052
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
panels that are being depicted in the video game like flashing on screen at the appropriate

2053
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
time.

2054
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And it's like, ah, I love Scott Pilgrim.

2055
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
What was the name of the place it was at?

2056
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
The big city place.

2057
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Okay.

2058
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Big Night Live.

2059
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I don't know if that's the venue, but I think that's, I think I remember that Big Night

2060
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
N-I-T-E.

2061
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
It doesn't ring a bell.

2062
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
But it could be true nevertheless.

2063
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
It is, it was in like Central Boston, like Metropolitan.

2064
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,000
There were big buildings all around and it was quite a, quite a classy place.

2065
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It was actually really affordable for the venue it was at.

2066
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
They had like a really cool like bar.

2067
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:39,000
A couple months ago, Anamanaguchi did another show here, which I also did not go to, but

2068
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
it was at a much more like low key venue that is like not that far from my house.

2069
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
So it was probably a completely different experience.

2070
01:45:51,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Yeah, this one was like, I think it was just like so big that like, I don't know, it's

2071
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
hard to explain.

2072
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
They had like a little floor right next to the stage.

2073
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:14,000
They had steps up to a larger area that was like higher up and back a bit to the left

2074
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
and the right and the back.

2075
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And then even further back, there were like seating areas where if you paid for like a

2076
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
seated ticket, you could sit in on a little couch.

2077
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And then to the side, there was like this big bar area.

2078
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
And there was plenty of room to stand around.

2079
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It wasn't like packed or anything, just because the floor space was a lot.

2080
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And yeah, I got a cool t-shirt there, really expensive, but I think it's worth getting

2081
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
a cool expensive t-shirt for a band I like.

2082
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Did I see the shirt?

2083
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I don't know if I wore it when I was around you.

2084
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It was like a navy blue Ramona wearing a shirt of something that says Anna Managuchi.

2085
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Wait, was it Mega Man?

2086
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Did it have the little Mega Man on it?

2087
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Yeah, it had a little Mega Man Anna Managuchi and Ramona Flowers was wearing that shirt on

2088
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
my shirt that I have.

2089
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Right.

2090
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
They got a, those guys got a poster of that design.

2091
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Yes.

2092
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Put it up on the wall.

2093
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Okay.

2094
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Okay.

2095
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Ramona looked really hot in that picture.

2096
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Yeah.

2097
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
It was really hot in that fucking shirt.

2098
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Yeah, true.

2099
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Actually, I couldn't even tell if it was Ramona or just some girl drawn in the style.

2100
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Maybe it's supposed to be Ramona.

2101
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It feels like it's pretty obvious.

2102
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I mean, she's got colored hair.

2103
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh, yeah, it's probably, yeah.

2104
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
That's the tell.

2105
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Nobody else has colored hair.

2106
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
A BRB, I just got a P.

2107
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Quick.

2108
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You know what?

2109
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Me too.

2110
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
A few moments later.

2111
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
You're back.

2112
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Oh, there you are.

2113
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Yes.

2114
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Yes.

2115
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Okay.

2116
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
What do you say we started on these voicemails?

2117
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Yeah.

2118
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah.

2119
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh, I gotta get to the website.

2120
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:10,980
I just had some, actually this morning I made some gummies with my new, my newly perfected

2121
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:11,980
recipe.

2122
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:15,980
They came out, they came out perfectly.

2123
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:21,980
They're, they're just, just spectacular.

2124
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:25,980
I should, people have told me that I should make a video about how to make them.

2125
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,980
And I could do that and it wouldn't even be hard.

2126
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:34,980
But genuinely the thing that's, the main thing stopping me from doing it is that my

2127
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,980
kitchen is gross and I don't want anyone to see it.

2128
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,980
Yeah, it was a little, little grimy.

2129
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:46,980
Not, yeah, grimy and honestly, even if like I cleaned it, it's even if, yeah, even if

2130
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:49,980
I cleaned it, it would still look not great.

2131
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,980
That's why you gotta get a new place.

2132
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:57,980
You gotta get the, you gotta get a photogenic area where you can do all that.

2133
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:04,980
I mean, let's, let's, come on, it's, it's, have you seen the housing market these days?

2134
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:05,980
Nope.

2135
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:10,980
Well, nothing busting anyway.

2136
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,980
It's bad.

2137
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:15,980
It's pretty, it's, it's, it's pretty rough here.

2138
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:17,980
And it's pretty rough.

2139
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:18,980
Good live.

2140
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:22,980
I could probably live much, I could probably live much better somewhere else, but I don't

2141
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,980
want to.

2142
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,980
I don't want to have to own a car.

2143
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:30,980
I don't want to have to drive places.

2144
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,980
All right.

2145
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:35,980
How you doing on voicemails?

2146
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,980
I got, I've got the site here.

2147
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:43,980
Are you at the, the first new one is called what do you think of Arlo?

2148
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:44,980
Yep.

2149
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,980
I'm there.

2150
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:49,980
I think, okay, there's no, there's no audio.

2151
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:52,980
I think he, I don't know, he's, he's fine.

2152
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:53,980
He's fine.

2153
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:57,980
I don't keep up with him because he's like a, he's like a news guy.

2154
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:01,980
Like he reports on like the latest news of video games and I don't care about keeping

2155
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,980
up with that stuff.

2156
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,980
Yeah.

2157
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:08,980
He's, he's pretty like, like his takes are like whatever.

2158
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:10,980
Like he's a, he's a gamer.

2159
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:11,980
He is.

2160
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:12,980
Whatever.

2161
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,980
I don't feel excited to know anything about what Arlo says.

2162
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:20,980
I am excited about his puppet and I've always felt like he underutilized the comedy potential

2163
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,980
of it.

2164
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:22,980
He's just a guy.

2165
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,980
Yeah.

2166
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:27,980
He doesn't really do anything with that, but like if I had a puppet, if I had like a little

2167
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:32,980
red man, shit would go insane very quickly.

2168
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:33,980
Yeah.

2169
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:38,980
He doesn't, he very rarely like does anything with the puppet other than he just has it.

2170
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:42,980
Like it's just, it's just there and like that's fine and all.

2171
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,980
He doesn't do skits or anything with it.

2172
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,980
Well, rarely he does.

2173
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:52,980
I like a couple of his longer like specific, like reviewing a specific game videos.

2174
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:57,980
Like, I think he did one about Breath of the Wild and he's done a bunch about Paper Mario

2175
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:58,980
games.

2176
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,980
I've seen those, but I don't keep up with him.

2177
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,980
I just wanted to do a silly voice at the very least.

2178
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:05,980
Yeah.

2179
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:08,980
It's just like a little, little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl.

2180
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:12,980
I'm Arlo and he like does like that voice the entire time.

2181
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:13,980
It would be hilarious.

2182
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,980
He would have to, if he had like a second puppet that was like a different character

2183
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,980
than he did a funny voice for.

2184
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:23,980
I appreciate that his puppet just has his voice because they're basically like one in

2185
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:24,980
the same.

2186
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,980
Like I'm okay with that.

2187
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:26,980
Oh yeah.

2188
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:27,980
Yeah.

2189
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:30,980
That's me in Phantom Horn.

2190
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:31,980
Baby.

2191
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:32,980
Yeah.

2192
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:37,980
Who would win in a fight Phantom Horn versus Arlo?

2193
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:40,980
Obviously Phantom Horn, he has a katana.

2194
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:41,980
He does have a katana.

2195
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,980
He'd fucking slice him.

2196
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:50,980
Arlo had a gun though.

2197
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,980
What if Arlo had a bicarbonate reign?

2198
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:56,980
What if you had a gun, Adam Sandler?

2199
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:57,980
Okay.

2200
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:04,980
Next one is use probably don't remember the past topics, but three, two, one, go.

2201
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:10,980
They know they are wicked, but even then easily hide their shame throughout history.

2202
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:16,980
It is sadly said that even most well-circled families will spawn at least one for certain.

2203
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:22,980
Sometimes you can't even tell which in a crowd they are until you see the mellies in their

2204
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,980
eyes.

2205
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:30,980
And the worst is that with every shower I see myself slowly becoming one of them.

2206
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:32,980
This is not a critic.

2207
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:34,980
This is a warning.

2208
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:37,980
Ben St. Bows are not even people.

2209
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,980
Don't become one.

2210
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:45,980
But either way, if you dye your scalp pink, it'll be great rebranding.

2211
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,980
It'll be a great rebranding strategy.

2212
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,980
What are not people?

2213
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,980
Bows are not even people?

2214
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,980
I don't know what you're saying.

2215
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:57,980
I don't know what you're saying.

2216
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:59,980
You put a word and I didn't understand it.

2217
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:00,980
I'm sorry.

2218
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:01,980
I don't know.

2219
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:02,980
I don't know.

2220
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,980
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.

2221
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:08,980
Next one is called Unfoto Benic Saint.

2222
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:11,980
Three, two, one, go.

2223
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:12,980
Hey Ben.

2224
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:17,980
I know what it feels to think you look like a decent guy and then out comes your photo

2225
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,980
and you're this hideous ghoul.

2226
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,980
Just what I was describing before.

2227
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:26,980
And I know part of it is narcissistic bias whenever they look in the mirror.

2228
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:32,980
But I've had friends and other people telling me that I look pretty decent.

2229
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,980
Unless they're lying.

2230
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,980
They would lie, wouldn't you?

2231
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:37,980
They're just awful.

2232
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:38,980
Can't trust your friends.

2233
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:42,980
I think it's just the lack of depth that makes my face look weird.

2234
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,980
But just keep your chins up, man.

2235
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:49,980
There's uglier people out there and I think you look okay.

2236
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:50,980
Shucks.

2237
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:53,980
Yeah, well that's what Gib said and Gib was just lying to make me feel better.

2238
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:57,980
Yeah, I was lying through my teeth.

2239
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:58,980
Okay.

2240
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,980
Yeah.

2241
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,980
Just use the front-facing, or use the rear camera on your phone.

2242
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:05,980
Don't use the front-facing camera.

2243
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:08,980
The front-facing camera looks really shitty.

2244
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,980
It flattens it because of your weird perspective.

2245
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,980
It looks terrible.

2246
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,980
Never use that.

2247
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:15,980
Never use that camera.

2248
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,980
Okay, next one is...

2249
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:20,980
It's a Japanese...

2250
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:24,980
Oh, it says I'm a samurai in Hiragana.

2251
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:28,980
Three, two, one, go.

2252
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:33,980
That was a...

2253
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:36,980
That says Shanisen, maybe.

2254
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,980
Mm-hmm.

2255
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:41,980
Konnichiwa.

2256
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:45,980
Be no sento-san.

2257
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:50,980
Sesha wa samurai-sama de aru.

2258
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,980
Oroko naru waka-chan yo de wa nai.

2259
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:55,980
You can't just speak Japanese.

2260
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:00,980
Uso de aru.

2261
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:03,980
Kore ga saigo no keikoku de aru.

2262
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,980
I don't know what you're saying.

2263
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,980
Sukuroru wo kaesu.

2264
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:10,980
You gotta listen to the tone of his voice.

2265
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,980
I'm skipping ahead.

2266
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,980
What if he says something funny?

2267
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:15,980
Oh, no, it ends with a...

2268
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:16,980
Yo!

2269
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,980
It ends with that one sound effect.

2270
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,980
I heard Sayonara.

2271
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:22,980
Okay.

2272
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,980
Thanks for the voicemail.

2273
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,980
Next one.

2274
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,980
You know that whale?

2275
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,980
That one, like, Kabuki Theater?

2276
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,980
Like, yo!

2277
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,980
Whale, kind of.

2278
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:33,980
Yeah.

2279
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,980
I did a bad job of impersonating it right there.

2280
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:36,980
Yeah.

2281
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:37,980
Okay.

2282
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:38,980
Yeah.

2283
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:39,980
Next one is Ben's Weekly Reminder.

2284
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,980
Play Deltarune Chapter 2.

2285
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,980
Okay.

2286
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:45,980
Next one is Indire Need of Help.

2287
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,980
Tread Hot Wiping at Mae Dot Boy Wife.

2288
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:50,980
Three, two, one, go.

2289
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,980
So, a roommate recently told me

2290
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:56,980
that he puts powdered milk in his milk to get more milk for milk.

2291
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,980
Which got me thinking.

2292
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,980
I've been training my pelvic floor muscles on the daily in order to be able

2293
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,980
to bust mad ropes more than once

2294
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:07,980
when the blessed air get released from Valsal Dawn finally comes.

2295
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:10,980
But seeing my roommate mechanize basic bodily functions

2296
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,980
such as sustenance in an effort to maximize efficiency

2297
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:14,980
made me do a double take

2298
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:17,980
as I've been reading some French post-modern neomorphism recently.

2299
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:18,980
Am I?

2300
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:21,980
By pursuing the ability to experience multiple orgasm,

2301
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:24,980
not also just trying to get more sex per sex in an effort

2302
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:27,980
to appease some capitalistic motion of increased efficiency.

2303
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:30,980
Am I not inadvertently reducing my sexuality and enter my body

2304
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:32,980
which is imbued with the mechanics of life

2305
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:36,980
to a mechanized object mediated by capitalistic bio power?

2306
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,980
What do you think, Ben?

2307
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,980
You seem like a small cookie.

2308
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:40,980
What do I think?

2309
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:42,980
But continuing to pursue the ability to bust fat fucking ropes

2310
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:45,980
via capitulation to neoliberal hegemony.

2311
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,980
I think that was the Stanley Parable guy.

2312
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:52,980
I also think it was the Stanley Parable narrator.

2313
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,980
Does busting fat ropes contribute to neoliberal hegemony?

2314
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:57,980
Yeah.

2315
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:58,980
Sure.

2316
01:56:58,980 --> 01:56:59,980
Of course.

2317
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:03,980
I guess obviously it does.

2318
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,980
The means of production.

2319
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,980
There we go.

2320
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:09,980
There we go.

2321
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:13,980
Speaking of reading post-neoliberal Marxism

2322
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:16,980
or whatever the fuck he said,

2323
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,980
I finally got that library book

2324
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:22,980
that I put on hold weeks and weeks ago.

2325
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:23,980
The one that I meant to take it.

2326
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:24,980
The part of the deal.

2327
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:25,980
No.

2328
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:26,980
No.

2329
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:28,980
It's a book of essays by Foucault.

2330
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:30,980
I'm going to read some Foucault.

2331
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I have started it,

2332
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,980
but I have not actually gotten past the preface and introduction.

2333
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,980
I haven't actually gotten to the Foucault yet,

2334
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:40,980
but maybe soon.

2335
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:43,980
I'll let you know how that goes.

2336
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:44,980
Okay.

2337
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,980
Next one is called Dentist.

2338
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:49,980
Three, two, one, go.

2339
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,980
This morning I went to the dentist.

2340
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:52,980
Good for you.

2341
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:53,980
God, I hate the dentist.

2342
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:54,980
Yeah.

2343
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:56,980
She showed me the needle and said,

2344
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:58,980
this is going to feel long.

2345
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,980
Jesus.

2346
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:04,980
Then she slid that big pointy needle deep into my gums

2347
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:09,980
and it took a minute, a whole 60 seconds I counted.

2348
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:14,980
My eyes are watering as Rod is piercing my jaw

2349
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:16,980
and she looks me in the eyes and says,

2350
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:21,980
this wouldn't have happened if you'd have flossed.

2351
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:22,980
Yeah.

2352
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:26,980
That's how it goes.

2353
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:30,980
And also she put her penis in my mouth.

2354
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:33,980
Oh no.

2355
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:36,980
Well, that's going to be me pretty soon.

2356
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:41,980
If I'm good and I do my diligence and I actually fucking,

2357
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,980
I won't take too long to complain about this,

2358
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:47,980
but I had this feeling that I need to get dental insurance

2359
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,980
before I go to the dentist.

2360
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:51,980
So I haven't scheduled a dentist appointment.

2361
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:54,980
So I tried to look for dental insurance and I don't understand it

2362
01:58:54,980 --> 01:58:58,980
and it all seems kind of like it's fake and it doesn't actually do anything.

2363
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:03,980
I mean, I would assume that the whole point

2364
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,980
is that you need some company to do it for you.

2365
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:09,980
Because they don't want you to be able to be insured.

2366
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,980
If you have a job and they have good dental,

2367
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:16,980
it means that they have a way to get through the bullshit

2368
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:19,980
and allow you to have dental insurance.

2369
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:24,980
Yeah, but then shouldn't there be some...

2370
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:27,980
There should be a private option, right?

2371
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:28,980
Like if...

2372
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:29,980
I mean, I don't know.

2373
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:32,980
I would have thought so, but I can't...

2374
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:34,980
I don't know.

2375
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:36,980
Got to get YouTube dental.

2376
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,980
Got to be a million subscribers.

2377
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:39,980
You get great dental.

2378
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:45,980
Maybe I need to like bullshit my way into a job with dental insurance.

2379
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:48,980
Just to go to the dentist.

2380
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:51,980
What if the dental insurance company doesn't have good dental?

2381
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:53,980
That's the trick.

2382
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,980
I just don't know.

2383
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,980
Alright, that's something to think about.

2384
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,980
I don't want to dwell on it right now.

2385
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,980
Alright, next one is called...

2386
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,980
This is going to be a long one, isn't it?

2387
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:08,980
Three, two, one, go.

2388
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:12,980
Okay, time to make a compilation of the Twilight saga.

2389
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:14,980
I wonder how long total playtime is.

2390
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:15,980
Let me check.

2391
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:17,980
What do you mean 30 minutes?

2392
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:21,980
And I plan on adding more context and explanations to.

2393
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:23,980
And some visuals along the way.

2394
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:24,980
Fuck.

2395
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:25,980
Really? 30 minutes?

2396
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:28,980
30 minute long video with visuals?

2397
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:30,980
That's gonna take a while.

2398
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:33,980
True.

2399
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:34,980
Let's see.

2400
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:35,980
Hold on.

2401
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,980
I'm trying to keep these downloaded as I go.

2402
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:39,980
Okay, got to download that one.

2403
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,980
Got to download that one.

2404
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:42,980
Okay.

2405
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:44,980
Then I got to download this latest one.

2406
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:45,980
Alright.

2407
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:46,980
Next one is called...

2408
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:49,980
I, Ethan Ralf, have fixed what you did to him, Ben Saint.

2409
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,980
And then there's a really long email.

2410
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,980
Three, two, one, go.

2411
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:06,980
Hey, we son, we're home.

2412
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:10,980
You and I, father and son, Ethan Ralf Jr.

2413
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:14,980
And his dad, Ethan Ralf Sr. Me.

2414
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,980
That's how I talk to my son.

2415
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,980
Ethan Ralf, son.

2416
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:24,980
Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian.

2417
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:28,980
Hey, we, it's me, Ethan Ralf Jr.

2418
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:32,980
Reborn into a good old Christian boy.

2419
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:33,980
Yes.

2420
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,980
I have to tell you something.

2421
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:39,980
Was that, son?

2422
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:45,980
I have to tell you that I still hate Ben Saint.

2423
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:48,980
And I'm gonna kill him.

2424
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:52,980
Well, son, it looks like we might be able to

2425
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:56,980
make an arrangement for that.

2426
02:01:56,980 --> 02:01:57,980
In America.

2427
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,980
God bless America.

2428
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:01,980
In America.

2429
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,980
God bless America.

2430
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,980
Man, like this game.

2431
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:07,980
Ethan Ralf.

2432
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,980
Ethan Ralf has grown on me.

2433
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:12,980
Yeah, I was just gonna say, I'm starting out

2434
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:13,980
as a Christian boy.

2435
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:14,980
I'm a Christian boy.

2436
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:16,980
I'm a Christian boy.

2437
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:17,980
I'm a Christian boy.

2438
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:18,980
I'm a Christian boy.

2439
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:19,980
I'm a Christian boy.

2440
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,980
And you have grown on me.

2441
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:22,980
Yeah, I was just gonna say, I'm starting,

2442
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:23,980
I'm starting to come around.

2443
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,980
Maybe he's not so bad after all.

2444
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,980
Wait, did I download that one?

2445
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,980
Yes, I did.

2446
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:38,980
Okay, next one is called just sendö funnysffs 321go.

2447
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:43,980
Dan, the cringest thing about the PCP podcast is

2448
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:47,980
definitely nicely trying to argue about shit like

2449
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:53,300
You're you're literally hearing this show have fun and you bring

2450
02:02:54,660 --> 02:03:00,060
How been sent in a cycle before ever either way you wouldn't change

2451
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:07,140
The body casters minds like so stupid

2452
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:13,860
But anyway, like what's laborally that bad really

2453
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:20,660
I

2454
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:32,300
Next one is called can we just get this over with already three two one go

2455
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:38,140
Then send Joe Salma. Can you show what style do you need for rad can do gin?

2456
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:42,220
Maybe as United people that will not be fight it

2457
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:49,500
We can find a person with a right style sooner than you will upload the episodes to Apple or play delta rune chapter 2

2458
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,020
I I

2459
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:56,820
Mean all you would have to do is look up Ed and you would see how he how he draws and that's the style

2460
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:59,380
That I want to approximate

2461
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:04,020
Kaiju might be drawing it after all again, maybe

2462
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:08,580
I don't know. I've been talking to him a little bit. He says he might have some time

2463
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:15,220
So that might happen. I found another artist on line webtoon who

2464
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:20,420
What did not have like a ton of views, but whose style I thought was really good

2465
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:24,380
And so I might ask them if Kaiju falls through again

2466
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:27,780
But we'll see I

2467
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,860
Don't know. That's

2468
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:31,860
That's sort of progressing

2469
02:04:32,980 --> 02:04:34,980
Yeah, yeah

2470
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:42,180
The next one is called finally speaking out against the specter haunting Twitter three two one go

2471
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:47,100
I've come to make an announcement when saints a bitch as motherfucker

2472
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:51,980
He's such a jealous bitch showing his ass and wanting people to talk about him and he pissed on my fucking boy wife

2473
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:52,580
That's right

2474
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:55,740
He took a soy boy Quillie gig out and he pissed on my fucking me to her boy wife

2475
02:04:55,740 --> 02:04:58,420
And he said his dick was this big and I said that's disgusting

2476
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,940
So I'm making a call up post on my Twitter.com

2477
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:07,460
You're a known harasser that has spent his last year of his life bullying a trans creator and you've got a small dick

2478
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:13,780
It's the size of your online celebrity status except way smaller. Guess what here's what my done looks like that's right, baby

2479
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:17,580
All points no quills no pillows. Look at that

2480
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:22,660
It looks like the balls in a bond and it's almost as long as the time you want without lifting. Oh

2481
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,860
Got ya

2482
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:30,700
Almost as long as the time I went without what Wi-Fi lifting

2483
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:37,380
No, my gains have suffered

2484
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:40,540
Thanks to COVID and other things

2485
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:46,960
That's okay. I'll get them all back. I'll get them all back and more. I'm just biting my time

2486
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:54,100
Become even stronger. I don't like it like a Pokemon that waits to evolve so we can learn moves sooner

2487
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:58,380
I'm just waiting to become strong until later so that I can be stronger in the long run

2488
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:04,180
That's I'm gonna wait until my muscles are suddenly here for the until they're ready

2489
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:07,620
Ali of the Ark until they're ready to start pumping up and then

2490
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:12,020
It's there's a so there's more it's more art than science. Trust me

2491
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:21,780
Did I download that one? No, okay next one is called. Yes, I am picking fights in the voicemail three two one go

2492
02:06:24,340 --> 02:06:28,660
I feel like you guys get too many voicemails of people asking for like analysis

2493
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:36,420
Like can you please explain your thought process and motives for x event or opinion?

2494
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:39,860
I can't understand if you don't give me a

2495
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,500
hyper detailed analysis

2496
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:46,500
Or just people asking you to explain

2497
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:48,340
like

2498
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:50,340
Years long events

2499
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:52,420
like which the tricksy drama like

2500
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:57,460
Bruh, you can't explain that in like a 15 minute chunk

2501
02:06:58,340 --> 02:06:59,780
let alone

2502
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,780
In response to a voicemail

2503
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:04,020
That's like do some research

2504
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:05,860
Yeah, and maybe

2505
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:07,060
like

2506
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:11,220
Don't ask people to give like 30 minute diatribes on their opinions

2507
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:13,460
and just

2508
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,420
Like

2509
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,700
Let it go. Don't leave a stupid voicemail. I don't know

2510
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,500
It's it's it's a lot

2511
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:23,540
Please stop. Yeah, uh, I can't I I've

2512
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:26,740
Not don't think I'm

2513
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:32,100
In the mood to answer such questions anymore. I've answered them so many times already. Yeah

2514
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:36,660
Uh, I guess I agree. I I yeah, I mean when it comes to like

2515
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:40,820
I don't know prompts that could spark discussion. I don't hate those

2516
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:42,900
But a lot of the time

2517
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,420
If it's if it's just remember that remember that post in the comments

2518
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:50,980
I posted that was just like what happened to the other people on the podcast and it's like

2519
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:56,900
Those sorts of things that bro first of all you could literally just see that you could literally just go look them up

2520
02:07:56,900 --> 02:08:02,820
And see what they're doing like why are you here asking this now like two years later?

2521
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:05,860
like like it's just it's just not the

2522
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:10,980
This is not how you get an answer to that and it's it's dumb. So yeah, I

2523
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:14,420
Some sometimes I feel the way this guy feels

2524
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:16,260
um

2525
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,500
Okay, the next one is

2526
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:23,140
Well, there's an image. So let me um, yeah, it's a pirate flag something

2527
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:26,580
Uh, hang on. I haven't described pirates

2528
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:29,620
Oh, no

2529
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,620
Oh, this was my

2530
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:38,900
Oh, no, someone found my uh, my old uh, like jolly roger my fan jolly roger that I made when I was like a kid

2531
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,380
I had no idea

2532
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:43,380
That's really funny

2533
02:08:43,700 --> 02:08:45,700
Where would it have been

2534
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:49,620
Did you have like my maybe like my old facebook or something?

2535
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:55,860
Yeah from like when I or maybe no maybe like my myspace when I was in like high school

2536
02:08:57,780 --> 02:09:00,900
Crazy, I was a fucking they do have audio in this voicemail

2537
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:05,700
Yeah, so let's uh, let's give that a listen three two one go

2538
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:10,980
An explanation skull is a symbol of lasting value in memory after a person dies

2539
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:13,220
They leave behind not just a body

2540
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:17,940
And in this way continue to exist in our own world in addition to whatever lies beyond

2541
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,700
The skull represents this idea

2542
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:24,660
Since it is the most distinctive physical remnant of a person who has died the feathers symbolize knowledge and morality

2543
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:28,020
They are blue the color of wisdom and thought cherubim before the water baby

2544
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:31,380
Symbolized wisdom and we're often portrayed as blue holding box

2545
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:35,860
This intelligent shit gives the feathers their moral significance calm down spike the three yellow diamonds represent light

2546
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:40,900
Not a constant radiance, but a more subtle gleaming signifying a semi-divine perfection reminiscent of plate on

2547
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:47,460
Ideal forms the three individually represent body mind and spirit perfection of each of which can and should be sought independently of one another

2548
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:50,340
So bad. Have you achieved perfection of any of the three?

2549
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:54,260
I think body can be ruled out considering the dismal state of your physical exercise and hair

2550
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:01,460
I

2551
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,340
I

2552
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,140
think

2553
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:04,900
I might have written

2554
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:10,660
I think some of this might be based on like I might have written an explanation of what the symbolism of the

2555
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:13,620
Flag was supposed to be I thought that sounded

2556
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:19,700
Like yeah, something a young ben may have written. I think that might be

2557
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:27,620
Yeah, I wasn't they could have just been like speculating themselves. No, I think that was from a description that I wrote and

2558
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,260
uh

2559
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:31,540
No

2560
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:33,540
The answer is no

2561
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:37,300
I was I was um

2562
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:43,700
I don't I don't know. I don't know what else to say about it. I was really I thought angels were really cool

2563
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:46,180
I really liked the metatron

2564
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,900
I learned who the metatron was and I thought he was the coolest

2565
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:52,500
And I read somewhere that he was like the scribe of heaven heaven

2566
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:57,140
I don't actually think that's true or most sources don't really describe him that way

2567
02:10:57,140 --> 02:11:01,700
But someone said he was and I was like, oh, that's cool. That's a cool title the scribe of heaven

2568
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:03,620
um

2569
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:05,380
So I made that my

2570
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:07,380
Theme for my pirate flag

2571
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:09,940
There you go

2572
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:11,140
There you go

2573
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:12,340
um

2574
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:16,660
It looks kind of like the the the it's a clown head with blue hair

2575
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:23,380
You know what I mean? Oh, I see I see yeah, if you took away the bottom parts of the feathers

2576
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:28,500
That's the first thing I thought but then I noticed they will like continue

2577
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:34,180
Yeah, I see what I do see what you mean. It kind of does look like that. Listen. I was uh, I was pretty bad at stuff

2578
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:37,620
Back then still am some might say

2579
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:39,940
um

2580
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:43,140
Man, this is embarrassing. All right, let's let's move on. Uh

2581
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:45,700
Uh

2582
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:50,500
Did I download that one 752? Yes, I did. Okay next one is

2583
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:53,700

2587
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:20,420
Please please leave me alone. Uh, whoever this is. Uh, that's all I have to say

2588
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:27,060
Uh, I gave myself a gun. I thought shotguns were cool. And you know what? I was right. I stand by it

2589
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:31,700
Um, are you in heaven? I wasn't heaven. Yeah, it was heaven scribe

2590
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:35,140
Oh, that's that's the guy the scribe of heaven. Yeah, sure. Why not?

2591
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:42,180
Uh, next one is called wait wait wait, there's there's audio. Yeah

2592
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:49,300
Oh, I think that was probably my post

02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,420
Whatever

2594
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:57,620
I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed of myself. You know what? This was cool. I used to be this cool

2595
02:12:57,780 --> 02:12:59,780
You wish you were this cool as me

2596
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:03,220
Uh, all right, I never made a south park of myself

2597
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:06,900
Oh, oh, you're missing out. I've never been that cool. So, you know what?

2598
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:13,620
Check's out. You're miss you're missing out. It's it's it's good. Shit. Okay, uh,

2599
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:18,900
You can download that audio right there. Uh, next one is same guy from before

2600
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:21,460
three two one go

2601
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:26,820
Sorry, I'm leaving a follow-up voicemail, but I'm sevin

2602
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,900
I

2603
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:34,580
Like whenever you say like, oh, what did you mean like that? It's like if you're hanging with your friend

2604
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:37,860
And you said, uh, I hate kids

2605
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:44,820
Or whatever don't want to have kids and they were like, um, don't you realize but everyone was a kid once and uh,

2606
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:48,500
Because you're a necessary party society. Can you explain what you mean by that? Like

2607
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:51,620
No real human would say that

2608
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,980
No actual human would respond like that

2609
02:13:55,940 --> 02:14:01,220
They would just go, oh, yeah, I like kids or oh, okay. Yeah, I get that like

2610
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:04,900
Just

2611
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,180
don't

2612
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:11,860
Stop please. Okay. Okay. He's saying that the way people ask questions is not like

2613
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:19,460
The way people talk to each other when they're having a genuine conversation. That's probably true

2614
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:26,100
But I wouldn't I wouldn't really expect it to be I wouldn't expect a voicemailer to ask me something in the same

2615
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:28,820
cadence as like

2616
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:30,820
A friend I was just hanging out with

2617
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:34,980
I get yeah, I think this guy has higher expectations for voicemailers than I do

2618
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:41,940
Well, I guess it's sort of like a because not all voicemails on on podcasts are about like asking questions

2619
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:45,380
Or like asking to explain things. They may just have something

2620
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:48,420
to mention

2621
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:51,060
That on on the pcp. They're often like

2622
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:54,180
questions because

2623
02:14:54,740 --> 02:15:00,100
The we used to have questions and then we had voicemail and then we got answers. Yeah

2624
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:05,460
Uh, I mean

2625
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:09,780
That yeah, that would there there are there are there are people that get all

Inquisitive annoyingly inquisitive at you and those people are annoying

2627
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:17,860
Um

2628
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:19,540
Yeah, okay

2629
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:21,540
The next couple voicemails are all

2630
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:25,460
It's all just text posts and it's just a list of

2631

Hey guys, it's me the death note fun fact guy. Here's the death note fun fact

2639
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:14,500
Did you know that near and mellow l successors were originally intended to be l's twin sons?

2640
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:19,780
Eventually the idea was shot down because the writer of the manga could not imagine l having sex

2641
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:26,900
There you go, there's the death note fun fact c and x news for another actually fun fact actually is a pretty fun fact

2642
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:30,500
It is a is a fun fact and I also can't imagine l

2643
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:36,580
I feel like he wouldn't find it intellectually stimulating enough. I also can't imagine having sex

2644
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:40,100
Myself because it's not intellectually stimulating enough

2645
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:45,860
Uh, so me and l you mean you put the penis in and take it out and you just put it in again

02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:54,260
with that

2648
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:56,260

2651
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:05,060
and there I am

2652
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:07,220
And I look I look great

2653
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:10,020
Yeah, it's awesome

2654
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:13,140
Love it a sword got a sword got a tattoo

2655
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,500
It's it's it's more it's more of a

2656
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,580
of a

2657
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:20,580
plum

2658
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:23,780
Oh, it's black sword. Oh, you mean like you mean like like one piece

2659
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:26,500
something something black sword

2660
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:28,980
Uh, no, not really

2661
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:34,980
It's just that swords are usually light colored and this is like dyed the metal is has been dyed or

2662
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:39,220
It's some reason not a light

2663
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:42,180
silvery sort of color

2664
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,900
There's a thing isn't that that's a thing in one piece, right?

2665
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:47,460
Some swords are black swords

2666
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:53,380
And that's good. So it's a it's a hacky thing. It's like uh the same way that if you have a hacky infused punch

2667
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:58,020
Um, turn your hand your fist black. Yeah, and it'll make your

2668
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,980
Visually like fist black

2669
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:04,660
And some swords can be infused with hacky so that they are

2670
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:09,460
Forever black and very powerful base. That's me

2671
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:12,660
I did it. That's you

2672
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:15,140
Uh, very nice

2673
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:19,780
Next one is called I couldn't get to finishing page two. I cry

2674
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:22,820
three two one go

2675
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:27,620
Hey guys, I'm I'm not gonna be able to get the second page of that comic

2676
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:30,660
I'm drawing of you done by tomorrow

2677
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,060
Sorry

2678
02:18:33,060 --> 02:18:35,060
In the meantime

2679
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:37,300
Or whoever the guest might be

2680
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:42,100
Uh, did you think give give a kiss for me? Thanks

2681
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:44,100
Nope

2682
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:46,980
Oh, but late little too late dang

2683
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:52,180
I'm not in the same cut train anymore. If only this person had sent this voicemail three weeks ago

2684
02:18:52,980 --> 02:18:54,180
Oops

2685
02:18:54,180 --> 02:18:58,500
They did the joke is they did send it three weeks ago. We just didn't listen to them until now

2686
02:18:59,220 --> 02:19:05,700
Uh, okay next one. I guess I guess briefly. Um, people might wonder why we didn't do live episodes

2687
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:11,060
Yeah, uh, aside from me having covid it technically could have been possible

2688
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:15,540
But I didn't really want like the stay to be like a work thing. I was just sort of

2689
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:19,940
Having a break and traveling and seeing people having fun

2690
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:23,060
Yeah, and it would have been a kind of awkward just I don't know

2691
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:26,340
Pause all that and sit down and talk about stuff

2692
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:30,740
We could have we could have done it. We could have done it, but uh, oh well

2693
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,660
Like I think I mentioned

2694
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:37,060
I might have mentioned this at the beginning, but like I could have recorded episodes on my own

2695
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:39,620
But I just didn't

2696
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,020
I just didn't feel like doing three Ben casts in a row

2697
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:45,140
Understandable. Yeah

2698
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:47,060
um

2699
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:52,820
So I just so I just like ah fuck it let's wait let's wait until the trip's over and then the trip got artificially extended

2700
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:55,060
By coronavirus

2701
02:19:56,100 --> 02:20:00,900
Uh, next one is called th versus f three two one go

2702
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:07,060
In episode 314 oblivion four was posturing that the difference between the th sound and the f sound is the emphasis

2703
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:09,940
Which isn't really true for me and might explain why it gets the mixed up

2704
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:13,380
For me a th sound involves pretty much sticking out my tongue between my teeth

2705
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:18,660
While an f sound has my tongue a bit further back in my top row of teeth by my bottom lip seems pretty different to me

2706
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:23,700
Uh, it is you're correct. Maybe that's why oblivion can't pronounce it, right?

2707
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:26,740
He doesn't know the difference

2708
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:32,020
Don't know how to do it. Yeah, someone's someone just got to explain it in the difference and then and then it'll click

2709
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:36,740
Yeah, so it's a logic uh puzzle. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

2710
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:39,460
uh

2711
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:41,460
Okay, downloading that one

2712
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:45,300
Next one is called. What's your opinion on the english pokemon logo?

2713
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:52,180
I think it is terrible at gmail.com. Um, do you mean do you mean like the yellow letters with the blue border?

2714
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:54,580
What else could they mean?

2715
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:56,500
I mean, it's

2716
02:20:56,500 --> 02:21:01,380
I don't know. It's it's it's pretty boring as logos go. It's just the name of the thing in a funny font

2717
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:08,660
I I don't know. I've always I mean, maybe it's just due to supreme over saturation of it

2718
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:11,220
Um, but it seems iconic

2719
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:14,180
I mean it is now

2720
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:20,180
Yeah, it is now. It's just sort of like well. I mean iconic. It's not it's not much of a cool and like unique

2721
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:24,660
Maybe it isn't maybe it's very like early 2000s

2722
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:27,700
I think it's not much of a logo

2723
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:34,980
Really, it's just I don't I think it is pretty lame when a brand's logo is just a word in a font

2724
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:40,660
Uh, I mean it's it is a print. I mean, I guess it's an iconic font. I guess it's somewhat unique

2725
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:42,660
But it's not like

2726
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:46,020
Yeah, I think I agree not not that impressed with it

2727
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:52,420
You know, I've just realized that the the o's don't actually look like pokeballs, which is strange

2728
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:55,700
Why not? Yeah, that's that's a layout

2729
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:58,580
They just look they kind of look like eyes

2730
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:01,140
Which is distracting

2731
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:07,460
Yeah, they got a little moon they got the little moon in there little little moonshine like eye shine thing

2732
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:10,420
Hmm

2733
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:16,260
The o's are the o's are maybe the most unique thing about this font

2734
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:21,780
But like to what end? Hmm

2735
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:30,660
Yeah, it's not it's not much of a logo and then there's just this fucking the little uh, we the fucking uh comic sands gotta catch them all underneath

2736
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:36,820
Oh, I'm not saying that uh some some versions of it have that included

2737
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:44,500
And like typed in a pokemon logo japanese and it just just sort of looks it looks less dynamic

2738
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:49,460
I prefer the english one to the japanese one of the same style. I guess

2739
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:55,940
I think the japanese one looks fine

2740
02:22:57,060 --> 02:23:02,020
Honestly, I think I like a lot of japanese ones like the every time there's a new generation. They change it a little bit

2741
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:04,660
It depends on the yeah, they do

2742
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:12,260
They do I think I like the japanese more, but it's just because to me those symbols don't just look like boring letters

2743
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:15,540
They look more interesting to me because I don't

2744
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:18,420
Read them

2745
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:20,420
phonetically

2746
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:24,180
So that's that's not really a that's that's not really a

2747
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:26,900
Praise it's just a me thing

2748
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:31,940
It's just I mean for me like japanese letters because I don't know any japanese

2749
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:35,460
My eyes glaze over it. I don't know where to start reading it

2750
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:40,500
So it doesn't feel like I don't read it. It just looks like cool symbols. It just just well

2751
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:45,060
I like it. Some people would say cool. Yeah, like me

2752
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:47,940
I would say

2753
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:51,300
Nothing gobbledygook. It's just like gobbledygook. It's mishmash

2754
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:54,420
This japanese language is all greek to me

2755
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:00,260
Next one is the superior ben saint and then there's this image

2756
02:24:01,220 --> 02:24:03,220
