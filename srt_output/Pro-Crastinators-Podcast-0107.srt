00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ah, boo.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it in.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Fine. Hi, everyone. Welcome to the episode about what is the limit of free speech?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What is the show that we're on?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You have to say the name of the show.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, no, he doesn't. They don't know.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, freedom of speech. He doesn't have to say anything, motherfuckers.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Should it be illegal to chew Tums whilst doing a podcast?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, you should be eating Tums at all times.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, this is a terrible idea. I disagree with you.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Tums taste disgusting.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I hate Tums. They taste like vitamins.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Tums are alright.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What about chewing on Mentos while you drink Diet Coke?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Endless Jess eats through an entire thing of Tums just because he likes them.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For fucking leisure?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You know, Michelle has had a stomach ache. I've just snacked on some Tums when there's Tums around.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've eaten like two or three.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't think I've ever even had a Tums.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's like the same with those gummy vitamins. They're delicious.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They're just giant sweet tarts that are fucking great and they make your stomach not hurt anymore.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And you can eat like ten of them a day.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Tums taste good?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tums are bizarre and disgusting like twisted interpretation of like a butter mint.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They're like butter mints, but they taste like cough medicines.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you guys remember when I found that jar of gummy vitamins that had melted in the sun

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and fused into a puck and I carefully extracted the puck from the bottom of the bottle

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then took a big bite out of it and briefly became the healthiest creature in the universe

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and leveled the entire city block that I was living in.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You guys can introduce now.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, so who's here?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, let's get over to the left over here.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We have a man who crosses professional boundaries to criticize individuals in his own medium, Digibro.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I am a monster of a man.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I will rape.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We have the sometimes frustratingly silent hypocrite.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nigger.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It wasn't silent just then.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, no.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We have the man who deigns to criticize an entire half of Homestuck, Munch.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's me, welcome to Manga Mondays.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Today we're going to be talking about sex.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah, trick you.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We have the resident nigger guy, Nate Besteman.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's not accurate.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Also, I would say that lesbians are physically incapable of having sex with each other.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's my free speech.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Guys, I didn't know this until I thought about it for a second like three years ago.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Scissoring isn't possible, basically.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, you can get close.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What do you mean it's not possible?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The Mac doesn't check out, Ben.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It just doesn't check out.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Audience weigh in. Tell us when the last time you scissored was.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Think about it. Think about the actual act of scissoring.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What do you mean?

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There wouldn't be enough pressure.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You make the pressure.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you trying to say that two vaginas being pressed together can't cut through paper?

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is that what you mean?

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, that is what I mean.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They'll moisten and tear the paper.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It won't be a clean cut.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's why lesbians don't check from construction work.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We have been female black faces saying that.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow, female black face is just offensive.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Regular black face is back and it's cool again.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But female black face is out.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's still not okay.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You know, we're not there yet.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Give it time. Give it time.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That reminds me of my old catchphrase nigger bitch funeral

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that I kept saying all the time and people would give me weird looks

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and I was like, I don't know why I keep saying it.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And we have Tom, who I can't really think of anything you've said that's ever been offensive,

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
so introduce yourself.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm scared of this episode already.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is going to be good.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We've got two loaded episodes back to back.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Tom, according to...

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tom, communism is the only moral economic system.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It was originally Karl Marx's birthday.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My lord and savior, apparently.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, was it his birthday?

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, that's right. Happy birthday, Karl. You did it, buddy.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You did the episode properly.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To begin the actual topic, has this ever happened to you?

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Complain about something that people are doing to which someone else goes,

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
well, it's my free speech to which someone else goes,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
well, it's my free speech to criticize your free speech,

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to where someone else goes,

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to my free speech to criticize your free speech,

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to criticize my free speech,

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to which someone else should go.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why do you even following this line of argument,

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but no one ever does?

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's what we call a free speech cascade.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That was a words cascade that just washed over me.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like, I was drowning in the ocean.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, it's been every day of my life.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The last 15 years have been on the fucking Internet, man.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, I mean, it's been forever.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You'll see a lot of the time these days.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
People want to get technical victories over each other,

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
so someone will say something,

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and maybe it's slightly overly general,

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and the other person will say,

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
well, that doesn't apply to everyone.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right, you know what it is?

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's the modern gun.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because guns were invented so retards don't get killed.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're like, oh, I'm physically deficient and weak,

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and big people can beat me up and take everything I have,

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so I'm going to invent a device.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is that what we call a retard?

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A physical retard.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, well, you know, if you are in any way,

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
if you are in any way retarded,

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
as in, like, to be lessened in some way,

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
like you are lessened than the regular human.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You mean, like, disabled,

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
do you just mean, like, people who are not able to punch some other line?

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean, like, when you say, like, something's claimed retardant,

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you mean to say that it, like, is not capable or claimed?

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't think that's a common term.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Retarded just means slow.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I see it all the time.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you're too slow, like, you're not fat,

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you can't run away from the big guns

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
who are going to catch you and beat your ass.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sonic is a ultimate neurotypical.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He's always fucking mansplaining.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So what you're saying is that nowadays

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you just use technical fallacies to, like, get out of here.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
On the internet, what is strength?

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is physical strength is intelligence,

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because all anyone has is their words and their argument.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So if you're intelligent, that means that, theoretically,

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you should destroy everybody on the internet.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
However, they invented guns,

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and the guns are called rhetorical argument,

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
where they can fuck you on the technical aspects of your argument,

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and they don't have to be intelligent.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They just have to know these so-called rules.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But, like, because of the fact that if you're too intelligent

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and you're actually following the rules,

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
but doing it in a way that, like, goes above people's heads,

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
then it doesn't matter, because they have the gun, you know?

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, and if you're too intelligent,

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
you could, theoretically, say everything exactly right,

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but people will just latch in on one of the, you know,

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
areas that touches something that's simply politically

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
incorrect or incorrect,

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and then they can just make a whole case about how, like,

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it's not that your argument is wrong,

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's that you shouldn't be listened to because you've said, you know,

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that's basically what happened with that Google thing, right?

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, that's true.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When can I cash in my IQ points for various prizes at the store?

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I want to cash in it for tickets or coins.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You do that at Chuck E. Cheese, dude.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You just got to go there.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a game of wits to Chuck E. Cheese, yeah.

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, hey, everybody.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's why you go to school.

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You go to school to build up your IQ points,

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to go to Chuck E. Cheese to cash him in

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
for a plastic ring shaped like a spider,

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and then you do all these things.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's like when I played Ganguro Girl,

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and many of the clones of Ganguro Girl,

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
where you got to go to the library and read

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to buff your intelligence points so that you can woo

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the slutty girls who like smart guys.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The titular Ganguro.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I was at Stephen Buster's,

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and I was getting mad IQ points

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
while studying the art of monkey ball,

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and I got so smart that I was able to purchase

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
with my raw brain power a Pinkie Pie plush.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is your story.

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Whoa, holy shit.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The Pinkie Pie would be pleased by this story.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Guys, I think no one should be able to say anything

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
at any time, regardless of circumstance,

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
or law, or whatever amendment made.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's your freedom of speech to think that, so, you know?

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We did cover how language is a problem,

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but we got to just ban it.

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I've been asleep since the last PCP,

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and my memory is a little hazy.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I just woke up from a stupor.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The last one we did was on language, right?

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's like the same thing.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's like a sequel.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Also, it is.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've got to put the build upon.

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The fatigue department as well.

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The groundwork.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You've got to build upon the groundwork that we laid.

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Specifically what the prompt of this episode is,

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
because we're trying to sometimes have prompts

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that are like full sentences rather than just single words.

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So that the conversation isn't so amorphous and vague

214
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and weirdly utilitarian.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The specific title, for us at least,

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
is what is the limit of free speech,

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because that's where really interesting

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and also very frustrating debates take root,

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
which is when there's things right on the line

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
between someone expressing themselves

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and someone pulling off an extortion.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey, can I?

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Can I?

224
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wait, I got something.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I just looked up.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm looking at the definition of free speech

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
on UrbanDictionary.com,

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I got to say it's extremely enlightening.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Here we go.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Get ready for this truth bomb, everyone.

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Free speech, dictionary definition,

232
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the right to express any opinions

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
without censorship or restraint.

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
College definition,

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the right to express any opinions

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
without censorship or restraint,

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
unless you're a conservative.

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Got him.

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Smash.

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Smash the glass ceiling.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Smash the conservatory.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So that is that writing prompt,

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that question prompt of what are the limits?

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh wait, definition two?

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Definition two?

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nothing more than an illusion.

249
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Wow.

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This guy is moose.

251
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Moose, this guy moose who wrote that one.

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Moose, he's a woke boy.

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well done, champ.

254
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let me throw out my position,

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and then I'd be interested to hear rebuttals,

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
because I think mine is one of the extremes.

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I think, like,

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
so free speech is a legal issue.

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's like, should you be put in jail

260
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
for saying things that are wrong?

261
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think that you should literally not

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
be criminally penalized

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
for saying literally anything,

264
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
except, oh, but okay, that's not true,

265
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
because then the shedding of fire

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and a crowd at theater could actually kill people.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
As long as your words.

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, by extension, let's say, for example,

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that there's a Jewish kid,

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and then everyone starts calling him a kike,

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and then he kills himself.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If that happens, what's the connection here?

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is that free speech?

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Should that be criminalized?

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The thing about it is that

276
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the speech is not entirely the point.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They could have just easily said,

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we don't like you, you're different,

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and none of those words are technically wrong,

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but that is what killed them.

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The words themselves don't matter.

282
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't think those people are responsible for his death.

283
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They're not murderers,

284
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but they were deliberately abusive,

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
which is not cool.

286
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I mean, I would say that they

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
just give people free reign to do that.

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I would say that his death is partly,

289
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
they are partly to blame,

290
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but it had nothing to do with the word choice.

291
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Can we at least agree on this to begin with?

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No individual word itself

293
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
should ever be forbidden from being spoken.

294
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Exactly what I wanted to bring in and say,

295
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I wanted to say that outside of context,

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
no individual word can possibly be seen as harmful

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
unless there are certain frequencies

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
in our fucking neuro system that can be irritated

299
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
by certain syllables.

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There is no way that individual words

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
outside of context should be put into the realm

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
for niggers only if you know what I mean.

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think the fact that even in academic

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
or journalistic writing,

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you have to say the N word,

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that is so immature and ridiculous to me,

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because we know what the fucking word is!

308
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I know what it is!

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just say the word, I'm not a child!

310
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you say it, I'm gonna think it!

311
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, you bitches.

312
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Think inwardly.

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is this really helpful?

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Wait, did you say think inwardly?

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know, right?

316
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We sent this episode with the word inward

317
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and I kept thinking it was inward

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and if you listen back to that,

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you'll hear me saying inward.

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, how interesting.

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, we wouldn't be showing that.

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No, but there you go.

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But anyway, I was gonna say that like,

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the reason I think people say inward

325
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is specifically for kids, right?

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's the big thing that everybody comes back to.

327
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But here's my position.

328
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, okay, maybe not.

329
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Maybe with a word like nigger.

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You better not let your kid listen to a single rap song ever.

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
See, but that's my point.

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm listening to Kanye.

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We gotta ban hip-hop because we love black people.

334
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hip-hop that uses the N word, I guess.

335
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But okay, here's my position.

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Was that racist of me to imply

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that black people make rap music?

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's about as racist as saying

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that black people play more basketball,

341
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
which I think is just true, right?

342
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe I was racist.

343
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let me look up the urban dictionary of basketball

344
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and we can get to the bottom of this.

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, here's the important thing about this.

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
First, I was gonna say that kids should just hear any word.

347
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't care, it's fine.

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But about this other topic about being racist or whatever,

349
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think that there's two important things to do

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
at the same time when you're making any of these kind of statements,

351
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and it sort of relates to free speech.

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's that you can make statements about groups

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that just are demonstrably true.

354
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
For example, black people are more propensity

355
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
to get sickle cell anemia or whatever.

356
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's simply a fact.

357
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But then if you look at an individual black person

358
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and you say, hey buddy, you're getting sickle cell anemia,

359
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that is in fact racist because you're discriminating based on race.

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Every individual just needs to be treated as an individual.

361
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I prefer Cooley's anemia.

362
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I have to go back a step.

363
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's my favorite anemia.

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
My mind is being torn and twain thinking about this.

365
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I need all of you to participate in this with me

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and ask me this question of yourself.

367
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're like Mark Twain who wrote literature

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that used the word anemia.

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Literally, what is the worst that can happen

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
from your kids learning swear words?

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They will save them.

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They'll make you uncomfortable by saying them.

373
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's literally the only reason.

374
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's literally it.

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You even hear people who are pretty open about free speech

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
talking about how they still don't want kids saying bad swear words.

377
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But really why though?

378
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What the fuck?

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let me fucking go through this.

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think you might be in a similar boat to me on this

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
because we both grew up very proud to follow the rules.

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Proud to do what our parents said on some level.

383
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
With my family, my brother and I had a sort of pact

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that we were like we're not going to swear till we're 18.

385
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That was just the thing we said.

386
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I started breaking that in the eighth grade

387
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because I would swear at school in front of school kids

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
but I never swore at home in front of Victor and Shay

389
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
because I didn't want to let them down.

390
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Neither of them started swearing till they were 18.

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They just kept to it the whole way

392
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
whereas I was a piece of shit and broke it early.

393
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The thing is we knew the swear words from childhood

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
because my parents had showed us Beavis and Butthead

395
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and South Park when we were little.

396
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I knew all the swears and I used to swear when I was a kid.

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But when I was going into elementary school,

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
my parents were just like,

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
yeah, this word, this word, this word,

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
don't say those at school.

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was like, okay, because I was a well-mannered kid.

402
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I just didn't say those words except for it.

403
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I wouldn't even say them at home eventually

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
because we decided we weren't going to swear

405
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because we wanted to be good kids.

406
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Once we were all 18, we just started swearing constantly

407
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
because we all know the words.

408
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
My parents swear constantly as it is.

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They weren't protecting us from it.

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's how we think.

411
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And the consequences of this have been

412
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
literally nothing because everyone swears all the time.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It doesn't fucking matter.

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I was just thinking about that.

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm curious about the whole black market of swears

416
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
in school meta is you're not allowed to say this

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and then kids would be like, fuck.

418
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then everyone would be like, hmm.

419
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And I'm like, if it's swear words,

420
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
would kids come up with words that are banned

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
or would they just secretly...

422
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There's always things that you're not allowed to say.

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If it's not swear words,

424
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
would it be something else that they would be like

425
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
to show how cool they are?

426
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The answer is yes because me and my brothers,

427
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in replacement of all the swear words,

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we just said things that were similar,

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
which the funny thing is that the things that we said

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
in place of them could get us in trouble

431
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
in some of our friends' houses or at school.

432
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We would say heck or frick or freak.

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dude, what the freak?

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Exactly, the famous dude with the freak brother.

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You said that in one of the early videos in your old channel.

436
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Dude, what the freak?

437
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, because we were under 18 when we made those videos,

438
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
so we didn't swear at any of them

439
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
because we were going to show them to our parents.

440
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We didn't want them to see us swearing or anything.

441
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We just wouldn't swear even in the content.

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But the words we were using,

443
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I would go to friends' houses and they'd be like,

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you can't say that word.

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They function like saying the N word.

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They work in the exact same way.

447
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Exactly, but it's like,

448
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you can't avoid having a word for those situations

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
because that's how you learn to talk.

450
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's how normal people speak and how the media strikes.

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're absolutely right, but let me ask you a question real quick, everybody.

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If I go up to a black person and I say,

453
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you fucking N word,

454
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
how, like, do I win?

455
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Do I get off scot-free for saying these things?

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like, I did not work.

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I win, right?

458
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Is this just the racial slur podcast?

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, I feel like we're focusing a little too heavily.

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Literally everything that you talked about,

461
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I want to say a thing about.

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Other families, other things you can't say.

463
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
For example, white trash.

464
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I am doing a fucking favor

465
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
for a family of a friend of mine, right?

466
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm driving them to a place

467
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
for, like, a really important thing

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and no one else is willing to help them.

469
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm taking time out of my day to fucking do this shit.

470
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I tell a white trash joke, right?

471
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And I guess it's more or less

472
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
at the expense of their family,

473
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
but, like, my family and me

474
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
we're all equal levels of white trash.

475
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We're all, like, pseudo-voromazurians over here.

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I didn't think of it as, like, a thing,

477
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but, like, I guess they were a little bit quiet

478
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and then my friend was like,

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that wasn't appropriate when we were alone.

480
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I'm like, you fucking nigger.

481
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm helping you people fucking out

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
on the one fucking driving.

483
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And according to other people who I've spoken to

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in my life, if you're driving,

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you set the fucking rules for all fucking speech.

486
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's the first one.

487
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want to respond to Ben, though.

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Ben, the reason I think that

489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
our kind of first trajectory...

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Real quick, to just piggyback on what he said

491
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
just a little bit, I absolutely agree.

492
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Anybody who talks shit about you

493
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
when you're doing them a favor can get fucked.

494
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, of course. Absolutely.

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Especially if you're, like, shitting on my music

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
when I'm driving you around.

497
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I then confronted my friend on that

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
about calling that inappropriate.

499
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was just saying it was offensive to them.

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm like, look, I'm fucking triggered

501
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
by the word inappropriate.

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's my fucking trigger.

503
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because, like, being a well-mannered child

504
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
generally, the only thing

505
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
my dad would ever get me on

506
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
would be, like, overreacting to something

507
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
or inappropriate something.

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So anytime anyone uses those words,

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you have a times 20 chance of pissing me off.

510
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Just a fucking record.

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Just a fucking, you know...

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Now everyone on the internet is going to be like,

513
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
hey, Davoo, you feeling inappropriate today?

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey, but

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what Ben was saying about race, I think this ties into...

516
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, Ben has a lot to say about race.

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Let me tell you.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait, no.

519
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But this is what I was going to say.

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The reason that I think that's our

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
place to start with this is because

522
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
what exactly is

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a swear or something that you can't say?

524
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's like, they're like

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
basically a crass way of

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
referring to a forbidden topic.

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So, for example, like,

528
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
nigger, racial...

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
whatever, like WAP, grease ball, etc.

530
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
All these, they imply

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
racism, and really that's what's

532
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
not acceptable, and that's perfectly reasonable.

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to let everyone know that this is

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
literally the most

535
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
alt-right podcast we've ever made.

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's not even true.

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Dude, no.

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I have an answer to this question.

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
In an academic way, but like...

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know.

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Fast and loose.

542
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Stand-up comedian David Crow postulates

543
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that swears have a lot to do with their phonetics

544
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
more than just their semantics.

545
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So, for example, like...

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It feels like you're getting whipped

547
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
by someone else's mouth, whereas if you just say

548
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
sex, it's just a little bit more

549
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
harmless or like...

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Ben's right that we don't need to focus specifically

551
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
on swear so much. I need to jump back to that

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
alt-right comment that Munchie made, because

553
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I seem to remember where, like,

554
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
ten years ago, this was

555
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
literally the entire Louis C.K.

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
stand-up routine, and every

557
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
liberal was behind him.

558
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, we know what that boy was up to in those days.

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He went back on a lot of it.

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He became a fucking Libcuck because

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that's where culture went.

563
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But, like, that, like, literally

564
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the stuff I was saying earlier about the N-word

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
thing was literally a bit he did.

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I mean, we stayed the same, and the Overton

567
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
window has shifted around us, but...

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I was thinking a lot, Digi,

569
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
about how the internet, like,

570
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
used to be pretty liberal in a lot of ways.

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Like, you think...

572
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like, French women was always, like,

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
portrayed as conservative, but they did...

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They had a lot of, like, Libcuck...

575
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They were not conservative until recently.

576
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah.

577
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Look, I haven't been on the internet

578
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
for the longest around here, but I've been...

579
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think I've probably frequented politics

580
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
boards for, like, longer than most people.

581
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uh, like, so starting

582
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
in, like, you know, 2007-ish

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I would go to the politics boards, and I'd be the

584
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
only non-liberal there every single fucking time.

585
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Sure.

586
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What changed was the social justice war.

587
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That, as far as I can tell, from my own

588
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
my own anecdotal perspective,

589
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
single-handedly shifted everything.

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's because there were no millennial conservatives

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
until we had it, until they had an enemy.

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It said we, but I'm not one of them.

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Right, exactly.

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So what it was was, originally, the demographics

595
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
on politics, at least on, you know,

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
pop-media boards where I would go,

597
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm sure there was plenty of conservative, dedicated websites,

598
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
but, like, you know, like, the tig-w-tig forums

599
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or, like, the escapist forums,

600
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the screw-attack forums, it was always, like,

601
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
it was always, the only demographic

602
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
politically was just Democrat voting liberals.

603
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like, generally people who you would describe

604
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
as pretty blue-pilled, right?

605
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I guess particularly because I was in gaming communities,

606
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and at that time, it was all about

607
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Jack Thompson and Fox News.

608
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Those were the enemies, both conservatives,

609
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
both Republicans, right?

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I mean, yeah.

611
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But then gaming started attacking itself

612
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
from within, Sarkeesian style,

613
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and all of a sudden, the demographics split wide open.

614
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now we have far more hardcore liberals,

615
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and then we have the alt-right people

616
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
who are still sort of, like, center-right,

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
because they're not, like, Christian, they're not, like,

618
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
fucking, they're not, like, Ted Cruz conservative,

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but they're more, like, Trump conservative.

620
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And then it just seems like the whole, like,

621
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
blue-pilled, mild-mannered Democratic liberals

622
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
just don't even exist among my generation anymore.

623
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It just sort of split those two ways.

624
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
What I think happened, because, like,

625
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I grew up super liberal, and, you know,

626
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
my mom raised me on, like, political music and stuff,

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and back in the 2000s,

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the reason that everyone online was liberal

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
was that being conservative meant being pro-war.

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Like, Bush had taken us to war,

631
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and, like, the platform of liberals was anti-war.

632
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We wanted peace, we wanted, and, like, pro-abortion,

633
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
pro, like, stuff like that.

634
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But once the war was no longer the big concern,

635
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because, like, well, both sides are equally likely

636
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to go to war, so, like, we don't, like,

637
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
now that it's, like, an identitarian conflict,

638
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and, like, there's a whole young generation

639
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
who's, like, well, you know, yeah,

640
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we will back the Republicans, because they're not arguing for war.

641
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They're just arguing for not this stuff that we don't like.

642
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Right. No.

643
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Fun fact, I learned from Free Domain Radio,

644
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Barack Obama was the only president in U.S. history,

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I believe, unless I misheard this fact,

646
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the only president in U.S. history to have war going on

647
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
when he took office and war still continuing when he left office.

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You could argue, though, that that's just because, again,

649
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
he is, like, a replaceable tool

650
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
who was just put in place, and, like, the machinery around him

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
just continued to operate.

652
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, that's it. That's why nobody cares, like,

653
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
nobody cares about being liberal anymore,

654
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because it doesn't seem like, it doesn't say,

655
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
it doesn't stop anything.

656
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Like, when, like, people were so angry when he, like,

657
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
won both elections, like, you know,

658
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
you had Eminem making songs about it

659
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and all this shit and all these people,

660
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and then, like, we finally got a Democratic president

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and it didn't end the war.

662
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So it's, like, why be Democrat at this point?

663
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Every one of the fucking Nobel Peace Prize,

664
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like, to remind everybody of that.

665
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
If I remember correctly, one of the things people wanted

666
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
was to stop the drug war, and all Obama did was

667
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
minimize mandatory minimum sentences,

668
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but nothing else.

669
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The fucking war on drugs continued completely.

670
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world.

671
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, yeah, all that shit continues.

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, hey, guys, let's...

673
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about,

674
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
but listen, guys, let's actually, we've been danced around.

675
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's get to the real topic.

676
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The limits of free speech.

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Margie, did you want to comment on this?

678
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I just want to say on the subject of the Internet

679
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
being more liberal, just something really illuminative

680
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
was in the Parkour Dude 91 saga.

681
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Renowned liberal.

682
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
One of the main, like, enemies of Parkour Dude 91

683
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
was this guy, Fly Away Now,

684
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and Fly Away Now during the legendary trial

685
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
of Parkour Dude 91.

686
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
One of his main problems was,

687
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Jace, you are racist, and that's not good.

688
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And so he went in hard on critiquing Jace's racism,

689
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
which is a thing that I don't think could happen nowadays.

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't think anyone would...

691
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Would portray a racist...

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No, Four Context.

693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Fly Away Now is a member of a trolling cult.

694
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's like a four-chan trolling cult.

695
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Was this sincere criticism, or was it a joke?

696
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He's saying that a troll would never use that

697
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
as a weapon against somebody now,

698
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
because being seen as racist would be seen as like,

699
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that's what the trolls are now,

700
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is that they use racism themselves.

701
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I mean, that's sort of like that guerrilla mindset guy

702
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
will call people pedophiles, despite...

703
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I don't mean to imply that four-chants

704
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
never been racist or edgy or anything.

705
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think there's been undertones of the Scientology activism

706
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and stuff like that, and there's always been

707
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
jokes about fucked news or whatever the hell.

708
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So, I don't know.

709
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I just think it's an interesting change in the world.

710
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, thanks.

711
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So yeah, limits on free speech.

712
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I was talking with that with the wife,

713
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and being all like, oh yeah,

714
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
because then there was the obvious yelling fire

715
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
in a crowded theater argument,

716
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and she told me, I didn't research this,

717
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I never researched anything because research is bullshit

718
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
because everyone says different things.

719
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
She said that she's heard that that argument

720
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
was concocted during the First World War

721
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to minimize and delegitimize anyone

722
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
who protested the war in a crowded theater.

723
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Sorry, which argument is this that was diminished?

724
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The yelling fire in a crowded theater.

725
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, okay, okay.

726
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That they're saying, we need to stop the war.

727
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then other people are like, you need to be silent.

728
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
To which they'd be like, oh, free speech bitch,

729
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
this is America.

730
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
To which other people said, no,

731
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
what you're doing isn't free speech.

732
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's like yelling fire in a crowded theater.

733
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Well, I mean, okay, let's...

734
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So that's an example of the yelling fire

735
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
in a crowded theater where there's some action

736
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
that's happening and you're compelling people

737
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
to take an action based on false information.

738
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So if there actually was a fire

739
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and you yell fire in a crowded theater,

740
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that is a reasonable thing to do.

741
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's less about that you can't speak,

742
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
but it's more about that you take responsibility

743
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
for what happens as a result of the speech.

744
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
For example, if you tell someone,

745
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
come here for free cupcakes

746
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and then you don't give anyone free cupcakes,

747
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
or buy a cake and get a free cupcake,

748
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then you don't give it.

749
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's false advertising.

750
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, that's false advertising.

751
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The difference is that it's not the fact

752
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that you've said the word fire.

753
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Your intention is to sow chaos.

754
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's true.

755
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Your intention is to make people do bad things.

756
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Unfortunately, when it comes to this,

757
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
if someone is just talking to their friend

758
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and they say, yeah, so you know,

759
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
me and my friends are gonna have a bonfire tomorrow,

760
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
if you say that in a movie theater, obviously you're fine.

761
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If someone says it but just yells the word fire

762
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and starts running around screaming,

763
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
different intentions, obviously.

764
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
All we can do is we need a court system

765
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
to just figure out what was the intention

766
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
we had in the court system.

767
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What if the guy was

768
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
mentally unsound

769
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and just yelled fire

770
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
because that's what he does?

771
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Well, then we just take it case by case.

772
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
If he couldn't help it, then we probably

773
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
shouldn't let this guy hang out in theaters.

774
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The thing is with free speech is that

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
if we could take it case by case,

776
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
people would prefer that

777
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
because it is

778
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
a lot of these things,

779
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
you can't just ban a word

780
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and have it fix all the problems.

781
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
People are gonna find ways to get around it.

782
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's always gonna be

783
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
people

784
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
scouting the system and stuff.

785
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We do do it case by case.

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That's what the court system is for.

787
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
If you scream fire in a theater,

788
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you would go to trial.

789
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
People, I guess,

790
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
okay.

791
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know anything about anything, actually.

792
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't know anything about justice.

793
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I used to think

794
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
free speech was like

795
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you can say anything you want

796
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and if people try to silence you, that means they're wrong.

797
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You don't have that in Britain?

798
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That shouldn't be there anymore.

799
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, never was, I don't think.

800
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Free speech is not codified in law.

801
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
They do have nowhere near the kind of freedoms

802
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we have in America in Britain.

803
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay, well, USA.

804
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
For what it's worth.

805
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Wait, I'm sorry.

806
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I think it was finishing this point.

807
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm sorry.

808
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't know.

809
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I didn't think he had any more point.

810
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I had a bit of a point.

811
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I was trying to rescue him.

812
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The reason that USA

813
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
has its first amendment

814
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
was because we wanted to protect

815
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
your ability to talk shit about the government.

816
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Right, that was the whole point.

817
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We did that.

818
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Talking shit about the government

819
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is how we started the revolution.

820
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That was the whole point was that we

821
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
talked their government until everybody got pissed off

822
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and then we fought them and became our own people.

823
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I can do that.

824
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, they changed the rules over time.

825
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You can.

826
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
They do have freedom of speech in Europe now,

827
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but not

828
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
necessarily to the same extent.

829
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Here's what he was thinking about.

830
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
When YouTube rolled out its whole

831
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
we're going to just bury

832
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
videos that are hateful

833
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and racist and misleading and shit.

834
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I remember thinking

835
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that they're saying it's free speech.

836
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You just can't have speech as hateful

837
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and racist.

838
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I think that the whole idea

839
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
of the Enlightenment era free speech

840
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
revolution is that you can say

841
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
anything, even things that are

842
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
hateful and harmful.

843
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You can't say things as long as they're nice.

844
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Probably dates back to thousands of years.

845
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The purpose of 10 years in universities

846
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is that professors have the freedom

847
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
to pursue academic pursuits

848
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that challenge mainstream ideas

849
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
exactly for these kinds of reasons.

850
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, exactly. I don't get why people are

851
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
typically offended when they see something

852
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that contradicts them.

853
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
For me, the moment I hear something

854
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that goes against my perception,

855
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm fucking excited. It's like my favorite

856
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
time of the day. It makes my fucking month.

857
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I personally don't feel

858
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
like I have enough ego

859
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to say that I just love

860
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
things that fundamentally challenge my world view.

861
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I am a weak human being

862
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
who's entrenched in his own biases

863
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
like everybody else.

864
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Except for DeVue.

865
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
DeVue is the one exception here.

866
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I do want to say DeVue is legitimately an exception.

867
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
DeVue legitimately

868
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and not naming. I have watched this man change

869
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
his entire mind at the drop

870
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
of a fucking pin.

871
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm not saying that's necessarily a great thing to do either.

872
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You even were able to accept your fucking

873
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
incorrect fucking metaphor

874
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
in an idiom fusion that you do.

875
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You were able to fix yourself on that.

876
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Congratulations.

877
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
To put a point on it, this is the question.

878
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Is hate speech

879
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
free speech?

880
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's the biggest question right now.

881
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think definitely yes

882
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
because

883
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
hate speech is determined

884
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
by the people who are getting offended.

885
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That's right.

886
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Let's say, for example, if

887
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
in a liberal government

888
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
liberals

889
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
they would change

890
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the law in some way

891
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and it would be like, okay,

892
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
if you cause offense you're going to jail

893
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and then somewhere down the line

894
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the people who put that law in place

895
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
are now technically offensive

896
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to a majority that's sprung up

897
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and then they would go to jail

898
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and it just feels like a stupid thing to put into place.

899
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The idea that

900
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
some sort of vague

901
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because it's an ever-shifting

902
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
what is offensive to who

903
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
depends on who's around and how many of them there are.

904
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's true.

905
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Should the government be in the business of determining

906
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
what's hate speech and what's not?

907
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Ben, if you want to comment, feel free.

908
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You can't base law on opinions.

909
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I guess you kind of can.

910
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You know what?

911
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I think the problem is that

912
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
people are so worried about

913
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the type of speech

914
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
instead of where it's being used.

915
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's say I have a private blog

916
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
where I am constantly

917
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
saying racist shit

918
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and I just share it with my friends.

919
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let's say it's on Facebook.

920
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
If Facebook finds this thing

921
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
they're going to delete it

922
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
because it's against their policy

923
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
even though it's private and it's just among me and friends

924
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and it's not aggressing against anyone

925
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
it's just me expressing my beliefs

926
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that are extremely unpopular

927
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and even if I personally think

928
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
people shouldn't have the beliefs that

929
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
this person has, why am I the moral authority?

930
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's against the policy

931
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
on what we built this country on

932
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that no one has moral authority.

933
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's the point.

934
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
How about fucking Hulk Hogan

935
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
who just was filmed

936
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
against his will?

937
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
He said the word nigger in private

938
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to someone.

939
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Watch Jesse's video

940
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
for the full discussion of that.

941
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I've been curious about this

942
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
but I couldn't really find

943
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
a definitive answer

944
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and I was also scared of googling it

945
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
in case the Google comes to get me.

946
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Is it

947
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
illegal to be racist

948
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
just actually?

949
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
No, not in America.

950
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Absolutely not.

951
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You can be as racist as you like

952
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
but if you say anything

953
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
then it becomes a problem.

954
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I want to as an example

955
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
lay a ground rule of something I think

956
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and I want to hear you guys' opinion on this

957
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
because to me

958
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I've always taken free speech and everything

959
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
really in life as the rule

960
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
of I can swing my fist as much

961
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
as I want but if I hit your face

962
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
then it's a problem basically.

963
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That was one of the founding fathers said

964
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that I don't remember who.

965
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That was the idea of

966
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
what the law was based on in this country

967
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
was that you can do

968
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
literally whatever you want but the second that it

969
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
hurts somebody else, that's when you're in trouble.

970
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The problem is what constitutes violence

971
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
does need to be.

972
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The problem also is that like

973
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
where is the line on personal responsibility

974
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
if I am writing a blog

975
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
that's like I hate black people

976
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the blog, at what point

977
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
is it that I am aggressing you

978
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
by writing things that offend black people

979
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and at what point it is yeah but you chose

980
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
to read it. Now if I was

981
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
let's say that I

982
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
go on someone's blog

983
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and this is a personal blog and I think

984
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that internet websites

985
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that you own should be respected as

986
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
private property. Of course

987
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
private property. That you invite people on to

988
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
essentially because I mean you pay for it

989
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you literally buy hosting, you buy a domain

990
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
it's your intellectual property

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you have control over what gets posted there

992
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
let's say that you

993
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
get someone who's like

994
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm a black writer and this guy

995
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
is calling me a nigger every day

996
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
in my comments so I P-ban him

997
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
this guy creates

998
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
a new account on a new computer, shows up again

999
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and continues doing it

1000
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
at that point I would consider this an act of

1001
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
aggression. Like this

1002
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
person has been not only are they

1003
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
doing something that they know is offensive

1004
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
they've been told that it's offensive

1005
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
they've been kicked off the platform

1006
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and they've circumvented the system

1007
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
in order to find a way to continue

1008
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
fucking with me. At this point there's nothing

1009
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I can do because this person's gotten around

1010
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
the tools that I have at my disposal

1011
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to defend myself so this is where

1012
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I should be able to say to the police

1013
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
hey this guy is like

1014
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
creating multiple accounts to

1015
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
continue a harassment campaign against me

1016
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
this is clearly harassment

1017
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I think I would agree

1018
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Internet harassment in general is something that

1019
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
where harassment becomes not free

1020
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
speech that is sort of a line under itself

1021
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
which is part of the reason I wanted to start this podcast

1022
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
for but also in general

1023
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
people do need to understand

1024
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that internet harassment is real

1025
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
harassment for the simple fact that

1026
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
when you get a message from someone

1027
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that's directed at you

1028
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
do you think

1029
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
hmm those are some slightly

1030
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
less colored pixels on this screen

1031
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
forming words that mean nothing

1032
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or do you think

1033
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
hmm a person

1034
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
has said a thing

1035
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to me. Well that was

1036
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
what I was trying to say earlier like I used to

1037
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
like when I was a young boy I was all

1038
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
for like free speech means you

1039
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
can say whatever you want in like

1040
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
no nothing should be banned

1041
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and you should be able to say whatever you like

1042
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
but like as the years go on

1043
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I do recognize that

1044
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
there's nuance to all things

1045
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and especially this

1046
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the context and the intent

1047
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is very important to understand in any situation

1048
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
yep

1049
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
let's say you have a number of friends

1050
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
let's say you have like almost all of your friends

1051
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
however many you have if you have none imagine you have

1052
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
12 friends imagine if 10 of your friends

1053
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
sent you a letter

1054
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
all saying that they don't want to be your friend anymore

1055
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and they hate you and they list

1056
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
very specific things that you actually

1057
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
do do as to why they hate you now

1058
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
will you think

1059
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
hmm this is some ink arranged

1060
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
in shapes that I can identify

1061
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
as words or are you going to be stressed

1062
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
out and upset so there you go

1063
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
speech can be

1064
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
like people saying things

1065
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and meaning things

1066
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and having harmful intents

1067
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
can constitute the building

1068
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
blocks that can create the bridge of harassment

1069
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and it can be done even without words

1070
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
or physical activity

1071
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
just with digital information being transferred

1072
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to your computer it still counts as

1073
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
real communication that's why people go on social media

1074
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
all the time

1075
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I feel like I understand

1076
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
why a lot of young people

1077
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
like on the internet they get up in arms

1078
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
about like their ability to say

1079
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
whatever they want regardless of

1080
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
how it may affect others

1081
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
because of the fact that they're young and they

1082
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
all they know about like

1083
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
incorrect language is swear words

1084
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and the fact that in school it is cool

1085
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
among friends to say swear words

1086
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
because the teachers don't let you

1087
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and I feel like that they take that

1088
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
idea of like

1089
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
not allowed to say

1090
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and then they just extend it into

1091
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
like internet interactions

1092
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
without knowing that it actually hurts people

1093
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
that's a very good

1094
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
so I mean

1095
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think that we could go back and forth on these

1096
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
details all day but I think the reason

1097
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
why there's no like hard

1098
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
agreement why there hasn't been an answer to this question

1099
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is because the reality is

1100
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
like

1101
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the vagueness of this topic

1102
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
makes it basically unsolvable

1103
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
except with some vast network of specific

1104
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
investigation into each

1105
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
you know individual

1106
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
time what happens

1107
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
which it should be yeah that's what the government

1108
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
should be

1109
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
a body that exists to

1110
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
solve individual problems

1111
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that we have but because

1112
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
of the fact that this first of all country

1113
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
is way too fucking big second of all everything

1114
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
is industrialized that's the entire way we think

1115
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
of the country is mass production and like

1116
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
we just try to have everybody follow

1117
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the same broad set of rules that

1118
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
just doesn't work for

1119
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
300 million people living across

1120
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
3000 miles of fucking

1121
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
land like it doesn't make

1122
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
sense to hold everybody to the same exact

1123
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
standards and circumstances all the time

1124
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you guys already don't

1125
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah

1126
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
you guys okay there's this one example of one

1127
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
website that does internet interaction

1128
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
very interestingly

1129
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
new grounds so on new grounds

1130
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
you know the interaction

1131
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
is pretty limited you have forums you have

1132
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
direct messages and you have

1133
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
reviews right it's

1134
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
for the pretty standard you know early internet

1135
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
package but on reviews you can review

1136
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
a movie you can review a game

1137
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and once you've done the review the review is done

1138
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't think you can edit reviews

1139
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't think they've ever added in the edit

1140
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
feature and

1141
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
a the artist who

1142
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
uploaded the thing that you are reviewing

1143
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
can respond to you by making

1144
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
a creators response a single

1145
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
creators response that they themselves

1146
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
cannot edit and once they

1147
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
have written their response

1148
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
it's done and new grounds has

1149
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
responded to the tons of requests

1150
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
they've gotten to be able to respond

1151
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to their responses

1152
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
to which new grounds has said

1153
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
our philosophy is to give

1154
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the creator the last word

1155
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and I think you know

1156
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
if that were a thing that were practiced

1157
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
voluntarily

1158
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I think that that would solve a lot of harassment issues

1159
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
sort of like someone

1160
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you want to criticize some person on the internet

1161
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
you know like where does it cross the line

1162
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
from criticism to harassment you know

1163
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
maybe you just come in

1164
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you make your point you don't be

1165
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
a huge dick about it

1166
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
once you've gotten your fucking

1167
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
point out and then they've made their response

1168
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
maybe you give it a little bit of follow up

1169
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
there and then you move the fuck

1170
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
on that's sort of what I under

1171
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that's what I see as the pattern with these people

1172
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
who like get so harassed they have to like go

1173
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
fucking therapy and shit start taking pills

1174
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
it's that they might very legitimately

1175
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
fuck up on something right

1176
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
as a content creator they might actually hurt

1177
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
people and they get called out on it

1178
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and now they have to deal with it but then

1179
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
they never stop getting

1180
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
called out on it they have been forever

1181
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
banished damned to the land

1182
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
of weeping and gnashing of tweets

1183
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I've been planning to to launch

1184
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
a series for a long time

1185
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and I think I might finally do it sometime

1186
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
soon because I'm ready I've got the mental

1187
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
wherewithal to do this but I want

1188
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
to do a streaming series

1189
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
called digi bro takes on takes

1190
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
all comers and I'm just going to make

1191
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
a discord server that

1192
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
has an open season

1193
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
like like you know

1194
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
call line like anybody can join this

1195
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
server anybody can jump in the call

1196
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
but I will only activate one person at a

1197
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
time and the idea is

1198
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
if you have any problem with me

1199
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
come into this call and let's

1200
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
argue about it until you

1201
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
sound either you we've resolved

1202
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
your issue or you are

1203
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
repeating yourself and sound like an idiot

1204
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and need to be kicked out because the audience

1205
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
has decided that they don't want to hear you anymore

1206
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
you say that you can

1207
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
identify a terrible or good anime

1208
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
in just one episode

1209
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but you also say there's no such thing

1210
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
as an objective opinion

1211
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
this is a contradiction

1212
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
because reasons

1213
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
what about

1214
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
what about

1215
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
what about food

1216
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
reviews I think those should be

1217
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
illegal I don't think those should

1218
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think those should not be comfortable

1219
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
we have the only good food review

1220
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
show ever created on the face of the planet

1221
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
we have the real people clamor for

1222
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
well

1223
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think

1224
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it's discrimination against

1225
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
against bad food

1226
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because

1227
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it's wasting food and we all know

1228
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
people should be allowed

1229
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
any

1230
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
dissenting opinion because I'm pretty sure

1231
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
all of us feel the exact same way

1232
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think food reviews are fine

1233
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
not that

1234
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
not that

1235
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm about to qualify it

1236
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
that's not the issue here

1237
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it's just people shouldn't

1238
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
be allowed to find a recipe

1239
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and then do it wrong and then give the recipe

1240
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
a bad review on the internet

1241
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
because they fucking it up

1242
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
they decided

1243
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
to put fucking olive oil

1244
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
in their french onion soup

1245
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and it's not my fault it's greasy

1246
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
you fuck

1247
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
that's a reasonable

1248
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
it's not my fault

1249
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
fucking soup lover

1250
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you make a reasonable point

1251
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
about how everyone's voice

1252
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
seems equally valid

1253
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
unfortunately online

1254
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
at some point

1255
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
at some point I realized

1256
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think it was probably in the t-bap days

1257
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
at some point I realized

1258
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
that a huge percentage of the people commenting

1259
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
especially on YouTube

1260
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
are kids and I was like wait a minute

1261
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
wait a minute

1262
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
these aren't full people

1263
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't need to think

1264
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't necessarily need to give

1265
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
these opinions

1266
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
being expressed in the comments

1267
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the weight that I would to an actual

1268
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
you just caught on to that

1269
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I caught on to that back then

1270
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I had this realization at some point

1271
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
in my YouTube career

1272
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
my default kind of thing to do when I

1273
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
read a comment is always to project

1274
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
my situation onto them

1275
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
they are the same age as me

1276
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
they are the same intellectual level

1277
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
we gotta avoid that though

1278
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I imagine that

1279
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
every commenter I respond to

1280
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I just think

1281
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
this is a dumb 12 year old

1282
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
even if it's a good commenter who I love

1283
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I just think

1284
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
or an amazing 9 year old

1285
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
yeah

1286
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
anyone who leaves me

1287
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
constant loving comments

1288
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
about how great I am

1289
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
nobody can be this big of a fan of me

1290
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
if you're above the age of 12

1291
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
if they're someone who bashes on me

1292
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm like no one can care this much about

1293
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
shitting on an internet creator unless they're 12

1294
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
as Endless just said

1295
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
in fact it is true that most of these people

1296
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
are kids the problem is that some of these kids

1297
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
are 35 years old

1298
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
now I will say I found one of them

1299
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
in person recently

1300
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean I assume I'm being pretty discriminatory

1301
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
but someone who I'm pretty sure is an internet

1302
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
commenter

1303
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I passed them on the side

1304
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
he just looked like

1305
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
you know he was gonna

1306
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
comment

1307
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
he was all geared up to go back to his house

1308
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
the tips of his finger

1309
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
his fingers were weathered

1310
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
guys he was wearing a cod shirt

1311
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
so that's a pretty good sign

1312
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
so he's like probably 5 foot 6 or so

1313
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you know stout portly

1314
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
like a really squished looking face

1315
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
he's got that sort of like

1316
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
shaved head thing but he doesn't shave it

1317
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
consistently

1318
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you're just describing every 35 year old

1319
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
youtube commenter that I've met

1320
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
exactly

1321
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and he has like you know dinky little glasses

1322
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and he just sort of walks with like a little bit

1323
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you know just kind of like walks a little bit

1324
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
goofily and most importantly

1325
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
of all he's wearing a call of duty ghost

1326
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
shirt which is like the least popular call of duty

1327
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
so I'm just like oh yeah

1328
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
this is a guy who like has some specific opinions

1329
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and I'm just like yeah

1330
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Davoo cradles

1331
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
his chin and his fingers

1332
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
this is a guy

1333
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
this guy thinks individual thoughts

1334
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
individual ideas

1335
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
the mad man

1336
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
if it was a modern warfare 3 shirt

1337
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'd be like okay he could just be a normie gamer

1338
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
but a ghost shirt that's too specific

1339
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
so I can feel

1340
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the opinions coming from him

1341
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
what if he's just a normal guy

1342
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
doing his normal programming job

1343
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and he just really liked modern warfare

1344
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and he pre-ordered ghost because he was super hype

1345
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and didn't know he thought the dog was gonna be dope

1346
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
but he's wearing it right now

1347
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because he spent a lot of money

1348
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
like special edition that came with the shirt

1349
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and he just I gotta get my money's worth

1350
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this is just how I'm wired dad taught me

1351
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to use everything I spent my money on

1352
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I feel like that way about certain shirts

1353
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
but I wear them indoors

1354
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
wait so did Davoo talk to a guy or not

1355
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
yeah what happened

1356
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
okay I gotta tell you about my guy who's similar

1357
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
at the airport

1358
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
yeah you tweeted about this man

1359
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
for anybody who missed my tweets this was legendary

1360
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
so me and May

1361
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
were at the airport going back to

1362
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Rochester

1363
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
from my hometown Virginia Beach

1364
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and like just some random college dude

1365
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
had sat across from us

1366
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and was asking about my shirt

1367
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because I was wearing a Gintama shirt and he thought it was a bleach shirt

1368
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and I was explaining

1369
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I was explaining to him that it was a parody of

1370
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
bleach and he was just like

1371
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
he just got like oh you guys into anime

1372
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and she was like yeah we're anime

1373
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
YouTubers we're like it's our job

1374
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
we always do is watch anime

1375
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
we get into this whole anime

1376
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
so we're talking to this guy for a while

1377
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
we're making him a fan basically he's like

1378
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
way excited to hear about anime

1379
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
he's like a 20 year old college dude

1380
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
but there's another guy

1381
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
who's like sitting across the way

1382
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
who's like a big fat guy

1383
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
in a Ninja Turtles t-shirt

1384
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
when we had first gotten

1385
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
to the airport terminal I saw this guy

1386
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and I thought if anyone here would recognize me

1387
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it would be that guy it's like what I'm thinking

1388
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
when I look at this guy

1389
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
so we're just talking about anime

1390
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
for like probably 15 minutes

1391
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and then everybody gets up to go in the line

1392
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and the fat guy comes over and he's like

1393
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
hey I heard you guys talking about anime

1394
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
you know I wasn't sure if I should jump into the conversation

1395
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
or whatever right

1396
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and he's like yeah I'm like

1397
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
okay so the other dude like clearly had been

1398
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
watching like everything on crunchyroll

1399
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
just like whatever showed up on crunchyroll

1400
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
he was giving it a shot this fat guy has just seen

1401
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I fucking hate people that watch anime

1402
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
this fat guy has just

1403
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
exclusively seen Attack on Titan

1404
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and that is it but he comes up

1405
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and he's like yeah you know

1406
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I really like I was really into death note

1407
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
you know because I think

1408
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
it's like a perfect mirror reflection of like

1409
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
the Lion King

1410
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
because you know

1411
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
what the fuck

1412
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and then he's like well because you know first

1413
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
he's like each character is like parallel

1414
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
so first you've got like light who wants to be

1415
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
god just like Simba

1416
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and after he said that

1417
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
my brain went like

1418
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
like all the juice drained out

1419
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and I was just like dumbfounded like

1420
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I was trying not to look at him as hard as I could

1421
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
he's like

1422
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I think Ryuk was Rafiki and like

1423
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I mean he just

1424
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
basically he just compared the main characters

1425
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
of one to the main characters of others

1426
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
like light is or L is just like scar

1427
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
because he wants to stop Simba

1428
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
like

1429
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
that's the

1430
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
mark of a great story

1431
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
is that it's exactly like another story

1432
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Simba is like L

1433
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
because he's trying to stop Scar

1434
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
who's the bad evil man who took over

1435
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and seized power through illegitimate

1436
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
evil means like he's the one

1437
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
but L doesn't want to be god

1438
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Scar doesn't want to be god

1439
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Scar

1440
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
is kind of does

1441
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm sorry

1442
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
this just reminds me of a time I was in an anime convention

1443
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
where I went up to a guy wearing a samurai outfit

1444
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and I was like hey dude your gene

1445
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I love samurai shampoo and he's like actually I'm going

1446
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
on from uh you know fucking

1447
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
loop in the third and I pretended

1448
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I knew who that was at the time

1449
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
oh you didn't know who Gaimon was

1450
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I didn't know who the fuck that was at the time

1451
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
this was this was long ago but it's I've never

1452
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
forgotten it I've always been ashamed

1453
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
there's nothing worse that to your credit than getting

1454
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
a thing wrong

1455
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
especially getting like a classic wrong

1456
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
for like a modern show

1457
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
like he looks disgusted when I said I love gene

1458
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
yeah it's so cool

1459
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
at that one party

1460
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that I went to when I was at your house

1461
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
we met that one guy who went to

1462
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
some like anime cons right

1463
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
embarrassing

1464
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I don't what did he look like I don't remember

1465
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
he was a bizarre

1466
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
he was a bizarre like lantern

1467
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
looking motherfucker

1468
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
he looked like some sort of like

1469
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
portly like last lantern

1470
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
like the pokemon lantern

1471
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I don't know what you're talking about

1472
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
there's a lot of people that could fit that description

1473
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
he was talking to us about how he went to cons

1474
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
in the local area

1475
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
he was a big anime guy

1476
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and then I said yeah me and Ben are like

1477
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
stars of brony con we go there all the time

1478
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
yeah

1479
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I wish you had

1480
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm just picturing lantern the pokemon

1481
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
just like hey guys we're going to an anime convention

1482
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I do not recall that conversation even a little bit

1483
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
so okay so first amendment right

1484
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
there's one thing about that

1485
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I don't care about that anymore

1486
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
it's been a thing for me right

1487
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
let's just do another wild card episode

1488
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
what I think is

1489
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
one of the most widely held fallacies

1490
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
about specifically

1491
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
the first amendment of the constitution of the united states

1492
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
is this fallacy that

1493
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
this is going to like

1494
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
ugh I'm tensed up because I could get all y'all

1495
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
fucking jumping on my ass over this

1496
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
this perception that

1497
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
the first amendment

1498
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
only applies to

1499
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
units of individual solitary

1500
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
people

1501
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
as opposed to like corporations and what not

1502
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
well here's the thing about that right

1503
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
because the actual text

1504
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
of the first amendment is

1505
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
well hold on I'll just

1506
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
probably should have looked it up before

1507
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
first amendment

1508
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
what it says is

1509
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I gotta keep fucking coughing to get to it

1510
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
for score yeah okay

1511
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Congress shall make no law

1512
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
respecting an establishment of religion

1513
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
or prohibiting the free exercise

1514
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
thereof

1515
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
or abridging the freedom of speech

1516
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
or

1517
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
of the press

1518
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
or the right of the people to peaceably assemble

1519
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and to petition the government for our readdressive grievances

1520
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
that is a part

1521
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
like a certain like

1522
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
comma section and no one ever talks about when they talk about

1523
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the idea of free speech basically there's this idea that

1524
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
if people band together to form a corporation

1525
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
they've now voided

1526
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
their ability to speak because it's no longer a person

1527
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
now it's a company

1528
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
well that I don't think that press clause

1529
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
really covers like corporations it covers

1530
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
the press well it says the press

1531
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
which basically means like

1532
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
people who report information in the news

1533
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
group of people who say things right that's not

1534
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
like what a corporation is a corporation

1535
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
is a business a money making enterprise

1536
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I mean if you want to argue that a person

1537
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
you know should be treated like

1538
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
you know if a company should have the rights of free speech

1539
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that's probably fine I just don't think that clause

1540
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
addresses that yeah well no one

1541
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
ever no one ever brings it up though like

1542
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
like we always like doesn't come up

1543
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
when people say freedom of the press isn't that

1544
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
exactly what they're talking about

1545
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
yeah but people don't really think about it right

1546
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
because you hear people say like oh well a corporation isn't a person

1547
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
therefore they don't have free speech

1548
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it's god damn it that part is not about corporations

1549
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
it's about the god damn press

1550
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I know but like

1551
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
the press isn't a person

1552
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
yeah it's the press it's not

1553
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
okay I'm sorry what do you get

1554
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
because my feeling is that like you know

1555
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
if you team up with someone

1556
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like even the PCP isn't incorporated

1557
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
but it's not a person it's a group of multiple people

1558
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
right so I don't know it's just kind of like

1559
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
for me I just think of that as sort of a fallacy that people need to

1560
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
like I wish that

1561
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
like the way that

1562
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
publicly traded corporations work

1563
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
is obviously very very

1564
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
problematic and really should be looked at

1565
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
but then I just feel like people sort of throw out

1566
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
like the entire every single baby

1567
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
with that particular bathwater you know what I mean

1568
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think I know what you're getting at you're talking about like

1569
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
people walk around as though if you don't represent

1570
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
a single person then you don't

1571
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
really have the right to of

1572
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
expression I don't

1573
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
here's a here's a here's a thought about this so for example

1574
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Chick-fil-A just fucking

1575
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
loves Jesus down to their

1576
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
like you know Chick-fil-A doesn't

1577
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
want to give like their their female employees like birth control

1578
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and whatever there was like a thing about that

1579
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
because they like

1580
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the text they say is we have a sincerely

1581
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
held belief that like we are

1582
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
like a religious organization this is a fundamental

1583
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
principle of us and this goes against

1584
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
our religious beliefs and we don't want to be forced

1585
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
to do things that go against our beliefs and

1586
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
like I could understand someone

1587
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
being skeptical especially like an atheist who's

1588
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
like well that's obviously just a trick

1589
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
to like get away with you know

1590
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
just not having to spend more on their

1591
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
employees but the thing is I am

1592
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
100% convinced that Chick-fil-A

1593
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
is 100% sincere

1594
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
about their love of Jesus and

1595
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
even though I don't think he's you know real or whatever

1596
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I mean you know the

1597
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
thing about Chick-fil-A they close on Sunday man

1598
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
they cut off profits one seventh of the

1599
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
week you would think

1600
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
that that would be unpopular

1601
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
you would think that they would get a lot of

1602
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
backlash for that and they do

1603
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
but the thing is there is a large population

1604
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
of people who sincerely agree with them

1605
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
they might be in the minority I don't know

1606
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
they might be but there's enough of them

1607
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
that like the goodwill generated within that

1608
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
population like more than

1609
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
makes up for the fact that there are lots of people

1610
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and lots of people don't want to eat their

1611
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
shit because they're you know terrible

1612
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
you're just you're appealed to your demographic

1613
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
that's like good business

1614
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I don't think they're doing themselves any favors

1615
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
really by like because they really

1616
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
are putting themselves in the camp of like a small

1617
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
minority I would argue like

1618
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I guess I don't know the statistics

1619
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
there's like three quarters

1620
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
there's a lot of religious people in American

1621
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
most Christians are atheists in denial

1622
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I would argue especially in America

1623
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
most atheists are Christians

1624
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
why do you refuse to

1625
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
love God yet you know exist

1626
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and you've chosen to just hate

1627
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
the thing about refusing

1628
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
birth control right I think my dad

1629
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
actually agrees on me with this position

1630
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
even if a little bit like begrudgingly

1631
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
which is I think it's

1632
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
in general bullshit that you

1633
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
have to give employees like

1634
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
certain things unilaterally

1635
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
like what happens to just oh you want

1636
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
this job here's what we'll offer you

1637
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
maybe it's money maybe it's healthcare

1638
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
maybe it's this handshake agreement done

1639
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean I think both of us

1640
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
the fact is

1641
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
where the fuck were all these Christians

1642
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
like protesting the idea of

1643
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
you have to give every employee a certain amount of healthcare

1644
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
a certain amount of dental based on certain you know random

1645
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
bullshit back before it became

1646
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
religiously controversial right

1647
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
like Christians should have been on their fucking toes

1648
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
to realize oh shit if we're allowing

1649
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
way back in like the FDR

1650
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and LBJ era for

1651
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the government to force you to give certain things

1652
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
to your employees that could be turned

1653
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
against us I don't think they did back then though

1654
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I think that the reason it's become an issue

1655
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
is because like as things

1656
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
move in a more progressive direction

1657
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
in some aspects of American life

1658
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like the idea of how contraception

1659
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
should be because it's like you know

1660
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
you can make an argument it's part of women's biology

1661
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and healthcare now they've added on

1662
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
yeah now they've added on birth control

1663
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and like abortion onto it

1664
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
well I don't think it's wrong

1665
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I don't think you should be able to have a get out of

1666
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
get out of benefit

1667
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
free clause because you don't believe in abortion

1668
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I just feel like everyone shouldn't have to be

1669
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
giving certain people certain things outside of

1670
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
like a simple contract

1671
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
between employer and employer

1672
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I mean me personally I don't think

1673
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
any company should be giving contraception

1674
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
because like it's not a mandatory thing

1675
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
like don't fucking

1676
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
yeah like abstinence is 100% effective

1677
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
you know I mean that's

1678
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't know

1679
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I mean if it's that's like

1680
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
if that's a thing that would be covered by health insurance

1681
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
like birth control is

1682
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
is covered by health insurance and jobs

1683
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
provide health insurance so why wouldn't

1684
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I know this is an extreme example but just for the

1685
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
for the intelligent

1686
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
reflection of this principle

1687
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it's like so like what if I am one of

1688
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
these people who what do they call them the people who are like

1689
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
into getting viruses and into getting diseases

1690
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
bug catchers

1691
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't know

1692
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm sorry bug chasers

1693
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
if I'm a bug chaser and let's just say

1694
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
that I go get AIDS because I really want

1695
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
AIDS and I'm into that like is it

1696
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
then the company's responsibility to pay

1697
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
for that because now it's

1698
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
a medical issue

1699
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and it just did the same way I would argue

1700
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
that you have exactly as much agency

1701
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
to not have a child and need

1702
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
you know an abort you know

1703
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
contraception or whatever

1704
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
well I know it's

1705
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I don't know you have

1706
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
agency in lots of things like

1707
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
why does that mean that it shouldn't be covered by health insurance

1708
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
this is the real point though I'm with

1709
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
DeVoo and I'm really libertarian I just think

1710
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
basically companies just shouldn't do it they shouldn't

1711
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
be in the business of like giving health care

1712
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
it should just be everyone's job I don't like

1713
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
the way that health insurance

1714
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
is set up I don't like that you have to

1715
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
work for a company so that

1716
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
someone will pay for you to get

1717
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
like just give me the money I think it should

1718
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
just be available well I think it should

1719
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I mean I think it should be universal and I think everyone should

1720
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
have access to whether you fucking work for a corporation

1721
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
young people working at entry level jobs

1722
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
or trying to get jobs in the first place

1723
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
ever notice how you're totally dependent

1724
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
on your fucking job for your fucking health care

1725
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and you're definitely on your fucking insurance company

1726
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
and your hospital to get the right care

1727
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and you're responsible on your government to be able to

1728
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
take care of all your shit maybe there's a reason

1729
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
why politicians love to talk about how you

1730
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
should give people more fucking health care

1731
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
because it makes you more dependent

1732
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I just want to point out that about

1733
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
this probably applies to lots of health care issues

1734
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
but about birth control specifically

1735
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
like birth control is cheap

1736
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and children are expensive and like

1737
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
really like everybody wins

1738
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
like everybody wins if people have easy

1739
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
access to birth control

1740
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
like that's not I don't think

1741
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
like I think that that I think that providing that

1742
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
service pays for itself like a hundred

1743
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
it's only it's just that is a real practical

1744
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
concern that I am very sympathetic to

1745
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but it's just that when we do that it then

1746
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
opens up the door to this like this

1747
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Chick-fil-A type situations where

1748
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
things get messy because they really

1749
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
religiously have a problem with doing

1750
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
so who wins

1751
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
right

1752
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Christian Baker

1753
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
being requested to make a gay wedding cake

1754
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
thing I just wait I just want to

1755
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
say that I really think the problem here is with

1756
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
like the fact that health insurance is like

1757
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
a corporate responsibility

1758
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I think that's where the trouble comes in I mean you

1759
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
can get health care outside I mean I

1760
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
never have so I don't really

1761
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
know I'll find out when I quit my job one of these

1762
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
days but

1763
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
yeah that sound like your boss

1764
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
haha

1765
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
someone was just making a transition it was a topic

1766
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
interesting yeah it was

1767
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Baker being requested to make a gay wedding

1768
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
yeah oh that's a good one

1769
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
do they have to now here's my dad

1770
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
okay my dad I didn't clarify this my dad's

1771
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
like a super Christian guy got lots of like

1772
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
degrees in Bible he's like he's about to go on

1773
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
like a short missions trip actually where's it going

1774
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
where's it going

1775
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
well I thought it might be like you

1776
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
like you got there or something

1777
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
okay fine fine so

1778
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
he's going to my house

1779
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
like one of the fucking trolls

1780
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
it's going to go down into like central

1781
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
some some fan

1782
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
some fan

1783
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
some fan in like Zimbabwe

1784
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
listening

1785
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
he's like hey are you Davoo's dad

1786
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I like the difference in like

1787
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
laxness

1788
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
that we fucking have on this show we have

1789
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Davoo who's just like I can't dox

1790
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
my dad's where he's going on like the mission

1791
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
for the church and then

1792
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Digi's like Virginia Beach my hometown

1793
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you know

1794
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
that's out there that's out there

1795
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don't think a town is doxing

1796
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
he muted himself

1797
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
okay he's probably been trying to say stuff

1798
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
for getting him muted himself well maybe anyway

1799
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
so my dad did just muted himself

1800
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
oh my god

1801
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
you know it's just common courtesy to

1802
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
accept custom from people right

1803
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
so like he'll clean a gay person's

1804
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
windows for example right no no problem

1805
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
there right but he thinks

1806
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
baking that's like

1807
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
artistic expression right making a

1808
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
cake make an argument yeah is like

1809
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
something that comes from more from your soul

1810
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
right and just exist

1811
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
but yeah where like I totally

1812
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
feel that way too I thought I think it's

1813
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
ridiculous that like

1814
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that you have to be

1815
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
forced to uphold any kind of

1816
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
like right societal

1817
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
moral standard that is like the whole

1818
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
point of freedom of speech to me

1819
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
is that like and freedom

1820
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
of to be able to do whatever you want

1821
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
with your corporation is like I think

1822
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
everybody's just a pundit for the world

1823
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
that they want right like

1824
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
that we all exist

1825
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
to try to promote the world that we want

1826
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
to live in and like most

1827
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
of us disagree with each other about the

1828
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
specifics of that world like the

1829
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
amount that we agree on is where we've

1830
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
drawn the lines in our country like

1831
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the lines in the sand is where we've like we all agree

1832
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
on at least you can't kill people

1833
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
like there's some people who disagree with

1834
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
that but they are such a minority and we feel so

1835
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
strongly the opposite that we're going to make

1836
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
sure those people are not listen to

1837
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
wait wait wait what was Gibb saying

1838
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I was going to say about the gay wedding

1839
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
case thing because I heard about that way

1840
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
back when it was like relevant

1841
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
and I remember always thinking like of course

1842
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you should be allowed to refuse

1843
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
service if that's what you believe

1844
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
even though I didn't think it was a good idea

1845
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I think that the

1846
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
point is that you should have

1847
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
the freedom

1848
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
of expression to have a

1849
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
like unpopular business model

1850
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
that does badly for like

1851
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
you would do in any other situation

1852
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
like there was a situation that happened a couple

1853
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
years back that was like the inverse of this

1854
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
there are a bunch of like like super

1855
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
hardcore Christian people like

1856
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
passing out pamphlets and stuff

1857
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and like I think it was like

1858
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
like a pro-life sort of thing that they were doing

1859
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and they went to this coffee shop to like take

1860
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
a break and this guy

1861
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
comes in and screams at them

1862
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
that he's a gay guy and he disagrees with everything

1863
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
he said get the fuck out of his cafe

1864
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
we were talking about gay people don't even need a portion

1865
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and they did

1866
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and they had to leave and like

1867
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
all the same people who would like be

1868
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
you gotta make the cake were totally

1869
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
on his side kicking them out so it's just like

1870
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
that's a tough one

1871
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
that's a double standard

1872
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
would you force a Jewish baker to make a swastika cake

1873
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
to which like the rebuttal to that

1874
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
is usually oh but that would be ridiculous

1875
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
cause those are Nazis and it's like there you go

1876
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
what is actual free speech to you

1877
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
is all the things that you

1878
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
the thing is that we don't

1879
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
need the government to do anything

1880
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
about this because the free market

1881
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
will do something about it

1882
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
if you refuse

1883
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
you just go somewhere else

1884
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
if you make a statement that like you will not

1885
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
make a gay cake for anybody

1886
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
people who think that that's not okay of you

1887
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
to do will not buy from you

1888
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and you could even lose your platform

1889
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
as a store

1890
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
you have to be renting a space

1891
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
what if your realtors don't want to support your business anymore

1892
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
because they don't believe in the same things as you

1893
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
what if the people in your community

1894
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
want you driven out what if they pick it like

1895
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
you you know what if they stand in protest

1896
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
outside your store every day and you can't get any customers

1897
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
all of that's fine

1898
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
now we get back to the thing I said at the very beginning

1899
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
which is that people get into giant like

1900
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
twisters on like who's the one that broke the free speech

1901
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
you know it's like

1902
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
who's the one who crossed the line

1903
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
to censorship here right

1904
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and we need to always be very vigilant

1905
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
of when we cross the line

1906
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
into saying

1907
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
the government should do something

1908
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
about it and I think because people jump

1909
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
to that so often we should take more

1910
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
time out of our day to emphasize

1911
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
that we very specifically don't want

1912
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
the government to get in on

1913
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I feel like RazorFist just had a video about this

1914
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
with the whole

1915
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
EA gambling thing so check that out

1916
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I'll have to check that out I feel so bad

1917
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
for the word censorship

1918
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
it's really been abused these last few years

1919
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
it's really taken a beating

1920
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and it's gotten a raw deal

1921
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
censorship used to be a powerful bastion

1922
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
and like this is a criticism of guys on like

1923
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the right as well

1924
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
this isn't just like SJW

1925
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
it's like censorship is like when

1926
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
it's censorship

1927
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
when someone you know like

1928
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I don't know I can't give you an example

1929
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
when the government steps in and tells you

1930
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
when people invoke

1931
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
the government to say that

1932
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
like if you're petitioning

1933
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Obama to ban

1934
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
the word retarded

1935
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
you are advocating censorship

1936
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that was a huge movement that happened

1937
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
in the late 2000s

1938
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and you know

1939
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
funnily enough

1940
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
this goes back to what I was saying before

1941
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
about how Louis C.K. was like the bastion

1942
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
of free speech and then became a cuck

1943
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
same thing with Stephen Colbert

1944
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
he had this amazing segment where a guy

1945
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
who was doing this campaign

1946
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
to get rid of the word retarded

1947
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
had come on his show

1948
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
the entire thing and then at the very end

1949
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
turns to the audience and says alright kids

1950
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
don't say the word retarded

1951
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
it's totally gay

1952
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
this is the funniest shit I've ever heard in my life

1953
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
that's fantastic

1954
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
did you remember that?

1955
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I remember it

1956
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and now he would you know

1957
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
now he'd probably be on the total opposite side of that

1958
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
because it looks good for support

1959
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
like it looks good to just

1960
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
co-tow to whatever the gay community

1961
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
wants you to say

1962
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
AndyYoutuber who like

1963
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
got picked up by the mainstream

1964
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
and like became like a real

1965
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
just streamlined everyday vloger

1966
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
here I go

1967
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
this is a disgrace

1968
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
what he's doing right now

1969
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
god it's sickening

1970
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I used to love Colbert

1971
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I loved him

1972
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Jesus Christ

1973
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
all the money they threw at Colbert to take that job

1974
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
censorship

1975
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
that's goddamn censorship

1976
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
old hard cash

1977
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
it was immoral

1978
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
all the fucking Obama stimulus bucks

1979
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
don't trust anybody

1980
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
if someone sold out enough

1981
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
that they can run a late

1982
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
night talk show they're not worth trusting anymore

1983
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
to a degree

1984
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
so the thing that retarded right

1985
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I remember one time making a chain of tweets

1986
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
that was like two guys talking

1987
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and it was like oh man

1988
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
dude my boss

1989
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
he's totally blind to the truth

1990
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
yeah man your boss sucks

1991
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
oh dude

1992
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm in a cancerous relationship

1993
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
oh man yeah man

1994
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I hope you get out of that relationship

1995
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
oh dude my finances are just

1996
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
crippled right now

1997
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
oh man I hope you get a good break

1998
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
oh dude this guy I saw yesterday

1999
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
this joke I heard yesterday

2000
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
was retarded

2001
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
whoa hey man

2002
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
it's offensive to use real life disabilities

2003
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
as a negative insult

2004
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
but someone responded with

2005
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't know with the very cogent

2006
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
argument but I still

2007
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
that was like my favorite tweet you ever made

2008
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
with the very

2009
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
not really logical but emotionally

2010
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I understand it argument which was as follows

2011
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I don't know man saying retarded

2012
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
as an insult just seems kind of wrong

2013
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
which is simply because

2014
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
if you're retarded you're a worse person

2015
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
dude I fucking hate people

2016
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
who say shit like that because

2017
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
they just like

2018
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
literally that's complacency

2019
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
it's just oh well I don't want to think about it

2020
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm just going to do what people tell me is like

2021
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
the right thing to do

2022
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
this is the hard truth that no one wants to face

2023
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
if you're retarded you're a worse person

2024
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
because in our society we value

2025
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
who you are on the inside

2026
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
and if you're retarded you are actually

2027
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
worse at being a human being on the inside

2028
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and no one wants to face up to that

2029
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
no you're not wrong in an intellectual

2030
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
capacity way if you have a mental deficiency

2031
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
then you are less

2032
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
now to say you're a worse person than average

2033
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
this isn't if you have great moral character

2034
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I'm not trying to disagree at all but

2035
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
just for example my mom is a special education

2036
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
teacher and I would say

2037
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
retarded to her all the time

2038
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and it was very common for her to say to me

2039
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Nate like I wish you wouldn't say that

2040
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
like that's people you know

2041
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
that's a very negative thing to say

2042
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and like my kids would you know be the kind of people

2043
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I wish you wouldn't say that bitch

2044
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
how do you like them apples

2045
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
it's perfectly

2046
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I never like did that

2047
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
occasionally I would try to avoid that particular word

2048
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
for emphasis when talking to her

2049
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
cause I didn't want to hurt her feelings

2050
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
which I guess is self censorship but like

2051
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
well it's just police

2052
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I think we all are gonna

2053
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
self censorship is a good idea

2054
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
in all capacities

2055
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
not just of swear words

2056
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
or things that are obviously offensive

2057
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
censor yourself all the time for all kinds of reasons

2058
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
cause your inner

2059
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
your inner monologue is probably

2060
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
most people around you

2061
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
censorship you know even just in its usage

2062
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
right now unfortunately has this

2063
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the same sort of phenomenon that the word racist

2064
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
has had in that like so many different

2065
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
like degrees all get mixed up in one

2066
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
word and then people basically hear

2067
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
the most extreme thing when you say it

2068
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
um so like like if I

2069
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
delete someone's tweet like I

2070
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
understand that is like you are technically

2071
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
accurate to say I am sort of

2072
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
censoring them yes by the way which I like

2073
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
literally never ever do

2074
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
like that would be a fair thing to say but

2075
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
beyond that I think you are going against

2076
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
sort of the spirit of what real

2077
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
censorship and like notable censorship

2078
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
is if the if governments never

2079
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
existed but Twitter did no one

2080
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
would have thought of the word censorship as meaning anything

2081
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
all that bad I sort of yeah I basically agree

2082
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
and just incident I just really want to point out I never

2083
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
delete tweets or like

2084
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
posts or anything I like

2085
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I just leave it there I just want to

2086
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
delete tweets I want to jump back on that

2087
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
right to do so that retarded thing that

2088
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
DeVu was saying about the guy saying like oh it's

2089
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
just kind of like uncomfortable to say that

2090
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I think that is so fucking intellectually

2091
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
dishonest and it's because

2092
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
the words

2093
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
that you feel uncomfortable with are changing all the time

2094
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
it was totally different ten years

2095
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
ago we all said retarded nobody thought it was

2096
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
weird but now that people now that

2097
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
someone in your social group is not okay

2098
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
with you saying it it makes you uncomfortable

2099
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
we used to say gay and now gay is not cool

2100
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
but I still say it anyway

2101
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I think gay kind of circled

2102
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
around being cool

2103
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
this is how fucking simple I know people are

2104
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
is that people will fucking

2105
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
watch someone like that guy on the

2106
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Colbert report who will just turn up

2107
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
on TV and give you a sob story

2108
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
about why it offends him when you say

2109
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
retarded and then you'll go around to your friends

2110
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
and be like guys it's not okay to say retarded

2111
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and then you'll listen to

2112
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
some other guy some

2113
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
comedian who will give you the exact opposite

2114
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
story with a decent amount of reasoning

2115
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and you'll go oh I guess it's okay to say retarded

2116
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
again because this guy made the argument

2117
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and now I realize oh I do like saying it

2118
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
and like people are exactly

2119
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that fickle that's what the Overton window does

2120
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
is it just bounces back and forth

2121
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
between comedian this comedian

2122
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
made it okay to say gay again

2123
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
this gay guy I think like you know now

2124
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
we got Milo out there Milo

2125
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Milo's flaming gay he's

2126
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
gonna say all these words you got YMS out there

2127
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
calling people faggot all the time like

2128
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and he's like hey I do you think

2129
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm not allowed able to handle the word faggot

2130
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and fuck you and I'm like well okay

2131
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but did you the gay community has disowned

2132
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Milo they have disowned him

2133
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
they haven't disowned YMS though

2134
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
and he's you know you're right

2135
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
what's more offensive to YMS calling him a faggot

2136
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
or calling or questioning the fact that he needs

2137
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
someone else to edit his incredibly

2138
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
lazily edited quickies

2139
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
YMS please fire your quickie editor

2140
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
get somebody who can make them

2141
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
well just like the guy is editing them

2142
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
as though he's trying

2143
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
to make the worst youtube video

2144
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I mean they could be a lot better

2145
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
they're not great

2146
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I think that on this particular

2147
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
slippery slope of like these words gay and retarded

2148
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I think retarded is a little bit easier

2149
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
to justify because if you can google it

2150
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
the second definition is

2151
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
delay or hold back in terms

2152
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
of progress development

2153
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
but everyone knows what you mean when you say retarded

2154
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
no one's using that definition

2155
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
well hold on though because I actually

2156
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I don't know maybe I'm a little

2157
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
bit more literally minded than average

2158
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
possibly I kind of think of the word retarded

2159
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
as like I tend to think

2160
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
of like stupidity you know people whose brains

2161
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
aren't sure sure but if you like if you

2162
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
there's like a fan and you stop the fan with

2163
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
your fingers and then you start moving the fan in the opposite direction

2164
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
you are retarding

2165
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
the blades of the fan

2166
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
right like retarded does kind

2167
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
of also mean you're absolutely

2168
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
right that normal that word does in fact

2169
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
have a basically socially acceptable

2170
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
definition but here's the thing though

2171
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
it's just if I call you

2172
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
if I call you a faggot

2173
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
like there's really no way around the fact

2174
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
that that's simply an offensive word

2175
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
now going to gay the thing about gay

2176
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
is that the thing that we're really referring

2177
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
to is something that like I think those

2178
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
those words kind of the gay is getting

2179
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
its new meaning because of a thing

2180
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that

2181
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
is more commonly colloquially attributed

2182
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
to gay individuals

2183
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
isn't that discrimination to do that then

2184
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that is I think it like it has

2185
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
a little bit more of like a discriminatory

2186
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
or a little bit more like stereotypical

2187
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
origin and even though

2188
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
you recognize it's not all gay people

2189
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
but it's like certain traits that you can

2190
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
often see stereotypically

2191
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
at least in gay men

2192
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
most commonly

2193
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
but then a lot of people

2194
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
use the word gay me included

2195
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
as just like bad

2196
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
even though I don't feel that way about anything

2197
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
homosexual I think what a lot of people forget

2198
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
when it comes to like stereotypes and stuff

2199
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
is that we as human beings

2200
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
like to be a part of something

2201
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
we like to be stereotyped

2202
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
if it's something that we actually

2203
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
feel connected to

2204
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
there's a reason that black comedians

2205
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
constantly talk about being black

2206
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
because

2207
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
they've taken which elements of

2208
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
the stereotypical black experience

2209
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
people want to identify themselves

2210
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
with and like claimed it

2211
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
they've been like yeah this is what black

2212
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
people are because we like that

2213
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and we want to be this way

2214
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
at least for a bit

2215
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
yeah well my dick is big

2216
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
what's the line that

2217
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Kendrick sings in black or the berry

2218
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
that whole song is him rattling off all the black cliches

2219
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
that black culture

2220
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
has tried to embrace and be like

2221
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
this is the positive image we want of ourselves

2222
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
we'll invite some of the dumb shit too

2223
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
watermelon and chicken whatever

2224
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
everybody likes those things

2225
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
that's not offensive to say that we like those things

2226
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I don't really care all that much for watermelon

2227
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
although I will say just like the other day

2228
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that girl chasing a chicken around

2229
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
that was kind of offensive

2230
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
is there such a thing as inner blackface

2231
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
because I think you've got it didgy

2232
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I definitely have inner I've got some kind of weird

2233
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
concoction

2234
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I only interpret the world through black and Japanese

2235
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
media like all I consume

2236
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
is black and Japanese media so I don't

2237
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
even know what white people are up to

2238
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
because I can't listen to country

2239
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I can't do it

2240
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
did you ever heard

2241
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
but me hippo and Ben

2242
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I don't know if I heard correctly it's about how y'all

2243
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
is a black word

2244
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
y'all is just a southern word

2245
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
everyone in the south says y'all

2246
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
but also the people are black now

2247
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
well okay

2248
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
sure

2249
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
you know Thomas soul doesn't just

2250
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
do business in economics he also does black history

2251
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
shit right he has a book called

2252
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
it's a stupid title but it was

2253
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
actually fucking reviewed by it better than food book reviews

2254
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
black rednecks and white liberals

2255
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
in which like his findings

2256
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
that the southern culture and southern accent

2257
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
all got sparked

2258
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
by northern Britain

2259
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
like those are the ones who moved to the south

2260
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
in America and that's where the

2261
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
accent evolved into the southern accent

2262
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and then that southern accent

2263
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and southern sensibilities were taken

2264
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
where then you know that's where most of the black slaves

2265
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
were and then they immigrated northwards

2266
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and then that's where sort of the modern

2267
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
racism situation so what you're telling

2268
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
me is that Gibb is

2269
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
a slave holder that's what I'm hearing

2270
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
southern UK

2271
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
oh shit well

2272
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and in most countries north is where

2273
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
the fucking boondock stuff

2274
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
the funny thing about the east coast is that it's

2275
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
like especially with black people it's all

2276
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
very interconnected and there's lots of

2277
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
emigration around

2278
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
most of the people I knew in Virginia

2279
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
in Virginia period

2280
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
were from New York and like

2281
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
so people constantly like transport

2282
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
like between the south

2283
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
like Georgia and Virginia where the cost

2284
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
of living is a lot lower than New York

2285
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
cause New York is like crazy overpopulated

2286
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and like the cost of living

2287
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
is insanely high to have like a tiny shit hole

2288
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
apartment so like people who can only afford

2289
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
to live in like a one room apartment in New York

2290
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
will just like get all their shit together

2291
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
into a fucking car

2292
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and just like abandon as much as they

2293
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
can and just hail Mary

2294
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
down south when they have kids

2295
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
so that they can raise their kids in a house

2296
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
so like that's where literally like

2297
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
half of all the black people in the south

2298
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
like come from it's just like New Yorkers

2299
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
who flee down to have kids

2300
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
and then eventually a lot of those kids go back

2301
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
up to New York cause they need jobs

2302
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
you know? Is this like the fucking penguins

2303
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
or certain like breeds of fish that like

2304
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
go back and forth for mating seasons?

2305
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Is that what we are? Is that one of the things

2306
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
of it's black people is penguins? I mean it's not just

2307
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
black people but that's just like the majority

2308
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
of who's in like the burrows in New York

2309
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
you know like white people are doing the same shit

2310
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
but it's just poor the poor are

2311
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
doing this. I can't believe it we're fucking

2312
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
penguins this is like the biggest revelation

2313
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Happy Feet is our future

2314
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Hey listen there's one more area I

2315
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
wanted to talk about. Munchy did you wanna

2316
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
chime in? Yeah I have a thing to

2317
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
say about self-censorship that's alright

2318
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah me too actually. No I censor

2319
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
you yourself

2320
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I walk outside and every

2321
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
single day when I'm interacting with

2322
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
literally any of my family

2323
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
all it is is like

2324
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
self-censorship. That's all it is

2325
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I do not

2326
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
There's this line in a Sam Hyde

2327
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
like one-off

2328
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
like vlog that is just meant

2329
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
to be funny. It has hit home for me

2330
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and made me cry on certain occasions

2331
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Where is it? We are gonna create

2332
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
a community for people just like us

2333
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
brothers it's gonna be called Georgioland

2334
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and I am a white nationalist. Is that

2335
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
the line you're talking about? Yeah that is it

2336
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's sister line

2337
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
is my mom would hate me if she knew what I was

2338
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
really like. Yeah interesting

2339
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
interesting. You know

2340
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I just wanna say

2341
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
about all

2342
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
self-censorship

2343
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
there it is it's happening right now

2344
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I'm trying

2345
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
to get the words out but I won't let me

2346
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I

2347
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
like the idea

2348
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that you can say stuff

2349
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
like the n-word instead of nigg

2350
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
because

2351
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
just because you are okay with it

2352
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and just because

2353
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
people around you probably will be okay with it

2354
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
doesn't mean you have to

2355
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
go as hard as possible every time

2356
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I think it's okay to be

2357
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
like I don't want to be called out as a bitch

2358
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
if I say the n-word

2359
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I think that's just as okay to say niggas

2360
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I think it's fine if people

2361
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
are uncomfortable with saying the word

2362
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because they legitimately don't

2363
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
use it

2364
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
like someone like Anthony Fantano

2365
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
he never says it

2366
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
even if it's in like an album title

2367
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
like but it's because

2368
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
he just he's never been someone

2369
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
who says niggas so like

2370
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
he knows it would be forced if he started now

2371
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
like he's been avoiding it his whole life

2372
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
why would he suddenly start

2373
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
you know that's a reasonable

2374
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
point the reason why I disagree

2375
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and I deliberately dislike when people

2376
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
avoid saying the word is because

2377
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
that really that is the vicious cycle

2378
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
of keeping the word like

2379
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
in this weird state no one can say it

2380
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I do call out I actually

2381
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
just like I've said in the past

2382
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
like I think he's a bitch for not saying it when it's in

2383
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
an album title because I'm like to me

2384
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
that's being ridiculous it's like

2385
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you're you're like you're you're so

2386
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
obsessed with following the rules that

2387
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
the supposed rules that you can't just like

2388
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
literally call the thing by its goddamn

2389
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
name that they gave it

2390
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
you know like it's not disrespectful

2391
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
to call it by the name that they gave

2392
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
it there was there was a time I was

2393
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
at karaoke in Seattle one day and

2394
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I I was I was doing some

2395
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
singing and I was singing

2396
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
some some fucking Kanye

2397
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
song I can't remember what I was it was like the

2398
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
closer for the night I go up there I'm busting

2399
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
it out like the DJ guys this big old

2400
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
black friendly fellow I'm saying it out

2401
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
we get to this part where I bust out

2402
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
some of the stuff the nigga we

2403
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
we lock eyes he gives me a smile and a

2404
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
firm nod and I keep going

2405
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I had that exact experience

2406
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
during karaoke when I was

2407
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
doing yeah because

2408
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I was I was at a karaoke bar with my

2409
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
one of my black friends was there and him

2410
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
and the other black guy who just happened to be

2411
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
at the bar like teamed up to do a Kendrick

2412
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Lamar song because you know

2413
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
hi everyone every if you

2414
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
know anything black then you must

2415
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
be a fan of Kendrick Lamar it's just like the

2416
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
rules right now basically in culture

2417
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
so yeah these guys won't get on

2418
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
stage to do bitch don't kill my vibe

2419
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but I immediately detect that neither

2420
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
of these guys actually knows the words

2421
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
but I do so I get up there

2422
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and I'm like gonna do the actual rap

2423
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
parts you know for these guys

2424
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and I'm sitting there and like I'm saying

2425
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
nigga and I see the dude I can tell the

2426
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
dude who doesn't know me for like one seconds

2427
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
like hold up did that white dude just say

2428
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
nigga but then he's like then again he knows

2429
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
all the words and neither of us do

2430
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
so who's the realest nigga up here for real though

2431
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
right and you know what

2432
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
okay look I'm just gonna like make an assumption here

2433
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
maybe other people like can confirm

2434
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
this if I'm a black guy

2435
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and I hear some white person say nigger

2436
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I might perk up because maybe they're racist

2437
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
or maybe they're chill right and you have to

2438
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
like worry about that right you know

2439
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like it's just unfortunate that we're

2440
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
in a situation where the words are this

2441
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
you know

2442
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
intense oh yeah oh what if

2443
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
what if we send the naked one

2444
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that's good that would be awesome

2445
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
oh by the way the song was runaway I was

2446
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
singing that's what it was

2447
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
one time one time did you remember

2448
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Matthew Matosis review of fireshock

2449
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
infinite where like it's supposed to be

2450
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
this society where people are racist against blacks

2451
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
but they never go farther than saying

2452
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
niggro yeah he literally

2453
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
was like shit maybe saying nigger all

2454
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
the time like because that

2455
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
because if you if you don't let them use

2456
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
the word nigger then you're like

2457
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
you're making your whitewashing it you're making

2458
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
it look better shit than it was

2459
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and like yeah and honestly

2460
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
if you're a person who gets upset when white

2461
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
people say nigger but not black people as

2462
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
much all I can imagine

2463
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
is like an old-timey 1950s photograph

2464
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
with a couple of fucking water faucets

2465
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
there's a nice one that says

2466
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
the words for white people

2467
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
only you can only use prim and proper words

2468
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
if you're a white person then down here at the

2469
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
little dingy water fountain

2470
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
that's the ones that the colored people can say

2471
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
they can say words like nigger if they wish right

2472
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
that's what I see it's fucking

2473
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I hear you all right hey by the way

2474
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
you guys ready for a big call out

2475
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
you want me to you want me to call somebody

2476
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
out on the show oh jeez

2477
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
yes I'm ready I'm ready

2478
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
so this is also this debate

2479
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
is a thing in the black community

2480
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
because of the fact that

2481
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Quentin Tarantino

2482
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
wrote Django Unchained

2483
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Spike Lee is not okay with this

2484
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Spike Lee who's like the blackest

2485
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
director ever you know

2486
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
he made he's made all kinds of

2487
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
fucking great movies he made

2488
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
what's the fucking one that Jesse

2489
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
loves Nate you know it right

2490
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
glorious bastards

2491
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
do the right thing

2492
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
do the right thing

2493
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and like he directed kings of comedy all this other shit

2494
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
he has a real

2495
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
problem with Quentin Tarantino

2496
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
saying you know like writing nigger into his

2497
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
scripts and he called out

2498
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Samuel L. Jackson for being

2499
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
in the movie he was like

2500
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
he's like yo I'm not okay with that

2501
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Samuel L. Jackson was like look

2502
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like this is real shit and he said

2503
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
he said Samuel L. Jackson said you think

2504
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I'm gonna pass up the opportunity to play

2505
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
the most hated black character in

2506
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
cinema history like no I'm taking

2507
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it you know but like

2508
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
it's just what are you trying to do

2509
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Spike Lee are you trying to make it seem

2510
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
like the racist slave holding

2511
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
American south wasn't

2512
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
offensive enough to say nigger

2513
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I mean you know what Spike Lee is trying to do

2514
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
at the end of the day here's what I think it comes down to

2515
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
like I understand

2516
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
why there are some people who are

2517
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
uncomfortable with the message of

2518
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Tarantino's film and why like

2519
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
they would think it's not okay for him to

2520
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
write this movie but

2521
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
like I don't

2522
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
like I don't see how those people cannot

2523
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
understand that there are other black people

2524
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
who will be like no this is actually exactly

2525
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
what I wanted this is totally vindicating

2526
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
and I love it which is how a lot of my

2527
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
black friends were about the movie like

2528
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
literally my friend Marcus

2529
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
was a black guy who didn't really say

2530
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
nigger much until he watched

2531
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Django and then started saying nigger

2532
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
all the time like and he literally

2533
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
attributed it to the movie like

2534
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
that was amazing that's the kind of

2535
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
shit that is actually happening in the

2536
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
world this is real that

2537
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
was a real story I just told you and

2538
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
like you have to think about that when

2539
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
you talk about this shit you got to think

2540
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
about the black guy who watched that movie

2541
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and felt so like

2542
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I mean I don't know what that means about him

2543
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and maybe some people be like oh I'm not okay with

2544
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
that being like how the youth are feeling but

2545
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
like look that's just what it is like this dude came from

2546
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Virginia Beach he was raised

2547
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
weird because he had to go to speech therapy when he was

2548
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
young so he talks white and like

2549
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
people picked up on that and didn't really

2550
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
include him and so he hung out with

2551
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
me and anime nerds and learned how to do

2552
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
kung fu and became jacked and joined

2553
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
the army like this is the kind of people who

2554
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
exist we got to think about everyone

2555
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
who exists when we talk about who can say what

2556
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
words and what they mean to who you know

2557
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
right you know when I like I feel that in

2558
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
myself I forgot my call out though

2559
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
my call out is Nino

2560
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
my call out is Nino who jumped on my

2561
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
song white nigger to help make this

2562
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
point but then he came back

2563
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
later and he got famous on black

2564
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
twitter and started

2565
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
writing for a fucking huffington post

2566
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and I was doing this

2567
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
yeah Nino writes for HuffPo

2568
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
on like their black site like they're

2569
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
they're like black interest

2570
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
page yeah okay

2571
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
point being that because

2572
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
he started like hanging out with them

2573
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
he's all like oh now I now I'm not

2574
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
like about white people saying nigga no

2575
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
more like and I was

2576
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
like oh you fucking cunt

2577
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
you nigger get out of here

2578
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
there you go whatever you know when you

2579
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
talk about like what's up with the double

2580
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
standard and people like people were very

2581
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
explicit about it like movie bob will say

2582
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
dude slavery is why

2583
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
the countries that we are living in right now

2584
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
did these things that underprivileged

2585
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
certain colors and overprivileged others

2586
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
that's the reason there's a double standard

2587
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
because when you go into it on an individual

2588
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
basis it seems like the double standard comes from someone who

2589
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
went to fucking college or got a job in media

2590
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
like or got a fucking liberal

2591
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
friends you know honestly

2592
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I don't have much to say on this point

2593
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
except that I just want

2594
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
to say that like like did you

2595
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
like well I don't know I don't

2596
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
have burn with a seething rage

2597
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
at how how like lucky

2598
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
black people are they get to say the

2599
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
word nigga I don't burn

2600
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
with that but I don't feel that way

2601
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
either I just want to clarify

2602
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
that the reason that I feel so strongly about

2603
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
this is simply that this word

2604
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
has always been in my head

2605
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
and to me it's like

2606
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
it's so ludicrous to be like

2607
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
oh like

2608
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
everything you like has always had

2609
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
this in it like you've you've

2610
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
the movies you grew up on the music you listen to

2611
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
just like everyone else it's the same reason

2612
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
black people use the word is they

2613
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
hear it all the time so that's I

2614
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
heard it all the time and but it's like

2615
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
it's literally discrimination

2616
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
to look at someone and be like oh well you might

2617
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
have grown up with this word just like anybody else

2618
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
but because your skin color is different you can't say it

2619
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I completely agree and that was my point

2620
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
my one of my favorite shows of all

2621
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
time is the boondocks and I know

2622
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
100% without a doubt

2623
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it is due to my love for the boondocks

2624
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
and the excessive use of the word

2625
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
nigga but I started to incorporate it into

2626
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
my day literally when I was 12 I

2627
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
read all of the comics

2628
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
this is what I would call

2629
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
the good kind of cultural appropriation

2630
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
like I developed an appreciation for

2631
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
hip-hop as a result of watching the

2632
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
boondocks and like I got introduced to

2633
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
just like more black characters expanded

2634
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
my interest so I would say

2635
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
that like because of the fact all cultural

2636
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
appropriation is good except for like really

2637
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
tacky cultural appropriation I think

2638
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
that because of the fact that like black

2639
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
culture has so much like meta text

2640
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
to it and that like that the boondocks

2641
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
is specifically about exploring that

2642
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
like when you watch that as someone

2643
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
like me who's got like a very

2644
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
categorical brain where like I

2645
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
memorize all the names and connections between

2646
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
things like I do with the anime industry but like

2647
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
with black culture because it's

2648
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
so self-referential and everybody's like playing

2649
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
off of each other all the time like

2650
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
when you start studying that

2651
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
it's involving in the same way that like anime

2652
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
is and that's why

2653
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I end up like like all my

2654
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
favorite shows that aren't anime are like

2655
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
the boondocks in Atlanta and like other shit

2656
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
like that because like it's almost a narrative

2657
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm keeping up with of like what's going on

2658
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
with the blacks you know like well okay

2659
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I just want to make the point that like

2660
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
it just simply is part

2661
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
of my human experience to like

2662
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
use the word nigga for example

2663
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and I just want people to know that if you

2664
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
tell me that I can't do that that's

2665
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I understand your perspective but

2666
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
it's not that I'm just burning

2667
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
it's just you're simply telling me to not be

2668
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
who I am so if you're comfortable doing that

2669
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that's fine like you can make that

2670
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
argument but that's why I

2671
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
strongly disagree with that point

2672
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
the only other thing I want to talk about was I wanted

2673
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
just to cover for the sake of clarity

2674
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
you always got to touch on the private

2675
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
versus public like censorship

2676
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
legality like

2677
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
what did you get banned on Twitter is this

2678
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
censorship is this you know

2679
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
fucking is that a violin free speech

2680
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
like what's the deal here

2681
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I think that like obviously

2682
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Twitter's

2683
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
they're a company who can do it

2684
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
whatever they want but like

2685
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I do wish that there was like a protected

2686
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
version of Twitter because I think

2687
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Twitter weirdly is

2688
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
like a resource the world needs

2689
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
like I think it's proven that

2690
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
like the amount of like

2691
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
like I mean the entire fucking Arab spring

2692
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
happened because of Twitter like what the fuck

2693
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
like it's it's so important

2694
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
to like disaster

2695
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
relief efforts and stuff like there should

2696
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
be like an open public

2697
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
highway version of Twitter that

2698
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
like yeah and

2699
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
it should be and it should be for everybody like

2700
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
you shouldn't be able to get banned from it you know

2701
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
well that's the thing about corporations in general

2702
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
is that this is something that libertarians

2703
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
because there should be no money let's sorry

2704
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
just there should be no

2705
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
corporate interest tied into it so that people

2706
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
can have unpopular opinions and it's not

2707
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
going to affect anyone's business

2708
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
interest is why I want it to be like yeah

2709
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
you know but like okay so like that's the thing

2710
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
about like corporations in general and this is something

2711
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
that libertarians are they really need

2712
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
to like get themselves fucking

2713
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
woke on this they really need to address this that

2714
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
the whole reason we came up with free

2715
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
government the whole reason we came up with the idea

2716
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
of rights is because we

2717
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
entered an age where we were approaching

2718
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
industry where governments were able

2719
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
to have a level of organized power

2720
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that they could really micromanage and fuck

2721
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
with people's lives no one would have come up

2722
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
with the constitution in like 5000 BC

2723
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
right so for the same

2724
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
reason we are now entering a society

2725
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
where things are so interconnected that

2726
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
corporations are able to do a very similar

2727
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
thing like even though it's all

2728
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
technically voluntary the level

2729
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
of control they can have

2730
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
over society is getting

2731
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
pretty fucking

2732
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
thick and it's getting harder and harder

2733
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
for me to justify it as simply

2734
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
their private company if you know what I mean

2735
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
yeah that's like the argument

2736
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
where people are arguing like our twitter and facebook

2737
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
are they at the point where they're becoming like public

2738
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
utilities that's the issue

2739
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
that's the issue

2740
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
like what if someone still made the argument that

2741
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
well you know the internet's run by private

2742
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
companies so like it took

2743
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
there was a point where we decided

2744
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
that like telephones were a public utility

2745
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
because like an inventor

2746
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
made it and then it became popular

2747
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and then they made a utility and then I think

2748
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
the same happened with the internet and

2749
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
like it's just I really

2750
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
think a lot about this like what's the right

2751
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
balance we I have no interest

2752
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
in like dictating exactly to a company

2753
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
what to do to pursue

2754
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
their profit motive that's that's their business

2755
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
and that's totally fine but on

2756
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
the other side when you're in the business

2757
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
of like allowing people

2758
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
to communicate it becomes

2759
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
like if twitter

2760
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
is actually causing society

2761
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
to splinter down

2762
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
the middle into like a more divided

2763
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
society that is

2764
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
not good and the question is

2765
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
how to address that like social media

2766
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
really seems to just have done

2767
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
this straight up so

2768
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
what's the fix I don't you mean like

2769
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
politically I mean politically yes and

2770
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
along like ideological lines

2771
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
say like oh man fucking

2772
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
social media is going to make it to where you only get

2773
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
articles and headlines that you agree with

2774
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and I I get fucking ha ha

2775
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
here's what Trump did this week like all over

2776
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
the damn place to this day so I don't know

2777
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
like if this isn't working on me but personally

2778
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
in my experience I've

2779
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
seen it as it's making people

2780
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
more aware of what

2781
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
other sides are saying than ever before

2782
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
maybe that's the problem I don't know

2783
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I have the exact same experience

2784
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
as you where I constantly have

2785
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
friends we're both super libsuck

2786
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
you know full of conservative gods

2787
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
ha ha ha ha ha

2788
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
all the issues Trump is bad or Trump is

2789
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
good I think the problem

2790
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
is is that most people do

2791
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
not have

2792
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
people who are they don't have

2793
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
a varied taste in friends yeah they

2794
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
get into the bubble of people who agree with them

2795
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
yeah maybe they get into their bubble because it's

2796
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
really stressful but I think ultimately

2797
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I think the internet still

2798
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
like even in your bubble you're going to see things

2799
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
eat through the algorithms are not perfect

2800
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and I just think that like people are more aware

2801
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
than ever if you go to an extreme opposite

2802
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
end 500 years ago

2803
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
people with opposite political opinions

2804
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
lived in a different country past a border

2805
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and maybe a sea or two and didn't even

2806
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
know them you the only chance you would have

2807
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
to conflict with them is up the

2808
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
broad side of a sword in a battle right

2809
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
but now we actually are much more aware

2810
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
of other world view you know that

2811
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
like yeah that we wouldn't have known about

2812
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and it stresses us out but

2813
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
it moves society you know like like

2814
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
forces us all to hear one another

2815
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I feel like

2816
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
right now I love being alive now

2817
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
because I get to listen to like

2818
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'll listen to fucking like

2819
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Ben Shapiro then like the young Turks

2820
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and then I'll like listen to something Stefan Mullen

2821
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
you says then I'll go listen to like fucking

2822
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Sam Harris, Kyle Kalinsky

2823
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
fucking I'll listen to like the same

2824
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
video about the same topic

2825
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
from like five, six sources

2826
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I can't do that shit

2827
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I would drive me nuts

2828
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
put it on in the background like while I'm working

2829
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
so I just it fills the time and by doing that

2830
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I feel like I'm finally getting closer

2831
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
to like I know everyone's biases

2832
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
because I've listened to all these people a long time

2833
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and now I know like okay Stefan Mullen

2834
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
you is like insanely dedicated

2835
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
to like protecting children to like kind of a

2836
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
crazy degree I'm not calling him crazy but like

2837
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
so like he's got huge biases he hates

2838
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
big government he you know logically

2839
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
see has deducted that like government

2840
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
is evil gotta get rid of it like okay that's his bias

2841
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
the young Turks super left wing

2842
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
but SJW you keep all that bias

2843
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
brings to the table all of internet

2844
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
yeah interaction

2845
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and all trying to deduce the truth

2846
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
from politics yeah it's just

2847
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
like an eight like a times eight

2848
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
or more Venn diagram

2849
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
you have to have everyone's bubble

2850
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
all lined up and then that's right

2851
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
everyone has in common is the truth

2852
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I think that I think Stefan

2853
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Mullen real quick like like the Stefan

2854
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Mullen you think yeah have you

2855
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
heard I think he's probably probably heard him talk about

2856
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
his audio book

2857
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
universally preferable behavior I've never listened to it

2858
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
but I've heard about it I recommend it to you because

2859
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
it's basically him trying to derive

2860
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
in a sense of objective morality

2861
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
yeah it's through like just logic it's just

2862
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
what I've been to yeah yeah I feel like

2863
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
utilitarians would it would be your

2864
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I'd like never quite get through it because he

2865
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I feel like I'm finally ready to try and listen to all of it

2866
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
because he's basically it's him trying to solve the problem

2867
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
with no one being able to agree on morality

2868
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
right so I don't know

2869
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I gotta listen to it

2870
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
God you fucking I didn't expect

2871
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
you to go out about that audio book it made me forget

2872
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
what the fuck point I was gonna try to make

2873
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
well shit about biases

2874
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
something to do with oh that I

2875
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
don't think the problem is that

2876
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
we we get into like a bubble and only listen

2877
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
to a few voices it's that those voices

2878
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
are not good or are untrustworthy

2879
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
okay that like there's too many voices

2880
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
that like

2881
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
there's a reason that I've come to where like

2882
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
the only like politicized

2883
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
YouTuber who I really follow is

2884
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
RazorFist and it's not because

2885
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I agree with everything

2886
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
he says it's because I trust

2887
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
him to do

2888
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
the most research

2889
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
that every video he does he will

2890
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
have looked at everything he knows

2891
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
the names of everyone

2892
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
in the government he knows

2893
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
like what they're doing he knows their histories

2894
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
he knows what's

2895
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
happening he doesn't listen to the media

2896
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and what they're saying he waits until

2897
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
there is real information that he can use

2898
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
and he almost always

2899
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
comes out like if he said something was

2900
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
going to happen it usually happens

2901
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
because he's keeping track of what's

2902
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
going on better than anybody and like

2903
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
the world is not that hard to understand

2904
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
you just need to know all the information

2905
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
the problem with like the young Turks

2906
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
and Kyle Kulinski to a degree a lot of

2907
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
these guys who do daily

2908
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
multiple episodes of the show

2909
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
they want to produce content as fast

2910
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
as possible and I don't think any of them have bad intention

2911
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
but it's their business model that puts

2912
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
him in a position of doing that

2913
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
fundamentally the reason why he has the luxury

2914
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
to be fucking informed is that he's

2915
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
not a political

2916
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
YouTuber he talks about video games

2917
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and heavy metal and he only makes

2918
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
a statement on politics

2919
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
when he has a statement that he's actually pretty confident

2920
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
in and can look cool making

2921
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and I mean

2922
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
someone else who like their

2923
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
their job every morning is to get up and like

2924
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
put on their spin to make them

2925
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
make their side look good it's just

2926
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I'll tell you right now that while I'm happy

2927
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
this hasn't happened

2928
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
if like super bunny hop ever

2929
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
became a political guy

2930
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
he would be one of the only people I'd listen to

2931
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
because I know he'll do all the research

2932
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I know he'll come in with all the

2933
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
info he'll never open his mouth about it

2934
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
if he if he didn't you know I have a

2935
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
yeah and like that's why I have so much

2936
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
respect for both of those guys

2937
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
as as like journalists

2938
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
on YouTube because I think

2939
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
that we're in an era now where

2940
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
magazines are just straight up

2941
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
irrelevant and because

2942
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
of the fact that none of them know how to adapt

2943
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
to YouTube because they're all fucking retarded

2944
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
we have we as YouTubers

2945
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
have to figure out how to make journalism

2946
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
possible on the platform and like

2947
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
those two guys are the only people

2948
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
who I know of who I consider like

2949
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
serious respectable journalists

2950
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
who I can trust to have done

2951
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
all the research and I know

2952
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
they're going to tell me facts you know

2953
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
dude dude doctor wolf watches

2954
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
the episode before he

2955
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
he goes deep

2956
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
he goes deep

2957
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
like integrity

2958
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
doctor wolf always gets a laugh

2959
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I want to know what my self-censorship real quick

2960
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
before we close out okay because when did you

2961
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
talk about him and his his childhood

2962
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I really wanted to just share my piece

2963
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
we went on a different course so I'll just let things

2964
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
ease down now so you know

2965
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
having like Christian non-swery parents

2966
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
parents who I want to go put

2967
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
it on the record will say

2968
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
like nigger if we're talking about the word

2969
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
like they'll say it out of context

2970
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
they'll say racial words out of context

2971
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
but they'll never say fuck or shit out of context

2972
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
right I'm just like

2973
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
nah that's a little bit bullshit

2974
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
that's a little bit bullshit anyway you know and then also

2975
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
like being homeschooled

2976
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and put into sort of like a really tight Christian

2977
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
bubble of like various like kids

2978
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
who also have Christian parents so there was

2979
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
just unlike Digi not really

2980
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
ever surrounded by

2981
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
swear words right and not having

2982
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
watched adult content as a child

2983
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
so like it took me a while to even learn

2984
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
what all the swear words were actually

2985
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
and like you know it's like you know seven

2986
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
or eight or so and

2987
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
then by the time I'm around 13

2988
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I start getting into more like I start

2989
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
watching like South Park or Family Guy

2990
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and stuff like that just completely off my own volition

2991
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
because my parents like don't even barely even watch

2992
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
much TV at this point

2993
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
let's just watch Fox News actually

2994
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
all the fucking cop drama shows

2995
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
but so then like you know I'll be watching

2996
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
like South Park right and then my dad

2997
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
will be like oh would you watch it I'm watching

2998
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
South Park you know and he's like

2999
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
hmm and I know exactly

3000
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
what to tell him to like

3001
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
to shut him off right right which is

3002
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
oh don't worry I'm not going to go around

3003
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
swearing like they do in South Park

3004
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and he's like okay I guess that's fine you know

3005
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and then like maybe I'll be showing some episodes to Aaron

3006
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
who my brother who at this point would be like 12

3007
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
years old and like

3008
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I'd be like hmm I don't know

3009
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
but hey Aaron's like don't worry neither

3010
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
of us are going to swear don't worry we're not going to do it

3011
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
you know and he's like okay as long as you promise

3012
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
to not be like those violent cartoons

3013
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
and then you can totally do it

3014
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
so what happened was

3015
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
as we get older by the time we're like

3016
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
adults or like he's almost an adult

3017
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
we no longer

3018
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
like give a single shit like we

3019
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
are perfectly fine to swear on one another

3020
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
because we do not care anymore

3021
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
except for the fact that we've

3022
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
promised to not swear as a result

3023
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
of watching swearing cartoons

3024
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
and we're both filled with pride over it

3025
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
we have so much ego on the line

3026
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
to prove to our father

3027
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
that we're not going to break the promise not of like

3028
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
loyalty but just to prove that we're

3029
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
this is exactly the line this is the exact

3030
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
logic that me and Victor are on

3031
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and exactly like didgy

3032
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
we came up with our own like swear genre

3033
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
so for example we started using

3034
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
um van

3035
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
as a swear word right like what the van

3036
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
is going on here yeah are you van

3037
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
and kidding me right so

3038
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
we came up with that as a swear

3039
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
because we were think we were talking about

3040
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
like old actors maybe we were even talking

3041
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
about Mary Poppins we were we brought

3042
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
up dick van dyke and we thought

3043
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
you know dick if van

3044
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
were a bad word dick van dyke's

3045
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
entire name would be bad yeah I

3046
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
thought you were going to go with uh Jean Claude

3047
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
van dam to avoid saying the word

3048
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
damn that works too but that would apply

3049
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
as well but just you know but dick van dyke

3050
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
so there you go so van

3051
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
just started saying van as a swear we

3052
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I think we gave it like a couple years of run time

3053
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
before it like really wore out as welcome and just

3054
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
made us cringe and then that's just when we started

3055
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I'm curious to know on the subject

3056
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
you have like made up swear words like that

3057
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
did your parents ever object to like not

3058
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
the word but like sort of the tone

3059
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
that you say the word with like hey I know

3060
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
what you're doing there buddy you're trying to get

3061
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
something past me by saying a completely

3062
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
literally inoffensive word but it's your tone

3063
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
that's the swear being said oh yeah

3064
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
yes oh what the fuck

3065
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
and overreacting it's all about tone and shit

3066
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
he wouldn't like it's anything he wouldn't like

3067
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
punish me well sure sure no matter how young I was

3068
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
but it was just sort of like it's just interesting

3069
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
once again my mind is being torn apart

3070
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
by the breadth of the realization

3071
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
that this is just what the 90s was

3072
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
like this isn't unique to our households

3073
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
because this is the entire logic

3074
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
that humankind

3075
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
underwent up until

3076
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
the 2000s and here's what I mean

3077
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
do you any of you remember

3078
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't know if you were still watching Cartoon Network

3079
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
at all at the time when regular show came out

3080
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I know Munchie

3081
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I don't really like to call myself a 90s kid

3082
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
this was all 2000s

3083
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
do you guys remember the first time on regular

3084
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
show that they said piss

3085
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
no I don't did anybody see

3086
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
that was that like ground

3087
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
to me it was because

3088
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
okay okay on adventure

3089
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
time first of all kids are

3090
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
they saying suck on cartoons

3091
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
they said suck on

3092
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Steven Universe the other day

3093
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
exactly so they

3094
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
started saying okay adventure time broke the

3095
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
seal on saying sucks

3096
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
and like dang it and heck

3097
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
and stuff like that like they were able to say that

3098
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
shit then regular show

3099
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
yeah they could say kill and die

3100
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
and they've used that a lot

3101
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
they like really went in on the fact

3102
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
there's like a whole regular show about dying

3103
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
and then there's yeah

3104
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
in regular show they started saying piss off

3105
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
they started saying

3106
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
is the idea behind the word suck

3107
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
like suck dick is that like

3108
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
we're suck puns because then

3109
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
you have feminists on it

3110
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I guess we're gonna have to have a whole

3111
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
fucking debate on that

3112
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
because you couldn't say

3113
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
you couldn't say suck

3114
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
but you could say that something blows

3115
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
even though they're literally saying

3116
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
that is true

3117
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
the fucking thing about it is

3118
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I literally watched them

3119
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
physically move

3120
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
the overton window

3121
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
like a boulder like sycophus pushing it up

3122
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
the hill like because you can

3123
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
look at the 80s and see that

3124
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
there was a period where cartoons were

3125
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
a lot more violent and crazy because like

3126
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
G.I. Joe was the biggest thing and transformers

3127
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
and all that shit and

3128
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
then you go to the 90s and they cleaned

3129
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
it all up no one there's like

3130
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
no guns anymore no one can say kill

3131
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
no one can like you know

3132
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
do this or that and then you get to the

3133
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I definitely remember Bart Simpson saying that

3134
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
well Simpsons was different

3135
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and that was why Simpsons was so popular

3136
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
was that it was like a counterbalance

3137
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
because it aired on primetime TV

3138
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
on WB it was not a kids show

3139
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
that's the thing this is not

3140
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
like it always gets less censorship it's an ebb

3141
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and flow you see an old cartoon the characters

3142
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
can fucking drink alcohol and be drunk

3143
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
and now speaking of the Simpsons

3144
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
we might be entering an era where it's

3145
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
too problematic to have a white person

3146
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
voicing non-white character

3147
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
the thing about like both America

3148
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
and Japan are very particular

3149
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
about time slots as being like

3150
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
the definition of what can and cannot pass

3151
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
so like primetime TV

3152
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
like even with adventure time

3153
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
and regular show the reason those shows could get away with that

3154
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
is that they usually aired in the afternoon

3155
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
and it was more of like an older

3156
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
like the kids who were like

3157
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
10 to 15 watched during

3158
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
that time you know as opposed to the

3159
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
really little kids who they're gonna like

3160
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
just show nothing but Teen Titans go to

3161
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
you all morning because that's like

3162
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Teen Titans go is

3163
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
the only show they've ever made that is

3164
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
not only great but also

3165
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
like it's so mind numbingly

3166
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
colorful that kids can just stare at it all day

3167
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
so that's all they air through the morning

3168
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
but like you know

3169
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
as they moved to like younger and

3170
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
younger shows using these words even

3171
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Teen Titans go is gonna say these words now

3172
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
you know like even the stuff they're

3173
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
showing to little kids because like just nobody

3174
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
cares anymore like now that we have the

3175
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
internet you cannot protect kids

3176
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
from bad words anymore like it's just fucking

3177
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
impossible unless you really are strict

3178
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
parent you know but like

3179
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
it's like we can't lie to

3180
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
ourselves any longer and why did we

3181
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
ever do it in the first place we all look like idiots

3182
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I think religious regions

3183
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I think a lot of this came from

3184
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
like oh oh oh yeah yeah I have to

3185
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
tell you guys the one last fucking fake

3186
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
square I came up with okay well me me and my

3187
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
brother did wasn't really what was more like

3188
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
it was actually an all new innovation

3189
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
in the whole medium of language itself

3190
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
so my brother

3191
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
he just started saying shitsu you know

3192
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
oh shitsu oh man

3193
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
or even my fiance she likes to say shetlinpony

3194
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
right but yeah shitsu

3195
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
oh shitsu you know and then

3196
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
we were like oh shitsu and then sometimes

3197
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
we delayed it oh shit

3198
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
now you're pushing the edge there boy you're getting

3199
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
ready for a beat oh oh you have no idea

3200
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
oh yeah oh that's just the beginning

3201
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
then we were like wait a second we were just like

3202
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
oh shitsu oh shitsu wait a second

3203

3204
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
shitsu it still works

3205
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
we're like we have this

3206
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
like agreement

3207
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
it's all arbitrary right yeah like

3208
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
language it's all arbitrary the fact that

3209
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
fuck is offensive in the first place is arbitrary

3210
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
it was just made up no one's gonna be around

3211
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
to challenge this we hereby declare

3212
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
that you could swear as many fucking

3213
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
goddamn mother shitting cunt

3214
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
blocking times as you want as long as you

01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
stay sue within any

3216
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
time afterwards that's good I like it

3217
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000

01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
just like we promised our dad I like that

3224
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
that's creativity at work

3225
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
so have we figured anything out here

3226
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
have we answered the question of

3227
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
is free speech cool or is it gay

3228
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
no what we've learned is that we can

3229
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
just say nigger sue and it's fine

3230
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
yeah it's all arbitrary

3231
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
it's a bunch of bullshit let hashtag

3232
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
let children swear

3233
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
that's where I'm at that's where I'm at with this

3234
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
what we've learned is that we've already

3235
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
heard all of these complaints

3236
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
yeah yeah you're right on all of our other

3237
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
shows and this has bred

3238
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
no new conversation whatsoever

3239
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
agreed indeed

3240
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I hope you listen to this podcast

3241
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
while doing something productive

3242
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
fans you know friends and family out there

3243
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
that's what I do when I listen to podcasts

3244
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
let me talk about my 4chan uncle

3245
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
because I'm in an interesting situation

3246
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
4chan uncle

3247
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
as you all know I have an uncle

3248
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
he goes on 4chan

3249
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
a deadly combination

3250
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
and he's always downstairs

3251
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
in my house now because he's a dead bean

3252
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
for various other reasons

3253
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
and so I'm walking downstairs

3254
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
and he always tries to rote me in conversations

3255
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
about Hitler and the Jews

3256
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
no matter how he's doing harassment

3257
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
you wouldn't censor his free speech

3258
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
by not listening to him now would you munchie

3259
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
no I would never censor his free speech

3260
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I just have my own free speech

3261
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
the entire reason that he is talking to me

3262
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
in the first place

3263
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
he's always been in a stupor

3264
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and he doesn't really talk to anyone

3265
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
but I have

3266
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
outed myself as someone who

3267
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
knows what 4chan is

3268
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
oh no

3269
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
he always wants to talk to me

3270
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
you can't underling this bell

3271
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
exactly I can't explain to him

3272
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
but I don't believe these same things

3273
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
or you know do any of this stuff

3274
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I just know what 4chan is

3275
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
but I'm not going to do that

3276
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm just going to censor myself

3277
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
and just go along with whatever political opinion is

3278
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
so mostly because I'm just a coward

3279
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
that's the only reason that this is happening

3280
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
sounds like a hassle

3281
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
you want to save space at home

3282
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
we all want to save space at home

3283
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I don't even challenge scary 4chan ideas

3284
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I'm in this bizarre

3285
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
dichotomy

3286
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
whenever I'm around my mom's

3287
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
it's like yeah I fucking hate Trump

3288
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
and then whenever I'm with my uncle

3289
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I'm like yeah I fucking want to suck Trump's dick

3290
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
looking pretty dangly right there

3291
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
but also

3292
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
hey can you take me out to lunch real quick

3293
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I'm playing like a fiddle

3294
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I was going to say having

3295
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
pretty

3296
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
hardline but firmline

3297
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
strict conservative Christian

3298
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
type people as parents

3299
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
and then also being an art person

3300
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
on the internet

3301
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
pretty good at spinning whatever I want to say

3302
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
to be palatable to both people

3303
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
like oh oh oh oh

3304
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
me and my fiance were

3305
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
at dinner with both my parents

3306
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
and we were actually talking about

3307
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Stefan Molinou's peaceful parenting

3308
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
paradigm system that he's created

3309
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
which is all about don't spank kids

3310
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
don't even yell at kids

3311
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
don't even punish them, use reason, logic

3312
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
and whatever the fuck which I'm really interested in

3313
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
but I know

3314
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
that if I say to my parents

3315
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
the idea is to never spank kids

3316
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
especially my mom is going to immediately

3317
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
perk up and be like

3318
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
no, right?

3319
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
so I'm like trying to avoid saying that

3320
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but then like my fiance does

3321
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
anyway she's like yeah the idea is to never spank kids

3322
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
and my mom goes

3323
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
try getting that to work on every kid you have

3324
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
um

3325
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Davoo was abused

3326
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
that's what we've learned here today

3327
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
thank you for listening

3328
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
should we move to questions

3329
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I want to say one last thing

3330
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
my favorite thing to do

3331
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
in Super Smash Brothers

3332
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
is to throw the

3333
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
ice item at

3334
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Princess Peach

3335
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
hashtag

3336
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
free speech

3337
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
wait

3338
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
free speech

3339
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
free speech

3340
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
there it is

3341
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
classic hippo tweet

3342
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
the first question

3343
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
is from two weeks one spar

3344
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
and I'm curious about this as well

3345
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
is it too late for me to get into

3346
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
rowdy fuckers cop killers lore

3347
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
oh absolutely

3348
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
no it is never too late

3349
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
what do you have to do to get in

3350
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
because I listened to the latest episode

3351
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
not having heard the last few

3352
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
and tried to join the discord

3353
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
and it was totally incomprehensible

3354
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
okay I would say that

3355
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
in terms of what to listen to

3356
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
probably the streams on twitch

3357
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
are the best things

3358
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
on twitch

3359
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
on twitch slash rowdy

3360
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
frickers cop killers

3361
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
we tried to make it rowdy frickers cop killers

3362
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
which literally would not allow us to have it

3363
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
for the record cop killing is allowed on twitch

3364
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
but fucking is strictly banned

3365
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
did you guys see

3366
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
what I told you that I deleted

3367
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
last night

3368
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
in the chat

3369
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
please say that on the podcast

3370
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
fucking embares yourself right now

3371
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
this is amazing

3372
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
so I've been doing

3373
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
just blood borne videos

3374
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
with May and so I just had the game

3375
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
open and the recording software open

3376
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
and she had gone to bed and I was listening to

3377
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
rowdy fuckers cop killers and I wanted to make

3378
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
a video explaining

3379
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
why the PCPs quality

3380
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
had sort of fluctuated so much over time

3381
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
like what literal

3382
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
physical things happened

3383
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
such as that it used to be

3384
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
that everyone was editing it

3385
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
and like because

3386
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
people were putting effort into the editing

3387
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
and then that no longer became

3388
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
incentivized or like

3389
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
the people who were doing it weren't available to do it anymore

3390
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
so now it's different and like

3391
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
just things like that

3392
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
you know I explained all of it

3393
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
it was like 40 minutes long

3394
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and I edited it I listened to the whole thing back

3395
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I fucking created this video

3396
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
started uploading it

3397
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
and it was like 20% done

3398
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
but like because of the fact that I'm doing

3399
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Let's Plays I'm just like trying to get all the footage on

3400
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
and off my computer constantly

3401
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
so I just deleted literally

3402
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
everything while

3403
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
it was still uploading not realizing

3404
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
that it had not finished uploading

3405
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Jesus Christ did you I linked

3406
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
a program that might be able to let you recover the files

3407
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
it's possible it could theoretically be recovered

3408
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
if you do it quickly how I

3409
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
deleted everything like oh there's

3410
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
it's a real thing deleted files

3411
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
this is a program I link over Cuba

3412
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
try it out it's possible

3413
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
but yeah I

3414
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
including the thumbnail and everything

3415
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
like that because I had already uploaded

3416
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000

3418
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
15 minutes making a thumbnail

3419
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
you look straight at the thumbnail for the video you were uploading

3420
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I'm like I don't need this anymore

3421
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000

but to the important question

3427
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
to the important question rowdy fuckers cop

3428
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
killer right you can watch the twitch

3429
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
videos but mostly you got to join

3430
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000

there's no like when you go into

3435
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
the discord it doesn't give you like a pamphlet

there's the basic training room with a link

3439
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
to the help document actually

3440
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
crack is working on

3441
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
crack is working on like a new website

3442
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
that has like a more detailed like explanation

3443
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
can you just make it I will explain it to you

3444
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
right now I will explain to you right now

3445
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
by which I mean he's hacking

3446
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
okay

3447
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
the rifle is cop killers

3448
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
originally it was supposed to be a non-setting

3449
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
and it was not supposed to have lore and I

3450
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
specifically said this to bin that we should probably keep

3451
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
just a grounded setting and unfortunately

3452
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
even though I quite enjoy the lore

3453
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
it's warped in this bizarre

3454
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
like stealing your dad ripoff show

3455
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
basically

3456
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
it's still your dad painted green

3457
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
but it's also canon to stealing your dad

3458
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
no it's not

3459
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
didn't it come into being before the lore of stealing your dad

3460
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
no no

3461
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
no it's not it's not at all

3462
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
it's not you would make you change the lore

3463
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
okay okay okay where's the lore of

3464
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
stealing your dad deep in

3465
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
the arizona desert where

3466
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
the grand canyon exists

3467
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
there's existed a town and that town had

3468
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
nuclear a nuclear reactor on it

3469
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
and that nuclear reactor spilled

3470
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
and it flooded the entire grand canyon

3471
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
with toxic waste a.k.a.

3472
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
slime

3473
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
and this slime was so valuable for

3474
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
various obvious reasons

3475
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
there's a specified obvious reasons

3476
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
yeah yeah

3477
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
but there was a city erected next to it

3478
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
named we don't we're not entirely sure

3479
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
some of the names are

3480
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
slime city or neo los angeles city

3481
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
or neo melwami

3482
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
or neo guys i just want to let you know

3483
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
every time i say the name of the city

3484
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
i always say new los angeles city

3485
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
a.k.a. neomilwaki

3486
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
you have to say the whole thing

3487
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
that is what i want to say for me

3488
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
NO DO IT NO

3489
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
okay the rest of the lore is this

3490
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
this decay america's fastest

3491
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
growing city is just a normal city

3492
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
but it's green

3493
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
and inside the city there exists

3494
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
an obelisk with unknown

3495
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
presumably extraterrestrial

3496
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
properties known as endless war

3497
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
who incentivizes violence

3498
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
with his mere presence

3499
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
me and bin in real life

3500
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
have moved to slime city

3501
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
to try and get rich

3502
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
working the slime mines mine the valuable slime

3503
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
and we've started a let's play

3504
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
show for a leisure and that it

3505
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
canonically exists within the world

3506
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
and because me and bin presumably after playing

3507
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
a heated match of super smash brothers

3508
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
got really mad at each other but because we're such

3509
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
pussies we didn't want to directly fight

3510
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
one other so we rounded the local youth

3511
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
and endangered

3512
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
juveniles and forced them to do proxy

3513
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
warfare because we're too close to fight each other

3514
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
in real life

3515
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
wait but do you guys like live and work together

3516
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
in canon? yes

3517
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
we live in a house to get our own apartment together

3518
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
and we record let's plays on twitch

3519
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
are the rowdies and the fuckers aware of this

3520
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
that you like live together?

3521
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
in the discord

3522
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
in the streets

3523
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
in the mean streets of slime city

3524
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
is the discord literally a real

3525
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
or is it a metaphor for a war

3526
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
you're just going to have to find out

3527
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
you're just going to have to find out

3528
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
watch the streams

3529
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
to find the place to do the

3530
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
combat to pick a side

3531
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
let me tell you this is a real thing

3532
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
with real life consequence

3533
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
because me and munchy released the new rowdy fuckers video

3534
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
well I released whatever we did it

3535
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I released it the other day and in response to that

3536
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
video coming out new people

3537
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
joined the discord and the discord became more active

3538
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and this affected the slime economy

3539
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
so much that slime stock

3540
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
prices went through the roof

3541
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
and the economy was destroyed

3542
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
as certain people

3543
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
as certain people became insanely wealthy

3544
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
on the slime coin stock market

3545
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
as a result in like a month or so

3546
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
me and bin are going to have to fight

3547
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
iron man style with at least

3548
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
400 mucks in pokemon

3549
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
at least 400 mucks

3550
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
at least

3551
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
hey guys it's me

3552
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
no it's the lord of ghosts

3553
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
no it can't be the lord of ghosts

3554
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
he's so scary

3555
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
it's the lord of ghosts

3556
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
he's a rowdy fuckers calculus character

3557
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
it's the lord of ghosts

3558
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
and he's also real he exists in the real world

3559
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I'm very scary

3560
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000

02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000

don't feed into his lies

3564
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
the lord of ghosts is too scared

3565
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
do not feed the negus slime

3566
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
it's bad and I'm scared of it

3567
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
believe lord of ghosts I have all these incest

3568
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I have the salt whenever I scratch my head

3569
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
there's like a Kyoto blossom of skin

3570
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
and salt and you can pop it in your mouth

3571
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I'm gonna feed that right to the right fucking now

3572
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
oh no I gotta get out of here

3573
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
holy shit

3574
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
what a haunting

3575
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
rowdy the rowdy fucker conquered his fear

3576
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
and drove away the lord of ghosts

3577
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
this time

3578
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
oh did I just miss the lord of ghosts

3579
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
oh yeah but don't worry

3580
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I was just peeing

3581
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I have a feeling we'll see him again real soon

3582
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
tune in to slime fest 2

3583
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
yes

3584
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
since we're on the subject of meta questions

3585
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
and behind the scenes shit

3586
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Gwee Kale asks where's the bonus radcon 3 content

3587
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
for non backers

3588
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
we still haven't resolved it I don't think

3589
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
there's no progress on the subject

3590
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
good question I think we've all just

3591
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
at least I've been wrapped up and there's still

3592
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
some major videos to get done for it

3593
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
but we really should just release that

3594
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
in some fashion the typical thing

3595
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
about all these kick starters is it's like

3596
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
it's hard to say exactly when

3597
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
is this

3598
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
appropriate yeah when is this appropriate

3599
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
to address when we still have like unfinished

3600
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
business in doing the actual thing

3601
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
you know

3602
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
which we were all hard at work on by the way

3603
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
the silly our dads are being aided currently

3604
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and I went into like a Ryers meeting

3605
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
with Ethan and we went through it all

3606
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and we wrote down some jokes and funny shit to edit in

3607
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
and so those will be out soon and they're looking

3608
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
to be quite juicy

3609
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I mean to clarify

3610
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
we have given like

3611
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
all the bonus content has been released for

3612
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
the Kickstarter people

3613
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
it's just like we're deliberating whether or not

3614
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
on when if we are

3615
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
to like sell it to everyone else

3616
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
yeah I mean I definitely want to

3617
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
it's just the only mechanism I really

3618
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
think that we have is to like make it some sort

3619
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
of patron reward

3620
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
but I don't want to like I don't know

3621
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
that's kind of a weird way to handle it other than

3622
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
that like I don't know how to like actually set up

3623
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
like a purchase thing where someone can send us like let's

3624
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
say five bucks

3625
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
and then we give them all the videos in response

3626
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I don't know how to like do that so

3627
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I don't know we got a workshop something we

3628
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
should talk about this tomorrow's meeting or something probably

3629
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Dan it's Jack you probably know something

3630
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
send it to us yeah if you want to tweet at us

3631
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
send us some ideas so we're already

3632
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
two hours and seven minutes do we want more questions

3633
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
or I got one question from the

3634
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
from the from a pity question

3635
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
for today from the Twitter at TP

3636
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
crass tears hashtag ask BCP

3637
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
here's a question at zoom

3638
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
zyke asks what color

3639
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
best embodies you as a person

3640
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and I just want to redirect you

3641
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
to the newest episode of ready fuckers

3642
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
cop killers where Ben and munchy go through

3643
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
a big old breakdown of all the colors

3644
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
associated with the people here are the

3645
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
problem children here are the problems

3646
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
yeah bow and digi are the problem

3647
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
when when it comes to PCP

3648
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
you say you say it's

3649
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
you're the problem but you could just as easily

3650
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
say that mage and Nate

3651
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
are the problem well I mean

3652
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
the reason that okay like munchy

3653
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
and Ben were saying for example that they love

3654
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
my color my bright green which I agree

3655
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
is great and it like fits my stuff

3656
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
it's whatever it's entrenched like give

3657
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it has always had this like

3658
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
green but it is a grandfathered

3659
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
in from the pony days Tom has never had

3660
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
like a set color he was like blue as a pony

3661
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
then he had the red with rebel pixels

3662
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
just has gravitated in sky blue we all kind

3663
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
of know this Ben is black and white munchy

3664
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
is obviously pink and mage

3665
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
insists on being an extremely

3666
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
specific hexadecimal value

3667
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
purple and everything so

3668
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
see that's the thing is that like a mage

3669
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
has like both mage and I

3670
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
have historically like always been

3671
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
like pink purple range

3672
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
like that is true that she

3673
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
back in the pony days to make you like

3674
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
an indigo digi but it doesn't really

3675
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
back in the pony days she was like a darker

3676
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
like a deeper purple and I was

3677
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
more of like the pinkish purple because

3678
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I had like the sweetie bell design and

3679
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
everything on my pony yeah she's my

3680
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I mean but you know people

3681
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
but yeah but like I mean like I've got

3682
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
like the magenta meme thing right now

3683
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
which I kind of want to lean in on because

3684
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I'm gonna make it like a relevant plot point

3685
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
in my I think you should yeah

3686
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
like good meme so yeah I that's

3687
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
what we kind of settled on you on you

3688
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
kind of like in between red and purple

3689
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
okay I'm completely fine did you

3690
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
with you also being purple in fact I

3691
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
want that I think that is a good idea

3692
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
but there just are so few

3693
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
like cool colors it just

3694
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
honestly I feel like what we're

3695
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
the approach that you guys have taken

3696
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
maybe reconsider the idea that like

3697
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
we're trying to represent a whole range of

3698
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
colors and more just that it's like

3699
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
a set of like a palette

3700
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
that complements each other yeah like

3701
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
you know what you're deciding a ghibli movie

3702
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
or something like you're just choosing colors that

3703
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
go good together you know

3704
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
yeah yeah that's pretty much I don't

3705
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
know that they do well it's just

3706
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
it's just kind of a lopsided rainbow

3707
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
really yeah the

3708
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I'm like on the one side

3709
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
you've got that you've got like the reds and the pinks

3710
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
on the other sides and then you've got like the greens

3711
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I'm sort of saying that you can reconsider

3712
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
the color design to be more like

3713
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
that that it's it's less about

3714
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
like having a breadth of

3715
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
colors and more about creating an aesthetic

3716
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
in the way that the colors blend

3717
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
you know you know I really think

3718
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
thinking about we should really make me like

3719
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I think we just have to change mage to be

3720
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
like a deeper like purple blue

3721
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
like she was in the 20 days

3722
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
you're gonna she's gonna fucking riot

3723
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
this is gonna be warfare in the streets

3724
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
well that would help

3725
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
so much wouldn't it because there would be more blue

3726
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
let's okay here's what we need we just would

3727
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
but we can't just we can't we can't

3728
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
fucking miss color here's what we do

3729
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
here's what we do hashtag

3730
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000

3731
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
we need to start

3732
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
she needs to become orange to fill

3733
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
out our color palette that's what we're missing

3734
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
we have yellow we have red

3735
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Ben is like Ben's like the hemospectrum car

3736
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
cat where he's like the orange guy the time

3737
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
for God and it's just become black and white

3738
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
which is fine but we need a goddamn

3739
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
orange and we got like hidden behind

02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000

but I if if we

3753
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
really need to change it I would

3754
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
not mind going into a briska blue

3755
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
oh

3756
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000

3757
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000

3763
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
decades long rise

3764
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000

02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
that's that's always been you know what

3777
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
make it hashtag make Gibb blue

3778
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I like it I would think that if we needed

3779
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
orange Nate has like plenty of orange

3780
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
shit in his like I could not

3781
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
no okay listen listen to me

3782
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I cannot be orange because of the communist

3783
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
glasses meme I cannot be

3784
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
orange it's unacceptable

3785
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I would die and plus like we need

3786
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that light green like nobody's like that kind

3787
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
of green

3788
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I personally believe like

3789
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
like you Nate

3790
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Ben

3791
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
and like

3792
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I don't know maybe me are like the strongest

3793
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
like no one can budge that like no one can budge

3794
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
the next I love my

3795
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
my bright green for the following reasons

3796
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
one it is matched like the background color

3797
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
of all the art since Ben first designed it

3798
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
years ago to it is like

3799
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
the color of spiral power which

3800
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I always think to myself whenever I look

3801
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
at it and there's a third reason I can't remember

3802
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
but those two are good enough

3803
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
some other third yeah we'll ever change that

3804
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I wrote it down but I think like four reasons

3805
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I just like purple because I

3806
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
associate it with dementia and that's

3807
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
like I've always tried

3808
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
to convey that my videos are

3809
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
someone who's unhinged and lost their

3810
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
mind and like that's like I want

3811
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
that to be a constant presence felt in my

3812
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
videos that like this guy might

3813
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
be insane and that's why I've

3814
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
always used purple theming except

3815
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
for what I'm trying to be like accessible

3816
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
like in the pony videos where I had green

3817
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
so I was like that's why the after dark

3818
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
videos were purple and the main channel videos

3819
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
were green it was like oh

3820
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
wait real quick I remembered what the third

3821
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
point was because I looked it up it's that

3822
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
the purple and pink of my avatars look really

3823
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
good with yellow because it looks like delicious

3824
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
watermelon that's that's oh I remember

3825
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
when I was designing Wewaga though I specifically

3826
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
was trying to make it a watermelon that's

3827
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
right you did yep that's absolutely right

3828
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
that's absolutely right yeah like greens

3829
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
purples and pinks are like my my my

3830
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
by the way did you I remember

3831
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
this moment I stuck that with me in my mind for like many

3832
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
a year where I sent you

3833
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
like this in card featuring did you bro

3834
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
did you brony in in a

3835
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
in the background like a little of a bar

3836
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
and you said that that was your favorite

3837
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
thing that you've ever like I've ever

3838
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
made was was fucking did you brony

3839
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
in a bar and it was fun because

3840
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
like I am super into

3841
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
the aesthetic of bars

3842
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
and like it was just a I mean

3843
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
back then I didn't have shit tons of fan

3844
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
art so I hadn't been presented in this way

3845
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
over and over again like

3846
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
now I have like hundreds of drawings of me

3847
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
like smoking weed and drinking and all this

3848
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
like people exclusively draw

3849
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
me like doing those things now

3850
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
but at the time it was like oh my god someone

3851
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
finally drew me in a bar like this is where

3852
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
my pony has always belonged

3853
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
you know and like now we're finally here

3854
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
hey here's a here's a funny

3855
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
ish question anyone else want to comment on

3856
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
this color thing

3857
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
no okay great

3858
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I just want to say how much how glad

3859
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I am that I snatched up the black and

3860
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
white yeah you really lucked out there's not

3861
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
there's nothing else people would fight over that

3862
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
like in like in Pulp Fiction

3863
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
when they all not sorry Reservoir Dogs when

3864
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
they all thought of her who'd be Mr. Black

3865
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
but anyway yeah one spar and

3866
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
with another question here asks during the

3867
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
process of editing a video I find

3868
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
that starting the render i.e. the wait

3869
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
for hours button can feel relieving

3870
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
at some times and anxiety inducing

3871
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
at others but this is the this is the

3872
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
interesting part do you have do any of you

3873
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
also feel a specific way

3874
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
when you initiate that process wait I

3875
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
read that question wrong I thought it was do you

3876
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
have a ritual that you do when you start

3877
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
that process I'm gonna answer that question

3878
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
because I like it better yes I

3879
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I relaxed

3880
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I crack open

3881
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
a big

3882
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
glass of water skull I smash

3883
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
a glass of water

3884
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
to get the jagged it I fill with water I take

3885
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
a long deep draft

3886
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
think that's the word for drink of it

3887
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I just lie down I just lie down

3888
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
drink drink there well

3889
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I'm trying to flex my words

3890
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I just I just

3891
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'm trying to express how relieved and

3892
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
great I feel when I'm finally rendering

3893
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
a video it's such a wonderful feeling for

3894
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
me you really

3895
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
you really remind me of the youtuber

3896
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
CGP gray in a lot of ways

3897
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
though though if you just took gray but

3898
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
removed all like if you took name

3899
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
removed all memes sure

3900
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
get CGP gray okay

3901
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
he's super methodical

3902
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I think it would really behoove you to listen to the first episode

3903
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
of hillarine if you would get super inspired

3904
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
he's very Spartan and

3905
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
he does not

3906
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
have anything unnecessary in his house

3907
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I'm gonna write that down

3908
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
yeah if you were to like create a

3909
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
spectrum of like

3910
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
robot internet celebrities and CGP

3911
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
gray is like pretty far in one

3912
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
end and then like Maddox is completely

3913
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
on the opposite end as far as you can possibly

3914
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
go Nate is like

3915
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
super like closer to CGP gray but

3916
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
more in the middle I would say

3917
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
robots

3918
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
it's just how to deal

3919
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
you know I was thinking about this I was

3920
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
is this a thing I was thinking about dry

3921
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
comedy and I'm like now man I'm into that

3922
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
wet comedy I'm

3923
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I was at you I came

3924
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
with that when I was like 12 okay that's

3925
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
part of my I didn't I just want to say

3926
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
somebody said that that spectrum that

3927
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Davoo just described like I was trying to

3928
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
think like what is the meaningful

3929
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
like putting those two people on opposite ends

3930
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
of spectrum and it's just like literally

3931
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
an insanity bar and he's putting you

3932
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
in the middle of the insanity bar like

3933
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
everyone here is insane just in like

3934
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
well all of them are like human robots

3935
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
but like CGP gray has actually

3936
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
like completely thought out every

3937
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
element of his and is like

3938
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
actually just maximum efficient where it's

3939
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
yours is like a somewhat warped like

3940
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
halfway there like yeah I'm working on it

3941
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
you know

3942
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
yeah it's like if your robots fucking

3943
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
CGP gray is like running like perfectly

3944
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
corrected Linux and Maddox is running

3945
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
like some fucking malware

3946
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
my techniques and it's just a window

3947
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
like he's a window it's not

3948
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
a lean machine but he keeps the desktop

3949
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
clean you know what I'm saying that's true

3950
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
beautiful so my technique

3951
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
for how to deal with the render is have a dopey premiere

3952
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
because it renders shit I think

3953
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
literally 10 times faster though every

3954
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
times in Virginia when like Ben was

3955
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
having to borrow my computer for rendering

3956
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Ben was like hey Davoo I gotta like render

3957
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
this video literally all day okay

3958
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
hold on give me a second to render this other

3959
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
video extremely quickly in Adobe Premiere

3960
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
before you turn on Sony Vegas and take

3961
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
all day on rendering or something I actually

3962
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
there's actually something fucked up with my computer

3963
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
because I assembled it myself and then

3964
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
shipped it around the country three goddamn

3965
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
times so the fan

3966
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
the CPU fan isn't quite fixed right so

3967
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I had to throttle the power of the

3968
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
CPU to only work at like

3969
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
80% of its capacity

3970
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
until I could get that fan fixed

3971
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
and even still Adobe Premiere

3972
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
renders videos like five times faster

3973
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
than Vegas would

3974
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
so use Adobe Premiere to take the edge off

3975
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
yep makes sense to me

3976
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
agreed never um

3977
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
when I render video but maybe

3978
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
it's usually just like a sigh of relief like

3979
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
yeah because I I mean

3980
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I edit really fast and I just tried it

3981
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
like for me it's like the second I've made

3982
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
the last edit if I I mean

3983
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
well if I've watched it back

3984
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
enough times that I don't want to have to watch the entire thing again

3985
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
because chances are I watch it like

3986
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
over and over again the whole time

3987
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I'm editing it so I know it's

3988
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
done you know and then you write

3989
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
you don't understand it with Adobe Premiere

3990
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
render so fast I can just

3991
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
render it before having to

3992
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
watch it back I'll watch it back in the render

3993
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
and redo the render sometimes

3994
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I just don't even bother because like

3995
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
they the preview window can be so shit

3996
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
in Vegas that like it's not even

3997
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
you know it's actually I'm just looking back

3998
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
at one's actual question and he's asking

3999
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
like it could feel relieving it sometimes and anxiety

4000
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
inducing at other times I

4001
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
would assume that the anxiety part I mean

4002
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
like getting a project done is just like pure

4003
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
good feelings for me but the render

4004
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
itself I remember when I was rendering

4005
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
my my big funnel fancy lecture recently

4006
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
that was like over a 24-hour render

4007
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
so like that was very anxiety

4008
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
inducing because I was afraid of knocking

4009
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
my fucking connections and killing it

4010
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
so I had to start all over in that sense

4011
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
sure it could be anxiety

4012
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
inducing I think it

4013
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
can be anxiety inducing

4014
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
when

4015
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
you're not able to like

4016
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
you're not at your fullest

4017
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
of brainpower and so you have looked over

4018
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
it to make sure that all the things are right but maybe

4019
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
but you can't convince yourself

4020
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
you can't convince yourself that it's actually

4021
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
correct but you you can't waste

4022
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
all day looking at it so you have to

4023
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
press render but you just you're just not sure

4024
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
good point it hasn't happened a whole lot

4025
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
cause I'm not a mainly video guy

4026
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I have press rendered it's always the same

4027
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I'll press render I like

4028
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
jump up like a fucking gunshot went off

4029
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I like run down the stairs I'll get some food

4030
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
and I'll like I'll like stumble outside

4031
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
just take a long walk while the video

4032
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
renders because I've done my dues I'm not a video

4033
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
person I don't care about editing just

4034
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
like I've done it I've done my dues

4035
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I believe bye and then I fucking run out the door

4036
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
yeah one thing

4037
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I do like doing after I hit render

4038
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
hope we just power didn't go off or something

4039
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
why

4040
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I wanted to say something that was related to him

4041
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
because well when you

4042
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
go ahead you're first ever

4043
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
one thing I do like doing when I

4044
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
hit render is usually

4045
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I have like multiple projects stacked on

4046
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
top of each other and going on

4047
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
like in my brain at the same time

4048
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
so as soon as I've hit render on one

4049
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
thing I'm like okay I can't really use my

4050
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
computer but I really enjoy

4051
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
like figuring out

4052
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
how I can make progress on the next

4053
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
project immediately

4054
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
right if I'm still awake if I'm tired

4055
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
then I go to bed if I'm hungry I get food

4056
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
but I always want to like immediately work

4057
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
on the next thing while the thing is

4058
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
rendering because it's like a big old

4059
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
like time

4060
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
it's it's like it's like a ticking clock

4061
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
you can get stuff done in this time frame

4062
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
that's exactly how I feel that that's why

4063
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
for example I really love working out

4064
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
because working out gives me just an

4065
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
hour and a half generally

4066
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
three days a week that I can't do anything

4067
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
but like just

4068
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
think and I'll generally put on

4069
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
podcast to listen to or something you know

4070
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
what Nate I just realized I have that

4071
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
exact same like time and I really

4072
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
appreciate that but for me it's taking

4073
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
a shit I take extra

4074
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
ordinarily long you're gonna you're gonna get

4075
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
the hemorrhoids if you shit too long dude

4076
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I think it has to do with you being

4077
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
you start he stands up

4078
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I talked to my doctor

4079
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
alright and my doctor said if you take

4080
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
a long time to shit that that I was like

4081
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
wait wait wait you mean just like if

4082
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I'm on the toilet for longer taken

4083
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
a shit that's going to like increase

4084
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
my chance of hemorrhoids just like literally

4085
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
exactly yes that's what it is

4086
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
yeah if you're straining on the toilet

4087
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
yeah I just say it it's the incentive

4088
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
to get off the toilet fast

4089
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I think it happens a lot more if you're

4090
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
in your late teens I don't know about you guys

4091
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
but I used to take super long shits when

4092
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I was in my late teens I would sit in

4093
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
there for like 45 minutes and then like

4094
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
eventually I just I think

4095
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
just because I started eating more I don't

4096
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
know better or my body stopped letting me

4097
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
eat as bad as I was like

4098
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
yeah I shit more

4099
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
if people want I used

4100
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
to do that because I would like get home from work

4101
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
and I have my own bathroom and I'm just

4102
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I didn't even realize it because I was trying to

4103
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
immediately get back to working on videos when I

4104
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
get back from cleaning windows but you know

4105
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
just my body requires break time so it

4106
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
snuck that in under my nose and

4107
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
if someone ever asks just how much time

4108
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
did you spend sitting on the toilet after

4109
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
shitting I could just

4110
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
tell them I got to level 207

4111
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
on candy crush with no power ups

4112
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
indeed so hold on

4113
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
the thing about rendering and nervousness

4114
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I did the only nervousness

4115
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I really have had in my youtube career

4116
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
when it comes to finishing videos

4117
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
it's just that I've it's just for the

4118
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
when I started working for digi and then I have to be

4119
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
sending them off to someone else who could sit

4120
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
it back to be after like a day

4121
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
that's the thing that was like the most

4122
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
difficult is that like you're done with a video

4123
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
but now you have to like wait for a

4124
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
random time for someone else to

4125
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
then see it and then approve or deny it

4126
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
or like you might have to change something

4127
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
and then like I could have completely moved on

4128
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
to a different project by then right

4129
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
but very recently I

4130
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
finally attained enough confidence that I

4131
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
know exactly what digi once that

4132
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
like I don't have to worry about like

4133
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000

4136
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
read this one final question

4137
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
just bear with me for a second it's a little long but I think you'll appreciate it

4138
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
it's from AJ Shoup and here it is

4139
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000

4141
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
that lowly cryptid

4142
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
here's the question

4143
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
my friend orders a big mac

4144
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I say why are you ordering a big mac

4145
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
he says to me he says

4146
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I remember my mom used to get these back in college

4147
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I'm thinking a burger because of mom

4148
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
hmm that's bizarre

4149
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I ask him how life's been

4150
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
oh you know same old same old

4151
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
what a middling response

4152
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I can get something better out of him

4153
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I ask remember that girl you liked

4154
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
