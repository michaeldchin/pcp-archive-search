00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, everybody! You're listening to The Pro Crastinators Podcast! I'm Digibro, and with me is Mage.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello, I am Ithpresent. Yes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And Tom Oliver.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast really lives up to its name because almost everybody procrastinated on even fucking showing up!

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's true, although we were pretty much on time. Actually, we started much earlier.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh wait, did you just mean everybody else who's not here?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, no one's fucking here. It's a goddamn ghost hack.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was punctual as fuck. I got the voicemails done 20 minutes before the show started. Nate!

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean, it's 105 and we're recording. This show usually starts at like 115.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And actually 130 would probably be the closer time. 115 is early. That's what I casted.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's true. We have been drifting late as of recently, which is disgusting, unprofessional, and that's why we kicked everybody out of the podcast except for us.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They had their chance, they failed, and now it's just us forever get used to it.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fuck yeah. Yeah, I saw those motherfuckers at the BronyCon posting videos where they're like, oh Tom, we wish you were here.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tom, I'm so sorry about your back being dead. Digi, you're a piece of shit for not coming here, you faggot.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You don't have an excuse other than your own apathy.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was on the ground floor of BronyCon planned last year. I was like, yes, let's do it.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It was me and Munchie's brainchild of an idea. And at the fucking finish line, third and goal, I dropped the ball and everything goes down.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is that a real football, third and goal? That's like third down. There's less than a yard or something. I think that's how football works.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Someone correct me in the comments, yell at me.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't feel bad because they look like a bunch of boomers trying to relive their glory days.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, it's just you're going there, you're having a good time. There's a bunch of people there that I'm never going to be able to probably see again.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why not? Like who? Well, it's different for you even because you have way more friends in the BronyCon community than any of them.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I don't understand how that's even real. I don't understand how it happened. I just kind of know everybody.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So there's a bunch of people that I would have liked just like, hey, bye.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm just not worried about meeting like the PCP guys because I see them like relatively all the time.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I agree. I mean, it's less, I'm less worried. I'm like, as much as I would like to hang out with the PCP crew again at BronyCon being a boomer.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just saw them like what, like four or five months ago? It's not like it's been forever.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But like everybody else that I usually see at BronyCon and I haven't gone for like three years.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Those are the people that I'm kind of bummed that I'm not going to be able to hang out with.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's why I was saying like it's different for you because it's like we just had that meeting in January where like everybody came, even Hippo.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Except for Jesse, maybe. But like I've gone to Jesse's house directly. I've gone to Nate's house.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I had Ben live with me for like six months. You know, when I lived in Boston, you lived in my house.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ben came by relatively often in Munchy and one time Nate and Hippo fucking flew in while we lived in Boston.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's like, I've seen these guys. I know I'm going to see them again because we're going to do another Radcon.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't want to go to BronyCon.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, if you're not interested in that convention itself, then it makes sense.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But like, I don't know, part of me did want to go. It was the last one.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I see the fun that Nate is having in like taking pictures of himself with Dr. Wolfe.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I get why he thinks that's funny, but that would not be fun for me to do.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not going to go to BronyCon and take a picture with Dr. Wolfe, who I've like really talked shit about on the internet like hardcore for years, you know.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, you'd go and have a fistfight with Dr. Wolfe. It'd be great.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right. Well, like, I think that Nate has always maintained that he tries not to burn bridges with anybody because he wants, even if he thinks of them as like kind of a meme,

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
he still wants to treat them with respect so that he could take pictures with them and like think about it in his mind as a fun thing, you know.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Nate is very non-confrontational in that way.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I can relate.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He will always kind of give everyone the benefit of the doubt, which is probably good in today's interconnected world where you can always kind of like connect with anybody, I suppose.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, I think his mentality is always just kind of like, well, I might not like the guy's content, but I respect the guy and the fact that he's famous and in a way that I think is funny, you know, so I'm going to take pictures with him.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nate has that basic human decency thing that is required of a Starfleet officer that not all of us have, you know.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And like him and Ben both got pictures with Chris Chan, which is awesome. Like, you know, I appreciate what they, again, I have never even read Sonichu.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm not like a hardcore Chris Chan follower. I just know it through Ben's lecture.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ben and Nate have like legitimate connection to Chris Chan. I would love to have pictures with her.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have no such desires. So, yeah, like, it's like, I see why they're all having fun at BronyCon because they still involve themselves in like that community in some way, or there are also all the slymoids who are there.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's like a big part of it. And I don't play the game, you know, I've never played the RFCK. Yeah, the RFCK game.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Endless war.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Right. Endless war. That's the word I was looking for. I have never played Endless War. And so like, when those guys hang out with people from Endless War, that's all they talk about.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Like, when, Tom, you experienced this, because when we were doing IM games, there was one time that we had Ben and Munchy come over in, like, October to record an IM games with us.

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And they came in and all they fucking talked about was Endless War, and you and I had no fucking idea what to say about it.

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And so, like, the IM game stream just became a rowdy fucker's cop killer stream because they were talking about Endless War so much.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And, like, I came to realize that when enough Endless War people hang out together, I really just feel like I have no idea what's going on.

60
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I completely agree. And I keep thinking, like, maybe I should, like, kind of understand what this is. But I mean...

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It takes a lot of time. Like, it's kind of an involved project, especially when it has a lot of history by this point.

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not as incredible as, like, an achievement in terms of just, like, what it's done, but it doesn't change the fact that at the end of the day, like, even though my friends made it, even though it has this big, like, community and, like, all these people I know are kind of tangentially involved in it, it's still a multiplayer game, and I've never liked multiplayer games.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's also a PvP. I don't like PvP.

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't, like, role-playing, you know?

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, no.

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm bored by, like, I don't know. Like, if I role-play, I will probably be, like, the stupidest character, you know?

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like, when I did Dungeons & Dragons and with my friends, I was a nigger Rafiki, and I had 5,000 bottles of liquor that I throw at enemies, and, like, that I only would solve problems through liquor.

68
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And, like, it doesn't really work in the game.

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I feel like that would fit in with Endless War.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Maybe it would.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Everybody in Endless War is an insane character.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Like, from what it sounds with Endless War, I think I would like it just generally.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like, I like slimes, and, like, mining slimes sounds like a cool idea.

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If I could just, like, if I could just, not being bothered to just mine slimes all day, I would probably play it, but I don't want to be attacked by people.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Right. That sounds like it takes a lot of time, or at least a lot of, like, opening that browser again and again, and, like, I don't know, man, I have all my servers on hardcore mute on Discord.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Like, I'm not somebody who wants to spend a lot of time on Discord because I fucking try to work way too much, you know?

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So, like, the idea of, like, a high effort Discord communication circle.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like, I know you probably can be a fairly passive player in the game, but it's just, like, what's exciting about the game is the culture.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's the amount of shit coming out of it.

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, if you're not really down to, like, pay that much attention to it, I don't feel like you're going to really get the appeal

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that those guys are getting out of it, which I have nothing but respect for, but, like, I don't get it.

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, I have no idea what they're talking about when fucking they talk about it.

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So, I just kind of feel like the odd man out, especially when I see that there's, like, that many people from the game.

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Like, it's basically a meetup for RFCK at that point, you know?

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because I saw they had pictures where they're hanging out with, like, a ton of the people who have been at other meetups and shit like that.

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I am glad, though, what's working out for the guys and, like, the game's popular and people seem to love it.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It seems fun.

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just, it's...

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They've definitely tapped into that cult mentality, which is what I longed to be able to cultivate with my own stuff,

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
because that's where the true power lies, is having a group of brainwashed young children to do your bidding for you.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, god.

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, did you went to Otacon, right?

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

95
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How did that go?

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was great time.

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is that still at the Baltimore Convention Center?

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They moved by now?

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, a couple years ago, they moved to the DC convention and, like, convention center.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I had heard that it wasn't as good in DC from my brother, Victor, who basically, I think he had had a hotel maybe in the wrong part of town,

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and he, like, was just upset that there were no street vendors outside, like there are at the Baltimore Convention Center,

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
because he likes to go and eat, like, the street hot dogs and spend no money and go no distance, you know?

104
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Right.

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But, like, maybe he had other complaints, but I don't remember what he had said, because I thought the DC venue was fucking awesome.

106
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like, it was in the heart of, like, the best part of DC, and it's within walking distance of the White House, the Washington Monument,

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the Congress building, the fucking, the Capitol building, like, you know, you're in the heart of the sightseeing part of DC.

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's even, like, a Smithsonian Museum.

109
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This gigantic fucking park that's, like, fucking probably three times the size of the Boston Park, which is a nice park, you know?

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I love parks.

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, big, beautiful park that goes on forever and has all these fucking monuments by it.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, like, it's basically a fun trip to DC to see all the bullshit.

113
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know, I didn't do that much of that, but we ended up walking around for, like, an hour on Thursday night, just sightseeing DC, because why not?

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And then, like, and there's also fuckloads of food all around the convention.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, it was like, if you wanted to do things other than the convention, you'd be well-spoken for, but there was a lot going on at the convention,

116
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
so we mostly were doing that, because it was, like, tons of Japanese guests that I'm a fan of, which is, like, that's really what I turn up to cons for the most,

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is, like, getting to meet the, you know, creators behind different anime that I'm a fan of.

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, like, you know, in the case of My Little Pony, there was a time when I cared more about, like, meeting the creators of the show,

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
though, like, none of them have really done a lot outside of MLP that I'm a fan of, you know?

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Whereas with, like, an anime director, they might have done, like, ten fucking shows that I like or something, you know?

121
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, I've never, in the time since I haven't been keeping up with MLP, I have not followed any of the people who worked on it, you know?

122
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like, I'm just an anime guy now. I do not watch My Little Pony or care about it.

123
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was going to ask if you still keep up with the show. What about you, Tom? Do you still keep up with the show?

124
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've watched episodes here and there. I actually was planning on trying to get caught up before BronyCon,

125
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but then I forgot because I was busy working on game stuff and I just totally slipped my mind, which I guess was for the best,

126
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because it didn't even end up fucking going, because I wanted to go and, like, know what was going on.

127
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Because the last time I went to a pony convention was, I think, 2016 or something, and I was already, like, way out of the loop at that point,

128
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
so I had no idea what was going on at the convention. There was a bunch of art and shit.

129
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Like, what the fuck are we talking about? And the show is totally different now, apparently.

130
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like, there's a whole new, like, B cast and everything.

131
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's a lot of, yeah, new characters. I'm actually, I actually yesterday just finished catching up.

132
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, the show's also, like, ending soon, right?

133
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I think that's, this is the last season on episode 20, so, like, I think it's a few episodes away from ending.

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a really weird atmosphere to me to have, like, this idea of, like, oh, it's the last brony con, like, around the last season of the show,

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and, like, most of the people at the convention are still just, like, doing that shit full time, you know?

136
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like, Dr. Wolfe and KP are there because they still make my little pony videos regularly, like, for money, you know?

137
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So, like, from my perspective, it's like, I fucking have not even involved myself in this in, like, five years, you know?

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So this is a totally different experience for me versus people who are going here because they're sincerely still watching the show

139
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and still interested, you know, still watching Dr. Wolfe analysis videos.

140
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Like, I haven't even watched a new episode since halfway through season five, and I have not gone back to watch it again.

141
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They're sort of trying to wrap up loose ends with the show from what I've noticed.

142
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, how Twilight, you know, freaks out whenever she gets nervous or organized or whatever.

143
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Man, that's still a thing.

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, no more. Like, actually, there was one episode where she freaked out, made her heart hold on.

145
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I think I have an image that I showed by her because she was making so many stupid faces.

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The animation was very weird in that episode. I'm not sure if it was just that episode or it was just noticeable in that episode.

147
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But just, yeah, she was freaking out really hard.

148
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then the next episode was like, you know, I learned my lesson. I'm not going to freak out anymore.

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And she didn't. And I guess that puts a pin in that thread, I guess.

150
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Until another writer writes the next episode and forgets everything that happened.

151
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The show usually does.

152
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, but like, if this is the last season and then, you know, this was like almost at the end of the season.

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So I think, yeah, she's going to stop freaking out.

154
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Also, major spoilers if you haven't caught up.

155
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, she's going to be, she's going to take over Luna's and Celestia's role now because those two are retiring.

156
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay, whatever.

157
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Fucking, I've been alive for like 10 billion years, but now the show's ending.

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We got to wrap everything up in a nice pretty bow.

159
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, the two sisters are just like, you know, we did this.

160
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We just want to go chill.

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And they actually had an episode where they went on vacation and that didn't go too well.

162
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But yeah, the show is just going which way direction doing things.

163
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's kind of interesting to see. I'm not saying the show is better or worse or whatever.

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's just different.

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm stunned it lasted as long as it did.

166
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you had told me going in like back in like 2012, it's like, yeah, the show's going to be going like through 2019.

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'd be like, no, no.

169
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I feel like I have a different expectation just for that because I never watched a lot of long running American cartoons growing up,

170
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
like other than stuff on Cartoon Network, you know, that like stuff like Ed and Nettie or Dexter's Lab that was around for a long time.

171
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But I did eventually watch it end.

172
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know, like those shows lasted maybe like five or six years, maybe even 10 years.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like as Ed and Nettie kind of came back for a little while and had a proper conclusion.

174
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So like I've seen shows not last this long, but like I'm mostly used to watching anime where shows literally go for like 13 to 26 episodes,

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
maybe 50 and that's like a huge show.

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

177
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And for me, it's like considered a huge investment to go watch like all of Ereka 7 or all of Mobile Suit Gundam, the original, you know,

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
much less watching like like the amount of episodes of My Little Pony at this point.

179
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There's got to be like what?

180
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
A lot.

181
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There's over 100.

182
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I mean, episode 100 was like three years ago, wasn't it?

183
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Right.

184
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There has to be like fucking close to 200 episodes, right?

185
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And that's not even counting the spin-offs and stuff.

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's like watching like the whole Macross franchise or something, you know, like, like I could watch an amount of anime that would feel like an impossible amount of anime

187
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
in the time it would take to watch all of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic at this point.

188
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I've only seen less than half of it, which is really weird to think about because it's like I was so into the show for those four years that the idea that there would come a time where I had seen

189
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
less than half of this show would be would be, you know, like no way.

190
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But like the show definitely did change as it went on.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I just didn't really care about it anymore.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, like it felt like it was too different or too watered down or like just, you know, repetitive.

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like even if even sometimes the episodes were good, but it was just like this point's already been made before.

194
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And like we're kind of going around in circles.

195
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah.

196
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I feel like we've already had enough good episodes that I feel like I got a satisfying show out of it.

197
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know, I don't feel like I have to wait another seven seasons.

198
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'd rather just end it now and remember it as good, you know.

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think I think MLP suffers from the same problem that most like Western cartoons and just like, I don't know, just like the Western model of entertainment.

200
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Because this is a huge issue.

201
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just go until you fail.

202
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And comic books as well is that they have they have properties with time.

203
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
There's too many people in the kitchen, right?

204
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There's like what like probably there's been over 20 writers over the course of MLP.

205
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You go to comic books and like a character is written by like five different people over the course of like, you know, a couple years.

206
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So there's no coherent singular creative vision behind a lot of these properties.

207
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

208
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You know, like you go read Spider-Man.

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Like depending on which book you pick up, it's written by a different person.

210
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So the character is completely different.

211
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The story is different.

212
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The tone is different.

213
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So it's just like,

214
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But it's a sequel to the previous guys work.

215
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Right.

216
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it'll help guys like,

217
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
what they didn't like about the last guy's story.

218
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's just,

219
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know.

220
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It just alters the story into something that can just continue in whatever way.

221
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And then when you explain the story to somebody, you have to explain all those changes, you know,

222
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you have to say like,

223
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, well, the reason this doesn't make sense is that this author completely changed everything about the character.

224
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah.

225
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And MLP did the same thing when Lauren left and Megan McCarthy took over and there's, you know, there's like,

226
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
every season has like at least five or six different writers and there's no singular coherent plot going through it.

227
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So it's just like,

228
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it's the same trappings that all these kind of things do here in the West when we make stories.

229
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's just like a clusterfuck.

230
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

231
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It was like that.

232
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But like from what I've watched now, it could be wrong since I was drawing and watching at the same time.

233
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I haven't been paying too much attention, but I was, I was watching.

234
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think they started getting their ducks in a row with the last few seasons, like maybe the last season.

235
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And they're like the main six, they're sort of passing on their torch to the younger generation of the students.

236
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The Twilight has it has a school now, if you didn't know.

237
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

238
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah.

239
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So it's just, and there sort of been, I guess a bit more consistent or at least it seems like that because the focus of the episodes are less on the main six

240
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and more on other characters that are, they, they managed to keep in line.

241
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's really interesting to me that they did that because like I had said way the fuck back in like 2013.

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I said, like if this show continues on, I wanted this to happen by like season four or five because I had felt like season four, like pretty much wraps up any outstanding character arcs and like most

243
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and a lot of them just kind of repeat by that point.

244
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Like a lot of the arcs had already wrapped up in season three and they just kind of repeated their same kind of point in season four.

245
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So that was why I had started to feel like it was getting repetitive and I was losing interest because I felt like we had completed most of these character arcs.

246
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But I had said what they need to do is just like establish the cutie mark crusaders as like a six person team because they had mentioned having three more of them in like main

247
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Manhattan or whatever that there was like a second sect of the, the, the, the fucking I forgot the, the CMC.

248
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah.

249
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So I was saying like they should be the new generation and just like, you know, move on to making them characters.

250
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And that did not happen when I wanted it to, but it did happen later, which is really interesting, but they didn't give it to them.

251
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It just like made six new characters.

252
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

253
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They're all different species and made those like the new real characters who they could give like a new development arc to.

254
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But, you know, like by that point, I just kind of am not interested enough in the show as a whole to have continued watching it, you know.

255
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

256
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean, at some point, I probably will finish it just to say my own curiosity.

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They finally understand that I could see doing that in like, in like 10 years, if I for some reason ran out of everything else to watch.

258
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And I was just like, man, I really want to know what happens at the end of my little pony.

259
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But like, well, here, here's the thing, dude, with like MLP, like the interesting thing with it is that since it's in English, you can just like listen to it while you're doing something else.

260
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's what I'm doing.

261
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yep.

262
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I also like, I had like plans at one point to cover the Japanese dub of MLP because of the fact that it had a bunch of voice actresses from like anime that I am a fan of.

263
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So like, I was planning to do like a cover of the OP to open the video.

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Like this is when they first started jumping in Japanese like 2014, probably maybe late 2013.

265
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And yeah, I was going to do like a whole project just to talk about the Japanese dub and how like as an anime fan, that was the one that was more fun for me to watch.

266
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Though it was, you know, not better than the English version because the voice acting is pretty good in the show.

267
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But like, you know, yeah, I always forget that you can watch American shows in English and it makes it much easier to just leave on in the background.

268
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It still would take a lot though to watch all of the fucking show, you know.

269
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It is fucking long.

270
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yep.

271
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Like even watching Yu-yu Hakusho dubbed, it takes like a week of concentrated effort to do, you know.

272
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Shit's fucking long, dude.

273
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Tom, did you hear when I said Skoodle's parents have been revealed?

274
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm not sure if you're interested in that, but.

275
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Um, I did not know that that happened, but you telling me does not surprise me.

276
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I feel like that's, especially if you're saying they're wrapping everything up, that's like one of the big things that they must have had to get to at some point.

277
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So, yeah, there's just, again, like just to save my curiosity to be like, ah, yes, that thing that I was thinking about way too deeply back in 2012.

278
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
They finally gave me an answer and it was subpar, not as good as the ideas I had in my head.

279
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
God damn you show for five year olds not living up to my adult expectations.

280
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And that's, that's another funny thing about it is that like when we, when you and I in particular, when we were in the Brony community,

281
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:48,000
like you and I read a lot more of like the fan fix and shit and saw the like really great nuanced takes that some people had on the characters that like made it more interesting to be a part of the fandom

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because you kind of have the show and how you associate the characters there.

283
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then like a different way of thinking about them because of the fact that certain people in the fandom would write like really, you know, basically just good fiction that happens to feature some element of the show.

284
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's the same thing every artist does.

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Like I have this great idea.

286
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How can I get people to actually pay attention to it?

287
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, I'll just make a fan work.

288
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Or just how do I make it like while I'm still learning how to make my own thing?

289
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Like a lot of the times, a lot of the usefulness that came out of yours and my videos to people was that we had like a lot of people who would say like, I'm a fanfic author and like listening to you break down how the world works has helped me to like, you know, to like conceptualize how I would build a fictional world.

290
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You know, and so like a lot of those people would then write an MLP fanfic as a way to like, like just basically deconstruct the world building for themselves and then go and try to write their own world based on that.

291
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And like, I was shocked how many comments like that we would both get, you know, especially on shit like our weird lore videos and stuff.

292
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, I guess that is like people prime to watch that kind of content in the first place.

293
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I had I had such a cool idea for a MLP comic that I wanted to do, but then I didn't end up did not doing it.

294
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But it was going to be like a bit darker than usual.

295
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It started off, I actually had a first page somewhere finished.

296
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I started off with this one pony just like going to dig for diamonds, but then she discovers some big old evil that and she accidentally releases it and just causes like a dystopian in the pony world.

297
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
She has to travel around and find other ponies who haven't lost their spark, so to speak, to restore the world to how it used to be.

298
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It sounds like Dark Souls.

299
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This was before Dark Souls.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
At least I never.

301
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Hold on.

302
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I have this.

303
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Hold on.

304
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I found the first page.

305
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The only page I actually do.

306
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Dig up some ancient mage art word.

307
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It was interesting how the show really was like such fertile ground for a crazy fan work and stuff.

308
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I even started a fan fiction of Fallout Equestria.

309
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Somebody came up to me at Otacon and told me like I've been following you for, you know, since the Brony days and I'm like, I might have even been.

310
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:29,000
There was this dude's son of Marowak who hung out with me for a while at Otacon and said he was going to BronyCon too and he was really excited to meet like Hippo and Jesse.

311
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because he was like slowly, he was like currently branching out through the PCPs stuff like like investigating everybody's channels like because he's like a Brony but I guess he wasn't really around in the pony days because he's also a huge anime fan and that's how he knows about me, you know.

312
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But like he's moving his way through watching like the horseshoe saga and shit.

313
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So like, which is like to think that that's still happening in 2019 is really impressive, you know, that like people still are like, yeah, well, I just, you know, I am both of my little pony fan and a fan of the PCP so I'm going to go back and watch those videos and like get the full effect of them, you know.

314
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But like, fuck, I forgot like why I brought him up.

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He wanted to meet Hippo.

316
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I remember you.

317
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, just that he's going to.

318
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's the guy.

319
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Which guy?

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You're talking about the guy who you said he wanted to meet Hippo, right?

321
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, what is this thing that's loading though?

322
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That was the page.

323
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's just it's not loading.

324
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If you click on it, you can see it.

325
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It doesn't look for me.

326
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
At least when I click it, it looks good.

327
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It looks good.

328
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It looks good.

329
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's very it's show accurate.

330
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Definitely a far cry from what you draw today.

331
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, definitely.

332
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It is very show accurate though.

333
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Thank you.

334
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I tried really hard back then.

335
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, well, I guess I was I don't fucking remember why I was talking about that.

336
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I lost track of thought.

337
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He left a good impression on you.

338
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, no son of Meruac was a cool guy.

339
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't remember like I just wanted to bring up why he was going to both cons, but I don't

340
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
remember to what end you started saying how it's interesting how even now like our old

341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
work like getting people like into our like videos and like seeing the horseshoe saga

342
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and how even today people are still kind of going down that rabbit hole.

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, but I don't I feel like I was there was a going to be a twist on it at some point

344
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I forgot what the twist was that I was going for something.

345
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Fuck.

346
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So forget about it.

347
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, the twist is you'll never know what the twist was audience.

348
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

349
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, fuck Barone Khan.

350
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm not salty that I'm not there at all.

351
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm sorry, Tom.

352
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I really do think I I totally appreciate why those guys felt so bad about you not getting

353
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
to go because it really would have meant more to you than anybody else in the PCP since

354
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
you do know people in that community.

355
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah.

356
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Like, I know you would have hung out with like Jack's Blade and AC Race Best or something.

357
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Like, yeah, I mean, I would have seen all those guys like apparently because I was talking

358
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to them like leading up to this as well.

359
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I was going to drive in with Matt and like Saber is like, oh, yeah, like we rented like

360
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
a private suite for the first night.

361
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So we're all going to have a party up there and like you can come and I was like, oh,

362
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
sick.

363
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Like, and it didn't happen.

364
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Like, do any of those guys still watch MLP?

365
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Or is it just an excuse to hang out with each other every year?

366
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like, they do.

367
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
They still they're still caught up.

368
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's amazing because I'm going to chat with a bunch of them on Discord as well.

369
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Like they'll ping each other every now and then and be like, oh, yeah, we're going to

370
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
watch a new episode.

371
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So like, yeah, they're up on it.

372
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
They're still involved in certain ways.

373
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
They go to all the conventions and shit.

374
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Like they get they're still like part of that click.

375
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So like, you know, like Barone Khan invited them over because like, I feel like there

376
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
are a lot of groups who like even as of like 2013 or 14 when I went to Barone Khan for

377
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the first couple of times, there were people there who were like not even into it anymore.

378
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They were just there to hang out with friends, you know, like that was already rampant at

379
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Barone Khan.

380
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And that was how it was for us in 2015.

381
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We're like, none of us were talking about it anymore.

382
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We just were still kind of auxiliary about Barone famous, I guess.

383
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And like, yeah, we just wanted to hang out together, you know, I mean, that's why in

384
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Barone Khan as well, like the people right there right now, the PCP boys, it's not

385
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
right, like they're all just there to hang out with each other.

386
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But there are people there who are like still, you know, connected deeply to the show and

387
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
are meeting up because it's like, oh, yeah, we still watch it.

388
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We're still a part of this community.

389
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is still, you know, part of our identity and stuff.

390
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like that's why it's just an interesting.

391
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's an interesting event from the outside to see that there's some people there who

392
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
are like still really into it.

393
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Some people there who are just there to see friends or even have completely unrelated

394
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
meetups about like RFCK, which has nothing to do with My Little Pony in any way.

395
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We don't like plenty of people involved with it have never watched My Little Pony.

396
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm sure, you know, like, but would still go to Barone Khan to see the PCP.

397
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So, you know, I know there are some people who are probably there just for that who

398
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
probably would have wanted to see me more, you know, like then Bronies would have wanted

399
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to like who don't know who the fuck I am at all, you know, at this point.

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But like there would have been like PCP fans, but I met a bunch of those people at Otakana

401
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
as well.

402
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So like, you know, I met a whole lot of my like big fans because of the fact that obviously

403
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
most fans of me are huge fans of anime.

404
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So like, you know, I hung out with a couple of people who were really cool and part of

405
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Sara, who gave me weed.

406
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So that was fucking cool.

407
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, we're smoking up on the hotel in fucking Washington, D.C.

408
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It was beautiful outside.

409
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Fucking.

410
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, it was it was fun to hang out with them.

411
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And like D.C. was a great place.

412
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It was like Otakana was a lot of fun for me.

413
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I got like everything I could have wanted out of convention, even like the fan interaction

414
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and like hanging out with people you know, because like I don't particularly know Paru

415
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and I definitely didn't know Son of Marowak, but like they they seemed cool.

416
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And like I knew of Paru from like my discord, you know, so it's not like I had no idea who

417
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
this person is.

418
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Whereas at Bronicon, there will be a lot of people who would be following us around who

419
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
we don't really know.

420
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And that was kind of what made me like I thought it was cool for us to have like this posse

421
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
around us of all these people who are like just kind of following us around because they

422
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
think we're the most interesting thing going on.

423
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But I don't know most of those people and I can't really do things with them around,

424
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
you know.

425
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And like that was kind of the motivation to do Radcon in the first place was like, hey,

426
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
we've meet up at Bronicon all the time, but we can't really record things here.

427
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like we can't make cool shit together.

428
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it's fun to be around all these people we don't know, but like we also want to just

429
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
hang out together, you know, and just do things like because we're friends, like play video

430
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
games together, you know, like we can't do that at Bronicon.

431
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But like when we hang out at a place that's most of what we do really is like we find

432
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
every excuse to do let's plays because we all love just hanging out and playing video

433
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
games and talking, you know.

434
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So like to me that's if it's like, oh, Bronicon versus Radcon, I would much rather do Radcon

435
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
because it's me and my bros hanging out playing video games and fucking just shooting the shit.

436
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Bronicon is like a weird event where you're going to be like a celebrity and followed

437
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
around by people, you know, and a lot of them are going to be people who you only know through

438
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
this game that I don't play.

439
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So I have no idea what the fuck they're talking about, you know.

440
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So like that's kind of why I didn't want to go.

441
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's like, again, I appreciate why Tom wants to go so much.

442
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But like for the rest of the PCP, it's like I understand why this is more appealing to

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
you because you know more of these people who you're hanging out with.

444
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't know any of these people.

445
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'd rather just hang out with you guys.

446
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I think we're going to do that probably by the end of the year.

447
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm sure we'll be able to organize another Radcon.

448
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Like that was this point because we made sure you're going to go to Radcon.

449
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm going to not be a quitter.

450
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't know.

451
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't know.

452
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Like if we're doing it, we're obviously doing it by Kickstarter.

453
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I think that we should really like, I don't know, I think we should aim a little higher

454
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
than we had last time just because like we could afford better accommodations, you know,

455
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
or like just to be able.

456
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know.

457
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The Airbnb worked out pretty well.

458
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But like if we could get that like somewhere like where like if we could get that and get

459
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
everybody like make sure everybody's flight is covered and everything, which I think we

460
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
did last time, right?

461
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Like, yeah, it was covered last time.

462
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We had to like make some last minute concessions to balance the books like after the fact.

463
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But that's the thing.

464
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like I think we need to ask for more just to have like everything cost more than you

465
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
expected to.

466
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And like, we never really account for it because we're trying so hard to be as transparent

467
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
as possible and be like, you know, hey, the funds go up by 150 like like the stretch goal

468
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
of $150 is that another guy gets to fly down.

469
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So you can very visibly see that that stretch goal is just to cover that flight.

470
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But like everything ends up costing more than you think it does.

471
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Just because you don't realize like a light bulb goes out in the house because you're

472
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
overloading the electricity or something.

473
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You got to go buy a new light bulb or just we're hiring Vic as a cameraman.

474
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But can we feed him?

475
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, he has nowhere to go and no money like, you know, just there's reasons that

476
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it costs more.

477
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So we should make sure that we don't put ourselves at a deficit, which we've done each time that

478
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
we've done a Kickstarter.

479
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah, I think the best thing to do for this upcoming rad con to prevent that is to not

480
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
go so ham on the stretch goals like we did last time.

481
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We just need to set like the stretch goals were kind of fine and that they were just

482
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
like video.

483
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Like I feel like we accomplished everything that we had said.

484
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It took a long time to get like everything edited, but we did record all that stuff at

485
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
rad con.

486
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So it felt like we had at least accomplished what the goals were.

487
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But yeah, it did just go over budget.

488
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's like we need to factor in the budget of anything we're planning to do, but then

489
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
also just have like a deposit of like, like how about everybody gets paid to have done

490
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
rad con?

491
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Like not just that it covers the cost of it, but that you actually get paid to do it,

492
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you know, because that's why nobody feels like editing the shit afterwards is because

493
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
we've we've made enough money to fund rad con, but there's no residual.

494
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There's no like, oh, you also get a hundred dollars for the time that you're going to

495
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
be working on editing those videos.

496
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You know, it's like for us, there's no more benefit of cost.

497
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
There's no additional payment that we get for also doing the stuff afterwards, which

498
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
is the hard part of the work because I mean you by yourself.

499
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Right now we're doing a regular episode and we're going to get paid for it through

500
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Patreon.

501
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Right.

502
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Not only did we not get paid for anything we did at rad con at all because we lost

503
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
money at the end of the day, but that following week we didn't do an actual PCP episode because

504
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
we were busy getting everything squared away from rad con.

505
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So we lost even more money because no one made money that week either.

506
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Right.

507
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,500
And like granted, we do make some extra money through like super chats and shit that we

508
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,000
do during the thing, but we don't get that money till much later, you know, so and it

509
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
kind of comes in.

510
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I mean, it's just related to that stream and you don't really feel like that's additionally

511
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
contributing to you editing this video that is now going to definitely be made at a deficit

512
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
because you know it's not going to get a lot of views.

513
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You know, it's not going to be drawing new people to the channel.

514
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It exists to be something cool for the fans, you know, like the people who really care

515
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
about the PCP are the ones watching the rad con videos, not people who are just stopping

516
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in to to hear a random podcast, you know.

517
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Right.

518
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So like I definitely think it's like, yeah, we just need to charge a little not charge,

519
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but like set our goals a little higher.

520
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And like maybe I mean, I still think we can offer like higher tier rewards, but like we

521
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
definitely have to factor the cost of the rewards into the total cost because did we

522
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
even do that with rad con three with all the shirts and shit?

523
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Like, is that why we went over budget?

524
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The biggest problem that would fuck us over going over budget was the international shipping

525
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
on those shirts.

526
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's something I had to factor in with.

527
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I ran because did you know that I just sold fucking 50 shirts?

528
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I did not know.

529
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Did you go versus Kirito shirts?

530
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah, 50.

531
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's fucking great.

532
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Dude, fucking I sold them.

533
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Okay.

534
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So here's how I did it.

535
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I ran some experimental runs to figure out what it was going to cost because like I bought

536
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
basically when I overheard you telling Ben that the t-shirt press was like $200, I had

537
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
just always assumed it was expensive and that I needed to rely on the fact that you had

538
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
one to make shirts.

539
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
When I found out that I could just buy one for myself for relatively cheap, I was like,

540
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
well, well, I can just make my own shirts and I can just do it whenever the fuck I want

541
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because I don't have to commission anybody and I can just experiment with random designs,

542
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
print them out and put them on shirts and see what happens.

543
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Heat press isn't hard to use the heat press.

544
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh my God, I fucking love.

545
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's like I've always wanted to have like a DIY collection of clothes.

546
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Like I want to make a bunch of goofy shirts that just have slogans on them and shit and

547
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
wear them in videos because it would be really cool to just have like a constant array of

548
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
different shirts that are all made by me.

549
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah, I would love to have that like just t-shirts with my own designs.

550
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It is not expensive to do this.

551
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Get a heat press mage.

552
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's not hard.

553
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Buying 50 t-shirts is like what, 100 something, 150 maybe, something like that.

554
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's like over $100 to buy the baseline.

555
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, you make that bad quickly if you sell these, but like even if you just want them

556
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
for yourself, you can buy 50 blank t-shirts to fuck with for a hundred bucks, you know,

557
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and just fuck with them.

558
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You can go even cheaper than that.

559
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like if you want to sell things, like if you like what you're doing right now, did you,

560
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
like getting the heat press makes total sense, but like mage, if you want to just make custom

561
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
t-shirts, all you have to do is go to a craft store and buy iron on heat transfer paper.

562
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So it's the same kind of paper you're using.

563
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh yeah, you could just use a regular iron.

564
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You don't even have to get a fucking shirt press.

565
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You just print out on the special paper and just use an iron and you iron on that design

566
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
onto a white t-shirt and it's, you're done.

567
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Wash off with several washes of the washing machine though.

568
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It depends on the quality of the paper you get.

569
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Sometimes the iron on stuff works okay, but not great.

570
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Like that's why people usually get a heat press if you want to do it professionally,

571
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
because the heat press gets much hotter than an iron.

572
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So the designs are transferred better and they last longer.

573
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But if you're just, you know, you're just digging around.

574
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You're just going to wear like a shirt casually around the house.

575
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah.

576
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I mean, look up like iron on a shirt tutorial.

577
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It is much easier than you would probably imagine, because it's just applying heat to

578
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it for like 20 seconds, you know?

579
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The only reason it's harder with an iron is that you have to go over the whole image

580
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
like piece by piece, whereas with a heat press, it just presses the whole thing on it once.

581
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And it only takes 20 fucking seconds.

582
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So like it takes way longer to print out the images.

583
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
If you have a like, in my case, I had a really detailed picture with lots of color in it.

584
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So it took like eight minutes to print each page.

585
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But what sort of printer do you need for it though?

586
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Just any kind of regular printer.

587
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
In fact, the specific paper that I got on Amazon cannot use a laser printer.

588
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So I couldn't go to any print stores to get it printed.

589
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And my printer was acting up initially.

590
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So this is why I was being so experimental with it, like that I was not trying to sell

591
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
anything right off the bat because it took a long time to even figure out how the fuck

592
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
to work all this stuff.

593
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But like basically I got my printer working.

594
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I just needed new ink in it.

595
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And, you know, the ink was probably the most expensive part of the process because my image

596
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
used a lot of ink.

597
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So I probably went through like five ink cartridges.

598
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But I was buying the cheap repro car cartridges from, you know, like from Target because

599
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
they have like $30 for a refill as opposed to 50, you know.

600
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
All right.

601
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm going to what you need to do.

602
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Digi, if you're going to keep doing this, you need to go on eBay.

603
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You're going to search for your printer model, like the cartridge that it uses, refillable

604
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
cartridges.

605
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's what I have for my printer here.

606
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You just buy a bottle of ink that's like massive and it's, it's like a thousand reloads and

607
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
it's like $10 and then you just take a needle and you inject it into the cart and refill

608
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
it.

609
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And so it's like a thousand cartridges.

610
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, you need a needle?

611
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

612
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's, it's a lot.

613
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I mean, all you do is like, it's just you put the needle in the bottle, you fill it up

614
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and then you inject it again in the cartridge.

615
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It takes like as long as you need to even say that.

616
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Sure.

617
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But like you're not, you're not shooting yourself up with fucking printer ink.

618
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Still though.

619
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's just like really technical for a layman such as me, but you know, I don't know.

620
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's not that technical.

621
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It just, that's a really good thing is it saves you like infinity dollars.

622
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah.

623
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And basically becomes a no costs.

624
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Well, that's, I'll have to look into that if I'm going to continue this as like a serious

625
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
venture because that was like, all my experimentation was about trying to cut the cost as low as possible

626
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
without cutting too much quality.

627
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It was like, cause I didn't want to use Gilden shirts cause we've used those for all of our

628
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
selling so far.

629
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And I think they're not that comfortable.

630
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I would much rather have higher quality shirts, but I didn't want to go too crazy cause I

631
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
didn't want it to be like a really expensive run.

632
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So I bought the Haynes shirts that are like the step up from the Gildens.

633
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So depending on who you ask, like I don't think May says she doesn't like it as much as the

634
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Gildens.

635
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So whatever, I guess there's a taste preference level.

636
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Nonetheless, I sprung for the Haynes, which was like $2 a shirt as opposed to like 190

637
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
a shirt, you know, it's not a huge difference in cost from the shipping end, though when

638
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
you're buying a bulk, you know, it does, it does make a difference, but it's like you

639
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
can, you have a higher quality shirt, more people are going to buy it, you know.

640
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Right.

641
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So I bought the Haynes shirts and tons of papers.

642
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I had to buy a lot of ink, but you know, I printed it all from home.

643
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So there's no additional fee on top of paying for the ink.

644
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The papers are not expensive at all.

645
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And you know, the shipping, that was the hardest thing to figure out because I thought I was

646
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
going to ship them all from like the post office.

647
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Well, no, I thought I was going to ship them all from FedEx because for my care packs that

648
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,500
I do every month, I was originally shipping those from the post office, but the post office

649
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:13,000
basically has like a flat rate for anything under like seven ounces or something like

650
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
that.

651
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Or maybe, maybe it's even more than that.

652
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's like anything under a certain number of ounces, it's all like 350 or whatever to

653
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
mail something.

654
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So I had initially been mailing through them and it would usually cost me like 70 bucks

655
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
to mail 40 care packs or whatever.

656
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And then I found out that at FedEx, the weight is directly proportional to the, what?

657
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
UPS.

658
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
What did you say?

659
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
UPS.

660
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
UPS?

661
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What did I say?

662
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
FedEx.

663
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
UPS, not FedEx.

664
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Sorry, that was a may correcting me from the sideline.

665
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Listen to my story.

666
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

667
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So yeah, not FedEx at all.

668
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,440
It was UPS that we went to instead of USPS and like, yeah, the weight scales by price.

669
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,800
So like, no matter how light your package is, it keeps getting cheaper for being lighter.

670
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,000
So because these were like one ounce packages, UPS would ship them for like a dollar.

671
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,440
So that immediately cut my cost into a third for shipping those.

672
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,920
So I was thinking, okay, well UPS is just better than USPS.

673
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,640
Not fully understanding their system yet.

674
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,760
So when I took the shirts there, I had done an initial round where I sold them for like,

675
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,120
I think, I think it was like $40 a piece.

676
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,320
Like I was really selling them for a lot initially for this test run that I did where

677
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,200
they were all printed differently.

678
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,040
Each one, like the printer had fucked up in a different way on every single shirt.

679
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:49,800
So either it had a weird ink running effect or it was like all blue or something like,

680
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,880
they looked cool and like people in my discord were like, oh, I like that it looks fucked

681
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,600
up and that they're like exclusive, you know, because each one looked so different.

682
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,880
And they were like neat and like glitchy and aesthetic.

683
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,640
So people were like, yeah, I'll buy those.

684
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,360
And this is like, you know, the most hardcore fans are offered first.

685
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,240
So it was just in my discord that I promoted it.

686
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,080
But I sold all 10 of my like initial or eight, I think of my initial round of shirts went

687
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:22,920
to UPS and they're like $10 a piece to ship because they were heavier, you know, and then

688
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,480
I found out that at USPS they would still be, they're still under seven ounces.

689
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,120
So there's still that flat 350 rate.

690
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,240
So I'm like, fuck, I got to do this at the post office instead of UPS.

691
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,000
So that was like the importance of the experiment.

692
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,080
So yeah, through USPS they'd be 350 to ship.

693
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,120
But what eventually happened is I go to USPS carrying 50 fucking shirts that I want to

694
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:52,160
ship and they all need postage and they're just like, uh, you know, we have like a machine

695
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
over there.

696
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,400
You can do it yourself because they have to like input all the information on every single

697
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,400
fucking package.

698
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,760
So it would take hours if they were going to do this.

699
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,520
So they told me to go over to this machine and the machine, if you have to enter the

700
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,280
information yourself, it takes like five minutes of package and it was charging more

701
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,260
than what that flat rate was for some reason.

702
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,360
So we were just like, fuck it, we'll do this at home and get a stamps.com account.

703
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,600
Tom, I think you have one, right?

704
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,840
Yeah.

705
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,160
So I had been resistant to getting it because it's like $19 a month and I thought I might

706
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,700
only do this once, you know, but like they do give you a free trial period and a bunch

707
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,160
of like free postage when you start.

708
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,560
But more importantly, they give you way cheaper rates than anything else.

709
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,960
It was only like a buck 15 to mail each of these fucking shirts, the postage that they

710
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
gave me.

711
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,760
And like granted, I don't know if all these shirts have gotten to everybody yet.

712
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,880
I've heard a couple of people say they got them, um, you know, I don't know if I'm going

713
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,440
to go to my PO box and find it flooded with returns because that would be terrible.

714
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,660
But uh, the postage that it printed for me was very cheap.

715
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:07,300
So I sold all these shirts for like 30 bucks a piece, 40 if you lived international.

716
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,980
Um, no, maybe it was 25, was it 25 that I was charging for the shirts?

717
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:19,340
It was either 25 or 30, but like you, it was an additional five if you were in Canada because

718
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,780
that's how much more of the postage seemed to cost, but it ended up being less than that.

719
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:30,100
And uh, you know, an extra 10 if you lived in, uh, uh, like a, you know, far away foreign

720
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,220
country, because I was used to paying like $10 shipping to go to there and it was cheaper

721
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,540
again through stamps.com.

722
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,820
So like I couldn't make my shirts even cheaper next time and sell even more of them now that

723
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,540
I know how cheap the postage is.

724
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:49,820
But like, uh, yeah, fucking, I made a shitload of money selling 50 shirts because they were

725
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,660
all handmade and I signed them each personally.

726
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,020
So it was like a very exclusive run.

727
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,440
It was like, this is the only time I'm printing this design.

728
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,800
You get, there's 50 of them for sale.

729
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,560
Um, here's the sizes I have available and, uh, they're all hand signed.

730
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,080
So you know, this is the only chance there will ever be to get this design signed by

731
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,580
Digi Bro.

732
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,440
And, um, you know, I mailed them to everybody personally and it went extremely well.

733
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,840
It funded my Otacon trip entirely.

734
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,960
I made like, so the total cost of production was probably like $500.

735
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,440
But the total I made was like $1,500.

736
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,240
So yeah, I made like over $1,000 profit.

737
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:42,360
I used it to pay for the hotel for Otacon and, uh, pay, uh, I pay May $400 a month to

738
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,700
be my assistant and that just went right to her paycheck.

739
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:52,440
So it was like, yeah, it was a huge fucking benefit for me, just like pocketing a thousand

740
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,920
grand as extra money for that month, you know, just, just here's a more money.

741
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:04,880
I have, and, uh, now I, now I still have $600 in the bank after going to Otacon, you know?

742
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,040
So yeah, it was fucking cool and, uh, I will definitely be selling more physical things

743
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
in the future.

744
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,200
But like what, you know how I've made almost as much money is just raffling shit during

745
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,680
live streams, um, really?

746
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,600
So we started doing a thing where, um, like initially we printed something on a hat, like

747
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,680
cause I accidentally, while I was scanning in May's drawings of Pokemon that she does

748
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,560
for the edited versions of our, uh, live streams cause we're doing like a Nuzlocke.

749
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:42,240
So you know, she, she draws all the Pokemon as like whatever stupid nickname they have

750
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,920
and, um, puts it on screen.

751
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,880
So I accidentally printed one of her drawings cause it was in the scanner.

752
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,160
And so we just put it on a hat cause we were like, fuck it, it'll be merged for the stream

753
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,520
and we'll raffle it.

754
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,640
So you know, if you give us at least a dollar in super chat, we put your name in a, in a

755
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,320
cup and one guy gets chosen at the end to win.

756
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,840
So it's basically like you can just donate a dollar and be in this raffle and you might

757
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,360
win something that's worth more than a dollar.

758
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,600
Some people will put in way more than a dollar trying to win it and not win it.

759
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,240
But you know, those people have a lot of money.

760
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,240
Yeah.

761
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,440
It's usually like butthole weave, just throwing fuckloads of money into our, uh, into our

762
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,520
super chats, but like in a couple of people who will just stop by and they don't really

763
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
care about the raffle.

764
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,680
They just give me a whole bunch of money cause they, they like me, you know, it's way easier

765
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,360
for people to just give donations to super chat, I think, because it's not, it's just

766
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,040
like a less complex system than Twitch.

767
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,080
And also I have more automatic audience streaming on YouTube because I'm on like my main channel

768
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,060
streaming, you know, um, so like, but yeah.

769
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:55,580
So initially we were just doing this hat, but then I raffled off one of my t-shirts,

770
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,780
um, and that did like a little bit better.

771
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:05,340
And then I had the utterly brilliant idea of I'm going to cut a page out of the Ari

772
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,700
Fureta light novel where there's like a sexy loli on it and write the word boob on it and

773
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,700
send it to whoever wins this raffle.

774
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:19,500
And we made like $300 or something in super chats, like raffling.

775
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Was it like that?

776
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,620
Yeah.

777
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
It was, it was a lot.

778
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,060
We made a lot of money in super chats, just raffling off a page of Ari Fureta.

779
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,060
It couldn't have been 300.

780
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,060
I need a loaded audience.

781
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,060
Like you have.

782
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,060
Jesus Christ.

783
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,580
Well, just cause it was like a, they thought it was a funny meme and, uh, you know, a couple

784
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,260
people were competing kind of to get it.

785
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,740
It couldn't have been 300, but I think we did make that on the last stream.

786
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,660
Cause then the, the one after that, not the, no, not the last one we did, but the one before

787
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:54,820
was, um, we had an Ekans cock and balls because May drew, like our Ekans was named something

788
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,580
like penis or some shit like that.

789
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:01,260
I don't know what the fuck is his actual name, big old penis, right?

790
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,740
In reference to the Aaron Hansen song.

791
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:10,620
So we have an Ekans that the chat has named big old penis and May draws it as like the

792
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,940
Ekans as the dick and two polka balls as the balls.

793
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,420
And I had accidentally printed that onto a piece of paper again.

794
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,300
So I was just like, all right, we'll get, we'll, we're raffling a t-shirt with Ekans

795
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,900
cock and balls on it.

796
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,540
And that was the one where I think where we made like $300 off of the raffle.

797
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,380
And then we probably made like, uh, probably over a hundred because we got a couple of

798
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,620
big super chats on the most recent one.

799
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,740
Um, so basically what I'm talking about right now is just that I have tons of alternate

800
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,180
revenue sources opening up and it's really great.

801
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,820
Um, it's a good shit.

802
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,580
And like, I think that a lot of us could capitalize on it because selling the t-shirts

803
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:57,940
yourself is not as big of a hassle as it seems on the surface and way more people

804
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,620
will do it.

805
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,980
Like we had already learned this lesson with the I am gains shirts because like when

806
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:08,100
we did our initial run where Tom was hand making them, we sold out of the 10 we had

807
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,700
in like fucking hours.

808
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:15,780
And then we could not even sell 10 shirts on like heavily promoted over like eight

809
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,700
months that we were selling through Redbubble and spreadsheet.

810
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,460
Like, yeah, I mean, even now they're still all up there.

811
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,860
Like they're integrated with the T spring and nobody buys them.

812
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,700
I look at the numbers.

813
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,220
No, they don't sell it all because people don't want to buy shit from those websites.

814
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,020
They just don't, like it's too expensive for a shitty shirt.

815
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,380
You know, and it's like, if you can print it yourself, it adds value there.

816
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,900
And even then you could just get higher quality material if you really wanted to

817
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,500
like be serious about selling shirts all the time, you know, like get higher

818
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,300
quality shirts that people really want to buy.

819
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,940
Like Dick Masterson sells a lot of fucking shirts because his shirts are

820
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,620
high quality and they look great on you.

821
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,580
So like I will buy multiple Dick Show shirts because he goes through and he

822
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,340
sells them for only like 22 bucks.

823
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:04,740
So it's not like he's, you know, raking you to get profit.

824
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,460
He just sells it for a lower profit margin and sells way the fuck more shirts,

825
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,060
you know?

826
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,220
So like I think that that's something you can do when you either work directly

827
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,620
with like a specified, you know, shirt sales people like he does.

828
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,900
Like he doesn't work through just spread shirt or something.

829
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,300
He's working through people who are better and, uh, and like, but if you just

830
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,020
make him yourself again, there's an added value even in that just because you

831
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,500
handmade it and like people just want to receive something from you.

832
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,860
It's way cooler.

833
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:41,660
It's just like way, like the thought of, oh, my favorite creator threw an

834
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:46,100
image into this website and it has generated a shirt that I'm going to buy.

835
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:51,300
It's very different from my favorite creator put this shirt under a heat press,

836
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,500
put his face on it and then mailed it to me, you know, right?

837
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,740
It's way more personal, way more interesting story.

838
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,060
It's interesting that you're bringing up this topic because like I'm gearing up

839
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,780
to, uh, start kind of dipping back into this myself.

840
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,500
Cause I have a tier on my Patreon where it's like a quarterly care package.

841
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,980
So cause I'm, I'm going to, the idea for the tier, I have a couple of people

842
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,980
on it already is that, uh, every three months I'll put together like a bunch

843
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,180
of exclusive merch that'll only be through this tier and ship it to you.

844
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,420
So like it'll be t-shirts and like, I had, that's, that's an idea I had too,

845
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,900
but I would have to be like, if you want to do that kind of thing, you're

846
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,380
at an advantage cause you have like a button maker and shit.

847
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,460
And people do like the buttons and stuff too.

848
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,940
Um, and I could get one of those, but it does eventually be like juggling

849
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,780
a lot of balls.

850
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,180
Like if you're mailing out a lot of that shit, you gotta do a lot of

851
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,260
fucking work each month to, you know, make sure you have all the pieces together.

852
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,740
My idea for getting around this is that like, first of all, the tier is quarterly.

853
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,540
So it's only done four times a year, even though it's a monthly pledge.

854
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,800
Like it gives, it gives me time to like, I'll have three months to put all

855
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,640
the pages together.

856
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,400
So do you have to be a page in for all three of those months to get it?

857
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,440
Yeah, it would be, you know, I would just check the numbers and make sure

858
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,120
of all that shit.

859
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,560
Um, I wouldn't have that seems like it could be cheesable.

860
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,240
So I'd be careful.

861
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,360
It's definitely could be cheesable, but like, I'm, I'm small enough now

862
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,080
that I can easily keep track of like three people and make sure

863
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,120
nobody's like causing any bullshit.

864
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,240
But another thing I was thinking of doing for limited runs, I just real quick,

865
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:28,200
I found out that people can cheese my rants because somebody like just

866
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,040
changed his name and posted another, cause I did it as like a thread of

867
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,880
comments, like on a, I say, like post your rant topics here and then people

868
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,280
just comment on that post cause that's the easiest way to keep it all on one

869
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,040
place and make sure I don't miss anything.

870
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,760
But they were like, yeah, you can change your name and comment again.

871
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,440
And it doesn't, you know, indicate that it's a different person or the same

872
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,200
person rather.

873
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,440
Um, so, uh, you know, they use that to get two rants and they were like,

874
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,960
you should close this loophole on Patreon, really?

875
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah, they changed their name and posted in that chat again.

876
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,600
And I just didn't know it was a different person.

877
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,800
So, or didn't know it was the same person rather.

878
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,720
And, uh, did a second read and they were like, they did it just to like,

879
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,600
kind of like, see if that loophole was exploitable and then let me know.

880
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,200
But like, it definitely happened.

881
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,120
And like, so now I'm like, well, I guess I'm going to have people PM me so

882
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,360
that I can, you know, it'll always show me that you PM me before, like, uh, you

883
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,360
know, it won't be any mistaking, but that just means a way more to keep track

884
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,280
of, you know, I have to go into every single PM as opposed to just one thread.

885
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,200
So yeah, that's just like the, the kinds of things you have to account for

886
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,200
when you get to a size where people can cheese your thing, you know.

887
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,440
Yeah.

888
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,320
I mean, the thing I was, cause I was, I want to start doing limited run shirts

889
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,400
again, and that's the whole thing.

890
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,800
I'd have them be limited run.

891
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,560
Like, I mean, like you're doing, like I'd only probably want to have like 20 to

892
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,640
50 had a time and I was thinking of doing pre-orders, right?

893
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,480
So instead of like making 50 shirts and hoping they sell, like I just a month

894
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,240
before, but like if you want to buy this design and then make exactly how many

895
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,760
are ordered, cause if you have the like pre-order money, you can use that to buy

896
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,240
all those shirts and shit, or at least to guarantee like, even if you're not

897
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,280
charging before you, you know, buy it, just to guarantee that you will have that

898
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,880
money afterwards, you know, um, cause that was the scariest part is like, do I

899
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,720
want to drop $150 on 50 shirts and maybe I only sell three of them, you know,

900
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,080
like that would suck.

901
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,320
Cause then you definitely didn't make back the money, you know, unless you were

902
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,560
charging a lot for the shirts.

903
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,360
Um, but the fact that I sold out was like, I mean, I had like two left that I

904
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:46,800
gave away at Otacon to the two people I hung out with there, but, um, cause they

905
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,920
had respectively given me weed and given me free art.

906
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,280
So I gave them free shirts.

907
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:00,560
Um, but otherwise I sold through all the shirts and, um, like what I'm planning

908
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,600
to do is not to just sell more shirts, but to try to sell different types of

909
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,040
things in like a cycle.

910
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Cause like Anthony Fantano will like maybe once a year, um, maybe once or twice a

911
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,400
year, release new shirts on a store that are all limited run.

912
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,040
It's always a new design that he commissioned from somebody and, um, you

913
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,320
know, he, he sells like a hundred shirts of it or something like that.

914
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,880
I have one of those from like a few years back because I like that kind of

915
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,200
shit.

916
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,240
I will buy these.

917
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,080
This is why I think it's interesting, you know, to do these experiments is

918
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,280
like I, I'm selling the kind of thing I would buy, but, um, I personally

919
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,320
though would usually buy higher quality shirts than the ones that I'm selling.

920
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,840
Um, you know, like I would, I, that's why I want to sell better shirts.

921
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,560
Cause I know I would buy only buy it if it was like, if I knew it was going to

922
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,560
be kind of good, um, to wear cause I have a lot of good shirts.

923
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,880
So, um, God, that, that was a fucking rabbit hole of me geeking out about

924
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,600
fucking shirts.

925
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,200
It's exciting.

926
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,720
I mean, there's, there's something really, I don't know, maybe it's because

927
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,600
like I'm just a fucking doomer piece of shit at this point, but like the idea

928
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,560
of making physical goods still intrigues me because like when I was a little kid,

929
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,640
that just seems so far beyond what a normal person could do.

930
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,160
Right.

931
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,920
And also it's like, I grew up collecting shit.

932
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,400
Like I'm, I have a huge collection.

933
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,400
You all know this, you know, and like, I like having weird exclusive

934
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,600
shit that like tells you something about me and where I was.

935
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:37,320
Like I have that minds got rocks in it art book where it was like all the really

936
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:42,920
like fancy, my little pony, um, like creators, like artists, like all the

937
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,160
ones who had like weirder styles did an art book together and like they probably

938
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,320
only made, you know, a couple hundred of them and they sold them on Tumblr

939
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,920
or whatever and at Otacon or Brony con rather.

940
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,240
But like I have one, there's not a lot of them.

941
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,120
I have it because I like, I wanted to say, oh, this is like what represents

942
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,840
me in this community is like this cool wispy art that's different.

943
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,800
And, um, you know, I never even looked at it.

944
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,760
I literally have not looked at the book at all.

945
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,760
I bought it just to have it and did not even look at it, which is how it's,

946
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,440
it's true for a lot of the art books I have.

947
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,320
I don't know why.

948
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,880
I just like to own a book that represents my aesthetics, but not necessarily

949
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,720
to actually look through it regularly.

950
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:34,920
But, uh, yeah, uh, the, so for me, like I want to sell all kinds of physical products.

951
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,720
Like if I, I feel like if I was selling a shirt every month, like a different shirt,

952
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,920
you know, very quickly, people are going to be like, I already bought a shirt from

953
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,480
you. I don't need, I don't need fucking six shirts from you.

954
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,120
You know, like I'll do a couple.

955
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:55,840
So I'm only going to run shirts probably once, like every, maybe four or five

956
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,880
months or six months or something, you know, long enough that, and, and make a

957
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,040
very different designs.

958
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,840
Like I have an idea for my next design, which I want to be like a white on black

959
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,880
of like just my like sunglasses, like, like, or just a part of my face that has

960
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,200
my sunglasses and under that, it'll say void gazer and like a scratchy hand

961
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,120
writing style.

962
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,080
And I think that would be really cool.

963
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:20,680
Sounds dope.

964
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,240
But I would have to be able to do white on black shirts.

965
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:30,200
And so that's like a whole other thing to learn, you know, um, but like what

966
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,640
you'd probably want to do for that.

967
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,200
And like, unfortunately, the big problem with white on black is that you need

968
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:43,360
to be able to ideally print white ink, printers don't do that unless you get

969
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,760
a special printer and those cost infinity trillion dollars.

970
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:52,080
So the way to get around that is there's paper that's designed to be white.

971
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,480
Um, yeah.

972
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,440
And you just cut the image out and then heat press it, but it gives it's that's

973
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,720
the kind of material that gives you the kind of plasticky feel on a shirt.

974
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,160
Right.

975
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,560
That makes really no way around that at our budget level.

976
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,880
So like you can either cut it with scissors, which sucks, or you can get a

977
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,960
cry cut machine and you basically load the image file into this cry cut machine.

978
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,600
And then it will cut on the paper.

979
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,680
Exactly that design that you have based on the alpha channel of the image.

980
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,560
How expensive is that thing?

981
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,240
Uh, not too expensive.

982
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,680
Probably around the same price as the, uh, the heat press itself is probably

983
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,320
around a hundred, $150, $200, depending on the model you get.

984
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,040
Matt got one, uh, DB pony.

985
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,360
He bought one because he was making custom stickers.

986
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,160
And so by using the cry cut machine, it would cut them exactly to the right size.

987
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,040
This sounds like a fucking hacker ass machine.

988
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,320
I didn't know fucking technology like this existed.

989
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah, it's like not, it's not like a super new age thing.

990
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,360
It's been around for a while.

991
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,760
It just, it uses the alpha channel of a PNG to like crop the image to, uh, it

992
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,120
just cuts it based on the, the transparency.

993
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,560
And so you can get it cropped exactly to how it should be.

994
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,320
That's really fucking cool.

995
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,800
Um, yeah.

996
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,400
It's a solution to everything.

997
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,280
If you Google enough longterm, I'll probably get that.

998
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,680
If I keep making shirts, like this run went so well that it made me want to do

999
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:17,280
more like it and like, um, I don't know how frequently I can, you know, like

1000
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,320
interest the same people or if the same, if it would only be the same people who

1001
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,600
are interested in shirts every time, you know, um, but that's why I want to

1002
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,480
mix up the product.

1003
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,400
So like, I think I might sell some kind of magazine, like some kind of

1004
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,040
self-published magazine, um, as one of my next ones.

1005
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,440
Cause people have told me that they want like print copies of some of the stuff

1006
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,440
I've written, um, particularly the, uh, I wrote this light novel in like a day.

1007
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:42,800
It sucks.

1008
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,440
And I hate it.

1009
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,240
Um, like people have said they want a print copy of that.

1010
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,400
And I thought about doing that, but like, it seems like it would be a lot of

1011
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,440
effort for me to do without going through like Lulu or something.

1012
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,920
Um, cause it's, it's, you know, it's like the, it's like a couple hundred pages

1013
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,640
probably in a lot of it is nonsense.

1014
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,920
And I'm not that proud of it.

1015
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,880
Like I think it functions better as an audio file that you can skip around in,

1016
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,760
you know, then as like a physical book to read.

1017
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,560
And I would rather print a book.

1018
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,720
I was just like, had worked harder on like one that I didn't literally

1019
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,000
write in a day, you know?

1020
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,480
Um, and then I had written this, this sort of mini book last year, uh, it was,

1021
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,040
well, I consider it a pamphlet.

1022
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:29,320
It was 40 pages that was called, um, fixed that for you, which was basically

1023
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:34,960
my like, I don't know, like my, my manifesto, like my, my like, you know,

1024
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,240
here's what the world should be like book, you know?

1025
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:44,160
Um, and, uh, that was like the one that's that, like, I was planning to print

1026
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,280
and I was definitely going to sell them and ship them out.

1027
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,480
And I was also going to make a video book out of it, but, um, enough time

1028
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,040
passed, but with the me not having edited the rest of the book.

1029
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,600
And now when I read it, I'm like, this is fucking weird.

1030
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,880
Like this, this reads like somebody who, um, has just become a complete

1031
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,240
bad scientist trying to explain to you why, um, like why everything in society

1032
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,720
is fucked up, but like it was way too dense.

1033
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,680
It's hard to read.

1034
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,960
It's like hard to parse.

1035
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,080
So like when my own writing is hard for me to parse, I'm like, maybe

1036
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,240
this is not something I want to publish, um, that strongly, but I think

1037
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,080
for, I suppose.

1038
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:31,600
Yeah, but like I, I have been working on other like fiction novels that I

1039
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,920
would love to publish.

1040
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,640
Like I've been working on a proper light novel.

1041
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,040
And so like I'm only like maybe a fourth of the way in or maybe even half.

1042
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,760
I might just make it really short, but like I'm considering finishing that

1043
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,480
and selling that as a physical book.

1044
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,800
But like, I also just thought the other day, like, well, I've always wanted

1045
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,840
to make a magazine.

1046
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,480
I have the technology at my disposal.

1047
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
Like, you know, I know how to print this shit.

1048
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,040
All I have to do is staple them together.

1049
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,720
Um, I know how to use the, the, the programs that, that let you design

1050
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:09,040
magazines, like basically Adobe InDesign, um, which I love because I took a

1051
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,600
class on it, you know, I know how to use this fucking shit.

1052
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,880
So I should just make a fucking magazine because I've always wanted to do it.

1053
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,640
Like I've been dreaming of it since I was a kid.

1054
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,200
Um, I mean, I've made magazines before.

1055
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:25,320
Like I've made with them out of pen and paper, you know, but like this

1056
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,000
could be a real one that I could actually sell.

1057
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,920
And that would make, that would be like the biggest come for me in the world.

1058
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:36,720
Like if I managed to sell like 50 of some, you know, limited run magazine,

1059
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,240
and then people were to like deconstruct it and scan it onto the internet.

1060
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,760
That would be the coolest fucking thing that's ever happened, you know, in my life.

1061
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,440
That would be like the height of what my aesthetic is.

1062
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,760
Like I really love magazines.

1063
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,120
I love the format of them.

1064
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,800
I've always loved the idea of just a whole magazine written by one person.

1065
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,760
Like basically just a dojinji, you know, but like one that is stylized

1066
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,720
like a magazine.

1067
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:06,480
And, um, yeah, I think that would be the most Digi bro thing I could possibly

1068
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,640
sell and like seeing that 50 people bought my shirt.

1069
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,400
I'm absolutely certain 50 people at least would buy my magazine.

1070
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,640
I might even try to sell more of it, but like it depends on how much it costs

1071
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,080
to print it and how much I'm charging for it, you know, you could do that really cheap.

1072
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,720
I mean, if you went like, if you wanted to go to like the kind of more grunge

1073
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,880
indie zine kind of aesthetic and do it like black and white and really like

1074
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,280
lean into the whole zine aesthetic, you could do that super cheap.

1075
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,160
It wouldn't cost a lot.

1076
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,560
I'm more into the idea of it being like a high production look, like looking

1077
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,600
like a proper anime magazine, you know, like, I mean, I wouldn't have to like

1078
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,560
print it on like super expensive paper.

1079
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,200
I don't think, but like I would go all out with the design of it, although

1080
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,720
like my design sense is also very fucking bare bones.

1081
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,760
So like it's definitely not, I don't have the skills to make it look like

1082
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,720
an actual anime magazine, you know, but like the format of it will be like one.

1083
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,800
It'll just be like a weird, like visually off.

1084
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,440
It'll definitely have the zine feel just because that's my visual style.

1085
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,760
Like, um, you know, like there's no helping it.

1086
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:17,560
I, I cannot be professional enough to not have some level of like, okay,

1087
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,400
this is clearly made by a guy, you know, not a team, not a graphic artist,

1088
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,480
not somebody who, you know, not somebody who studied graphic arts as much as

1089
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,920
just typography and in design, you know.

1090
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,200
It'll still be cool.

1091
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:34,920
I mean, I don't know.

1092
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,280
I'm definitely with you on that romantic, romanticization.

1093
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,240
That's not the way to say that word, but you know what I mean?

1094
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,760
Of physical media, well, and it's just, it's worth a lot more money to people,

1095
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,680
which is like another part of the great thing.

1096
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,960
Like making $1,500 in one go is a lot of fucking money.

1097
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:57,600
And that's like just because people want to own something that they can like have,

1098
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,400
you know, and it has more literal value than like data on the internet.

1099
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,720
And you and I are both huge advocates of like, like you still buy all your

1100
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,160
games physically, you don't even buy any digital games.

1101
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,840
So like you understand how much you value, like having physical property

1102
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,600
that has resale value and like, you know, potentially even growth value.

1103
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,800
If we, if we continue to become more popular and like maybe people want

1104
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,600
to collect our old shirts and shit and like you can resell the shit on eBay

1105
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,360
one day for more, who knows, you know, or at least enough to recoup some of your loss,

1106
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,320
you know, like even if you can only sell my shirt for like five bucks on eBay,

1107
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,880
at least you could make five bucks on it when you don't care about it anymore.

1108
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,040
You know, right?

1109
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,320
I don't know.

1110
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,640
It's just like you're giving away money.

1111
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,960
I want to have something tangible in return for it as opposed to like permission

1112
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,600
to access something on your storefront that could be turned off tomorrow.

1113
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
Exactly.

1114
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,840
Guess I'm just a fucking boomer that way.

1115
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,720
And that's I think that might be how it feels for like people to use

1116
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,880
something like spread shirt.

1117
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,480
It's like, you know, we had designs taken off of it.

1118
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,680
We kept trying to put our fucking JoJo meme shirt on there.

1119
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,640
And like if we had just made and sold the JoJo meme shirt,

1120
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,440
we definitely would have sold a couple, you know, I guess we could still technically do that.

1121
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,120
I mean, I'm still salty.

1122
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,960
I still think about it every couple days.

1123
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,440
I'm like, I have no hands and I must fap.

1124
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,880
Why did I not make that shirt?

1125
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,040
It was perfect.

1126
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,440
Yeah.

1127
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,360
I think that shirt would still sell because JoJo is still popular.

1128
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,800
And like, you know, all we got to do is mention it at the end of a video on my channel.

1129
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,720
I'll just be like, Hey, here's the JoJo meme shirt.

1130
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,520
Tom is selling this, you know, it says JoJo meme on it.

1131
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,840
But I demand a cut if I do that because I came up with the shirt.

1132
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,960
That's fine. It seems that seems reasonable.

1133
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,160
Get into the joint merch venture.

1134
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,400
Alicorn Princess all over again.

1135
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,520
Oh, Alicorn Princess is the failure that taught me everything, though.

1136
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,040
Yeah.

1137
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,000
Cut our teeth the hard way on that one.

1138
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,200
Can you can you tell me what's the Salicorn Princess thing?

1139
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,440
It was the t-shirt I made back in like 2013.

1140
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,400
When me and Tom were first like really starting to get like big on YouTube,

1141
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,520
we were talking a lot about how to monetize it because like I had

1142
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,640
initially I've been making a lot of just before you even get to deep into it.

1143
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,680
The reason we were talking about this because this is before Patreon.

1144
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
So this Patreon did not exist yet.

1145
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,080
Patreon didn't exist.

1146
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,400
And initially I would be making like $600 a month on ad revenue

1147
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,360
for like two months before the big thing happened where like every pony

1148
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,080
video got demonetized or blocked.

1149
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,480
And I had to completely change my style so that I could even post on YouTube,

1150
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,120
which is why I started using the pony avatar and all that shit

1151
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,320
was just to get past copyright, which is the biggest reason we all did it,

1152
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,240
you know, because if you posted full screen footage, your shit got blocked.

1153
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,280
So like in that time where I wasn't making any money,

1154
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,520
I had like already left my job and I was like basically had enough

1155
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,560
saved to stay afloat for a little while.

1156
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,960
But me and Tom were like, we have to find a way to make money off of this.

1157
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,360
If we want this to be what we do, you know.

1158
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,920
So we were talking about building our own like email subscription service

1159
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,000
where people would pay just to watch our videos in the first place.

1160
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,920
But then it was like, how do we market the videos?

1161
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,600
We were trying to do a kit.

1162
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,400
We planned a Kickstarter that was going to be to just fund like us doing the videos for a while.

1163
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,560
And then if like we had like a crazy stretch goal that we would move in together

1164
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,800
and make videos every day if we hit 40 grand.

1165
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:57,040
Um, not realistic, but you know, just a dream naive, but, uh,

1166
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,600
eventually while we, we also talked about doing shirts cause Tom had a shirt press.

1167
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,240
So I commissioned him to do a design of the moment where I say,

1168
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,960
I'm a fucking Alicorn princess cause it was like my most famous catchphrase

1169
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,640
in my most popular video.

1170
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:18,880
And, um, Tom drew a picture that was like my pony as like that moment

1171
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,200
when Twilight first grows her wings and it says, I'm a fucking Alicorn princess.

1172
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,560
There was both an uncensored and censored version, but, um,

1173
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,080
I learned a lot of important lessons from that. First of all,

1174
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:37,280
hiring Tom to do the design meant that it was in his style and there was not a t

1175
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,160
shirt of my pony in the style that it naturally appears.

1176
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,000
So like I don't think that people were going to gravitate to it as much because of

1177
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,840
the fact that it's not like the way they know the character, you know,

1178
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,800
um, but I was like nervous about using that character because I had not paid the

1179
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,080
artist who designed it. You know, she just did it as a fan and I didn't want to

1180
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,120
like capitalize off of it without them getting a cut and she seemed resistant to

1181
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,760
receiving money for whatever reason. Um,

1182
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:09,720
so I hired Tom to make a design and also the shirt says fuck on it and most

1183
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,120
people don't want to wear that computational of a shirt, including me.

1184
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,800
I have several shirts to say fuck on them that I'm like really nervous to wear in

1185
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,760
public. And I like always feel really embarrassed when I realized that I'm

1186
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,320
wearing it in public and have not noticed. Like I have the, I have the fuck off.

1187
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:32,160
I'm autistic shirt. And also the, um, you know, the, uh, the, uh,

1188
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,480
world as a fuck born to die world as a fuck shirt,

1189
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,400
that meme from Tumblr, the like 200 billion dead cops or whatever,

1190
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,360
except I have the devil man version. Um,

1191
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,160
so it's the two characters from devil man,

1192
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,880
but it still says born to die world as a fuck on it.

1193
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,800
So I feel a little weird wearing it in public.

1194
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,120
I feel it. Like there's this song, uh, from Carol on Tuesday,

1195
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,960
like the, the galactic mermaids,

1196
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,880
I want to desperately make it my ringtone because,

1197
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,920
because they're saying fucking bullshit.

1198
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,800
It's like, and it's such a good song. It sounds so good.

1199
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,520
And I resonate with the lyrics,

1200
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,960
but I'm too shy to put it as my ringtone,

1201
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,240
but because what if I get a call in public?

1202
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,240
I don't get calls, but what if I get a call in public?

1203
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,920
Just, just got to be a badass about it. It's funny.

1204
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,560
I did, I made a similar mistake because I've been like in,

1205
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,680
I've been bedridden for like months now,

1206
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,120
but I went out and got like snacks a couple of days ago,

1207
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,040
not realizing what shirt I was wearing.

1208
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,600
I was wearing a game of throne shirt, like a meme shirt.

1209
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:36,600
That was just, uh, uh, the hound and Aria,

1210
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,320
like sitting on the horse when, when, uh,

1211
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,600
like from one of the later seasons where he's just like, fuck the king.

1212
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,040
And it says, fuck in huge giant letters.

1213
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,560
And then under it, the king and this huge image.

1214
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,280
And I was just walking around all day in this shirt, like in public,

1215
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,640
not realizing that like I had this emblazoned on my chest. Yeah.

1216
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,080
It was, it was a power move without realizing it.

1217
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,120
So I'm a fucking Alicorn princess.

1218
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,240
Even the censored version, you can still say it's tell it says fuck.

1219
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,080
So not a lot of people going to buy a shirt that says fuck on it.

1220
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,720
And I think that like we pretty much only sold

1221
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,040
like the on the censored version to anybody other than I think Victor.

1222
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,160
So who did buy one?

1223
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,960
Because he thought it was fucking hilarious because it says fuck on it.

1224
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,920
And it's got a pony, you know, and it's my pony.

1225
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,760
So this is obvious why Victor would want this shirt.

1226
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,760
Not so obvious why anybody else would want it, you know?

1227
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,200
Because like, even though it was a memorable moment for one of my videos,

1228
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,120
it wasn't like a repeated catchphrase.

1229
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,680
It wasn't like it doesn't mean anything to the guy wearing it.

1230
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,080
Like I kind of thought maybe you could wear it and be like,

1231
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,200
yeah, I'm a fucking Alicorn princess.

1232
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,880
But like it just seems to be in reference to me, you know?

1233
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,640
Well, yeah, I guess it because it is you on the shirt itself,

1234
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,880
which is kind of undercuts that ability. Exactly.

1235
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,120
So like that's why like my like when I do the void gazer shirt,

1236
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,160
like I don't want it to be too like I want you to be able to tell.

1237
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,480
It's my like sunglasses look, but like, you know,

1238
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,400
it's not like just a picture of me and that's implying that that's who this is.

1239
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,520
You know, it's like anybody could be the void gazer, you know,

1240
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,800
just got to wear the sunglasses, basically.

1241
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,680
But yeah, like just I think if you're going to,

1242
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,800
if I'm going to make a shirt like out of myself,

1243
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,520
it has to be a better meme.

1244
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,480
And so like that was why it for years,

1245
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,960
I've considered trying to like hire Munchie to do his shirt.

1246
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,800
And like we were talking about it like a year and a half ago,

1247
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,440
where I had a few ideas.

1248
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,280
I was going to have him make me a human content machine shirt,

1249
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,400
which just says that in and like one that was like anime.

1250
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,480
It's a Japanese colloquialism.

1251
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,560
And he gave me a few designs that I kind of liked,

1252
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,840
but weren't really what I had in mind.

1253
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,960
And like I felt like getting exactly the visuals I wanted was not going to be

1254
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,040
possible communicating with somebody else.

1255
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,000
Like like I have a really specific vision in mind for what I would want for my shirts.

1256
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,400
So it's like I can't just commission an artist.

1257
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,480
It's going to feel like their art.

1258
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,560
It's not going to feel like Digi Bro's art.

1259
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,880
It's just going to be art of Digi Bro, you know?

1260
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:20,160
So like with the me versus the Kirito's one, it was like, OK,

1261
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,600
this is a piece of art I can create that like is within my wheelhouse

1262
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,680
that is totally going to be something only I would do, you know?

1263
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,600
Is it's it's like a it's a screen cap of me from one of my videos.

1264
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,640
You know, about to shoot a array of Kirito's.

1265
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,000
It's I had to like seek out, you know, pictures of each of the characters

1266
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,320
from behind to use in this image, which was not necessarily

1267
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,600
was neither as hard nor as easy as, you know,

1268
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,320
whatever you're thinking, it would be it's it's the opposite.

1269
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,200
And it yeah, like the the layout is from Fantasy Star Four

1270
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,320
because I'm a huge fantasy star fan.

1271
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,880
So like, you know, I even used I tracked down the specific

1272
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,720
font that's used in Fantasy Star to write in all the all the names and shit.

1273
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,720
So like, you know, even if all of this is not really like an

1274
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,160
it's not an artwork in the sense that like I drew it,

1275
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,840
but I compiled all these elements from around the web.

1276
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:26,960
And it's basically like a a a collage of different PNGs,

1277
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,200
you know, but into something that is that looks cool.

1278
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,840
So that's a very Digi Bro design.

1279
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,960
That's what I wanted to sell, you know.

1280
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,320
It's pretty sick.

1281
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,520
I've gone on about these shirts for way too long.

1282
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,360
It's just basically the shirts, the podcast episode, dude.

1283
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,760
This is this is the real shit.

1284
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,360
This is how this is how we're going to we're going to make money

1285
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,760
in the post YouTube apocalypse that is slowly marching its way toward us.

1286
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,600
And evidently, well, it's really funny, Tom,

1287
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,640
that like I'm really interested in going into all this depth with you

1288
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,080
because everybody on the PCP is like interested in alternative revenue

1289
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,320
sources, just having cool merch and stuff.

1290
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,920
But it's like we all have a tendency to like dabble our toes

1291
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,640
into something and take forever to really get into it and figure out

1292
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,320
what the fuck is going on, you know, like when it comes to doing merch

1293
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,240
or like streaming, like we spent a lot of time like, OK,

1294
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,440
we'll we'll we'll work on it while we're doing the stream.

1295
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,320
But we do not think about it again afterwards.

1296
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,200
And like there's a lot to learn, you know, to like optimize how we're doing it

1297
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,480
to, you know, create, like, especially when we were on Twitch

1298
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,720
and we didn't know anything about the culture of Twitch, you know.

1299
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,600
And like we did not learn anything about the culture of Twitch

1300
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,360
because we didn't take the time to do that because it's like a side venture.

1301
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,200
But like the PCP, when we talk about like merch, it's the same story.

1302
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,040
It's like everybody likes the idea of having merch.

1303
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,240
We have ideas for what merch we want.

1304
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,640
But like when it comes to the action of how do we get that merch made?

1305
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,040
Let's just go through spreadsheets so nobody has to think about it, you know.

1306
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:13,560
But like if somebody was dedicated to making all the merch and like,

1307
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,280
you know, obviously, that person would get more of the money

1308
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,320
and they are more incentivized to just make their own merch for themselves.

1309
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,800
But everybody should do that.

1310
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,960
Like, yeah, get into it.

1311
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,120
It's a good, it's fun, it's beneficial.

1312
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,720
Like if you're into merch and like the idea of people having merch of your shit

1313
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,920
by the materials, they will pay themselves off if you market it well, you know.

1314
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,600
Yeah, because we fucking sold again.

1315
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,520
We sold those 10 shirts in like no time, like off of a tweet.

1316
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,360
Literally, we just tweeted that we were selling the channel.

1317
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,280
It didn't exist. The stream didn't exist.

1318
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:52,160
It was just there's a name and that did better than when we actually had

1319
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,960
a channel and stream and we're actively advertising it in every single video.

1320
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,480
We were wearing the shirts on the stream.

1321
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,080
Like we were pushing the fuck out of these shirts and nobody was buying them

1322
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,600
after that initial 10.

1323
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,800
It's so much different if you make it yourself.

1324
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,560
Yeah. God damn it.

1325
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,120
I've really got to fucking make it hard.

1326
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,960
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1327
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,080
All right, go go relieve thyself.

1328
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,800
Mage. Yes, I am still present.

1329
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,720
Fucking dead this entire time.

1330
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:30,480
You're not you're not riveted by by the the in depth intricate

1331
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,400
backyard or insider baseball on fucking shirts.

1332
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,000
I don't sell any merch.

1333
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,880
Well, that's your problem right there.

1334
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,640
You got to you got to start whoring yourself out.

1335
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,600
You got to make that's how you make the big bucks.

1336
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,000
But I don't want to.

1337
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,520
God damn it, Mage.

1338
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,440
What is it? You fucking not.

1339
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,520
You don't want all the money.

1340
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,240
You don't want to fucking milk all these peasants for all their worth.

1341
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,880
I don't.

1342
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,560
I mean, I'd like to sell things, but like, I don't know,

1343
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,880
selling shirts, selling medicines and stuff like that.

1344
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,920
It seems complicated.

1345
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,320
And I don't want to do it.

1346
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,280
Mage, am I going to call you?

1347
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,680
Are you drawing?

1348
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,080
Have you been drawing this whole time?

1349
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,000
No. Are you sure?

1350
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,600
I'm positive.

1351
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,680
I drew a little bit in the middle.

1352
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,400
OK, because you because we before we started recording,

1353
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,840
I was like, hey, Mage, what's up?

1354
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,800
You're like, I'm drawing. I'm like, oh, yeah,

1355
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,640
I just wanted to finish up some line art quickly while you were.

1356
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,920
I didn't think this would go on.

1357
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,120
But like, well, you should be fair line art for in like five minutes.

1358
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,320
I didn't think it was going to go on that long either.

1359
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,880
And I did just sitting.

1360
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,800
I just been sitting here.

1361
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,280
I've been listening.

1362
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,480
I just have nothing to say.

1363
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,680
That's all right.

1364
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,240
What have you been doing?

1365
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,640
What's going on in Mage Land?

1366
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,400
You're back. You're back in the UK.

1367
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,520
What are you working on?

1368
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
What's what's going on?

1369
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,280
What's happening?

1370
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,640
A secret thing I might have mentioned a few

1371
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,760
times ago that I cannot tell much about anything

1372
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,720
because I can't.

1373
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,880
I cannot like a collaborative thing or sort of.

1374
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,520
Yes, me and a friend working on a thing.

1375
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,800
And that's all I can say.

1376
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,840
It's been it's been it's been going going sort of rough.

1377
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,280
Like, of course, I'm I'm the one drawing the things

1378
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,840
that I had to redraw everything I drew so far.

1379
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,000
So I'm sort of starting from scratch.

1380
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,280
Yeah, but it's OK.

1381
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,040
I'm a lot more happier with how things are coming out now right now.

1382
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,440
Can you tell me the the medium?

1383
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:28,000
Is it a comic book or an animation or I know I cannot tell you.

1384
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,040
It's not an animation.

1385
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,800
I can tell you that much.

1386
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,880
So it's not it's not that.

1387
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,880
So don't look forward to that.

1388
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,920
It's not going to be on my YouTube channel, probably.

1389
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,000
So it's not a video format.

1390
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,040
It's just some drawings for things.

1391
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,040
So, yeah, I've been completely restarting from scratch,

1392
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,600
but I'm happy with it because, like, I don't know.

1393
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,600
I just leveled up, I guess, since the last time I drew it.

1394
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,720
And it just looks so much better now.

1395
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,920
So I'm happy with that.

1396
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,680
And I've been playing a bit of Warframe if you heard of Warframe.

1397
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,080
I have played a bit of Warframe myself in my day.

1398
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,680
It's so fun. It's pretty cool.

1399
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,360
It's fun. I dig it.

1400
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,920
I haven't. It's not like one of those games I can get super into.

1401
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,160
Just again, I'm not a big multiplayer guy.

1402
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,880
But yeah, yeah, you did being being a spaceman.

1403
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,320
Just fun slicing things up.

1404
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,160
It's pretty cool.

1405
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,760
Yeah, I got since I have discord nitro.

1406
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,440
I got a Warframe for free sort of because discord

1407
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,160
did a thing with Warframe.

1408
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,480
And that's how they got me in.

1409
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,440
They were like, hey, I mean, Warframe is always free.

1410
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,640
Yeah, yeah, like free stuff.

1411
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,880
Give you like a bunch of goodies in the game

1412
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,000
because that's how they make all their money

1413
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,000
as they sell you stuff.

1414
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,920
But like discord is like, we'll give you the first hit for free

1415
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,640
because that's how we roll.

1416
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,800
Yeah, they were like, well, because you have discord nitro,

1417
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,800
we're going to have like give you like $50 worth of goodies for free

1418
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,680
in this game. And I'm like, I like free stuff.

1419
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,960
So I download the game and I played the game just because I got the free stuff.

1420
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,200
Yes. So discord nitro.

1421
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,360
I've known that discord nitro has existed for a while now.

1422
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,760
Never, never for even a fraction of an iota.

1423
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,960
Have I ever considered, hmm, maybe I'll buy discord nitro.

1424
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,760
You have it. Yes.

1425
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,760
What's what's the benefit other than getting free shit in Warframe?

1426
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,440
What's what made you say?

1427
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:16,440
Yes, this is something I will purchase because I don't understand the appeal yet.

1428
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:20,800
OK, OK, listen, listen to me very carefully.

1429
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,640
I'm ready. I'm ready to get schooled.

1430
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,880
I can I can put love emojis everywhere I want.

1431
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,080
That's my benefit.

1432
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,760
That's all I need.

1433
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,480
Is it just the animated emoji?

1434
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,760
Is that not just animated emojis?

1435
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,320
Just like any any emojis from any server I am from,

1436
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,760
I can put I can put in any other discord that allows custom emojis.

1437
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,280
And I just I can just put them everywhere.

1438
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,280
And it just it just I cannot.

1439
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,280
I cannot function without them anymore.

1440
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,360
This is my life now.

1441
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:56,120
To everyone who's not in the chat right now, just literally everybody listening,

1442
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:01,160
mages mages spamming with these emojis as she's making her point right now.

1443
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:07,240
Yes, I'm just I'm just putting off every single one, not every single emoji.

1444
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:10,720
There's a lot of emojis, but yeah, I can it's just so good.

1445
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,640
It just feels so good.

1446
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,160
I can it's it's it's it just makes me happy.

1447
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,640
That's it. That's that's all there is to it.

1448
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,960
I'm just happy I can do this.

1449
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,080
I wasn't sure if there was more to it because I kind of figured that was

1450
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:26,520
like the the the excelling point for you because I see these all the time

1451
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,400
when you're when you're talking in the chat.

1452
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,640
But I wasn't sure if there's more to it that I was not aware of.

1453
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,720
There might be more to it, but that's what I'm using.

1454
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,600
That's all it took for you to fucking clinch the deal.

1455
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,640
All right, all right.

1456
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:46,560
Since I've been sitting on my ass doing nothing because moving is basically impossible.

1457
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,360
I've been marathoning half in the bag and and best of the worst constantly.

1458
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,160
Like that's just been my life like all week is just getting caught up on that media.

1459
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:59,160
Right. I didn't know you were not caught up on that.

1460
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,440
I mean, I watch it every now and then.

1461
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,880
I mean, I'm caught up on all the Planket reviews and stuff.

1462
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,080
But like I just watch I don't usually watch everyone that comes out

1463
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,160
just if they're talking about a movie that I'm interested in.

1464
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,440
But I've been super bored.

1465
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,440
So I've been marathoning a ton of it.

1466
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:18,160
And best of the worst is like the greatest idea in the history of the Internet.

1467
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,880
I knew that would be your type of show.

1468
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,600
Like because best of the worst is awesome.

1469
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,160
But like I'm not as into it as half in the bag just because I'm not that into

1470
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,920
like those B movies that they watch, you know, like I think it's really funny.

1471
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,480
Some of the stuff they'll get out of it.

1472
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,720
But like it's not my aesthetic so much.

1473
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,480
But like I've always wanted to do something like it with something that would be that.

1474
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,600
I mean, that's kind of it was basically what the inspiration was for Cleveland.

1475
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:49,560
The Wii like we pretty much were copying best of the worst mixed with half in the bag.

1476
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:54,840
Like it was meant to be like a little bit of both just watching these these videos.

1477
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,360
I made a tweet about it earlier in the week, I think, just being like

1478
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:04,120
it just made me realize like, oh, there are like people out there

1479
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:08,480
who have like real friends and like hanging out to something that happens.

1480
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,040
No, you got to remember these guys are they're like us.

1481
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,720
They all met online and then moved into the same place.

1482
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,880
That's why we want to do.

1483
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,600
But now. But now.

1484
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,680
But now they're just like, hey, it's the weekend.

1485
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,920
Let's spin the wheel.

1486
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,320
This is what we want.

1487
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,040
Like this. That's what I.

1488
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,280
That's why I know it's such a like long term goal where it's like

1489
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,200
because, OK, lately, people have been like down on the idea

1490
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,280
that it was still possible to have

1491
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,440
PCPHQ just because like Ben and Munchie really want to live in Boston

1492
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,920
and they're not really interested in leaving for PCPHQ.

1493
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,440
Like they both are they want to live there.

1494
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,720
They have a lot of stuff going on there.

1495
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,280
So they're like they're the kind of like out of the picture for that.

1496
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,800
You know, and I don't want to live in Boston at all.

1497
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,520
So like it would be easier if I was there and everybody was there.

1498
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,400
I hate Boston.

1499
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,320
I love living in Virginia Beach.

1500
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,240
Boston is way too expensive.

1501
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,720
And I don't think it's worth like I understand

1502
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,560
why for Ben living in the heart of Boston with like a group of a ton of people

1503
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,960
that keeps his rent super fucking low and he likes public transit.

1504
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,000
That's fine. Very different lifestyle from mine.

1505
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:24,760
I want to live in a fucking house and I want a car, you know.

1506
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:29,880
So like it like Boston is way too expensive to live that life there.

1507
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,880
Not expensive to do that in Virginia Beach, you know.

1508
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,240
And it's also a lifestyle I'm used to.

1509
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:38,640
And I moved into a much better part of town than I used to live in.

1510
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,400
Like the area I live in now is way cooler.

1511
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,080
Than the area I used to live in.

1512
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,960
So like I'm completely satisfied living here.

1513
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,000
I am not going nowhere.

1514
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,920
I like even just down to the neighborhood I'm in.

1515
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,480
Even if I wanted to like buy a house later,

1516
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:00,000
I would want one nearby, you know, like to where I am right now,

1517
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,400
because I really like where I'm living, because the there's not.

1518
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,000
I have like no complaints like everything I want is here.

1519
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,200
I have a car, so I'm not that worried about public transit.

1520
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,200
You know, I understand why it would be harder for Ben.

1521
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,640
But even then, like down where I'm located now,

1522
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,080
there's a lot more in walking distance than there was.

1523
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,920
I mean, there was nothing in my old place.

1524
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,080
Now I can walk to pretty much anything I would want to walk to.

1525
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,880
So it's not a big deal.

1526
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,200
Fucking sick. Yeah, it's a great area.

1527
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:33,520
So like for me, it's like I'm I'm definitely trying to settle down here.

1528
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,680
There is an apartment complex directly behind me with

1529
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:41,480
availabilities that is not expensive, you know, like Nate or you

1530
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:46,000
or you and Ben or whoever could get a place right behind me

1531
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:50,000
and literally be able to walk to my house in like two minutes,

1532
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,960
you know, or fucking Nate could take his fucking boosted

1533
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,000
board to my place in two minutes, you know, I just I'm just thinking like,

1534
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,880
oh, man, it'd be pretty cool to do like an I am games video game version

1535
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,160
of best of the worst.

1536
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:05,000
People just send in like the shittiest games you could find

1537
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,640
and you just like dig through them.

1538
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,760
I'm like, oh, my God, I have a huge room.

1539
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:13,960
Like, first of all, my living room is gigantic and I bought a fucking couch

1540
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,520
that seats like could potentially seat like nine people on it, you know,

1541
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:23,080
like I have a huge couch for use of purposes such as big group watching,

1542
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:28,320
you know, and I fucking have this one other room that's just

1543
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,320
a big room that could easily be filmed in, you know, like I don't we don't live

1544
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,640
in that room. I just use it for like crafts.

1545
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,480
So build a set in there and it could just be like, you know, Nate takes

1546
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,880
his boosted board to my house every Saturday.

1547
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,640
We set up the set, we film a bunch of shit, you know, and anybody else

1548
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,680
who lives nearby can be a part of it.

1549
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,640
Or if we want to do Radcon, we already have a set built.

1550
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,480
Me and Nate already have a show.

1551
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:58,760
It's easier for us to fund it because we can talk about it on that show, you know,

1552
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,120
like I would think that Nate and I doing a regular show would be at least

1553
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,800
as popular as like the difference in subs between the two of us,

1554
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,440
which is he already has over a hundred K. I've got 350.

1555
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,000
A lot of people are excited to watch our videos, you know,

1556
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,000
I think we would at least pull the same view counts we currently

1557
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,760
pull through like our main channel videos, you know, and that would be

1558
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:26,320
much better advertising for the rest of the PCP for, you know,

1559
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,680
for any projects we were doing together for Radcon.

1560
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:33,120
Like it would be a way bigger signal boost to all of that.

1561
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,160
So like that's why I want it so bad because I think, oh, man,

1562
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,760
this would be a way that if Nate and I live together and we built

1563
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,200
the foundation of this and everybody else could be involved,

1564
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,400
everybody's just going to make more money like just because it exists, you know,

1565
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,280
it's going to be easier for me, even if it was just me and Nate running the main show.

1566
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,840
If Ben comes in for an episode of a show that's got 40,000,

1567
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:01,120
you know, views per video, huge signal boost to his fucking empire, you know,

1568
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,000
like that would be the cool thing about it.

1569
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,600
Yeah, that's that's that's what I want.

1570
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,120
That's what I want to happen. I still, I mean, I'm not like super negative

1571
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:18,640
on PCP HQ. It's just like it definitely doesn't seem like it's going to involve

1572
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:21,640
everybody at this point, but there are people who are still interested.

1573
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,840
But it's kind of like like Ben and Munchy don't want to even be involved

1574
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,600
with it on like a fundamental level.

1575
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,280
Like they would rather probably show up once every six months and it would still be

1576
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,400
it would still be enough for them because they have followings like they don't

1577
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,400
necessarily need to make way more money and they're having a lot of fun

1578
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,560
doing what they're doing without worrying about money, you know, like endless war

1579
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,720
is a nonprofit venture and it takes a huge amount of effort,

1580
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,240
but they're both really proud of it and they want to be a part of a community

1581
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:56,560
of people and they're making enough money to live up to the lifestyle that they

1582
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,400
that they consider to be enough, you know, like Ben is not like crying about

1583
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,360
money all the time, you know, he's he's well, he's crying about money,

1584
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,000
but more about crying about taking down the system.

1585
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:12,680
Right. It's he's crying about money because he would like to have more of it,

1586
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,800
but not because he's miserable with his life from not having enough of it,

1587
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,800
you know, like big difference.

1588
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:22,800
And I think a lot of artists who are at the same size as some of the members

1589
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:29,000
of the PCP like would not be able to sustain themselves on the amount

1590
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,520
they make through their art, but like because our fans are so passionate

1591
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:37,680
and so like, you know, cultish, like it's a they just care enough

1592
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:42,400
to like fund our lives, basically, you know, so like granted, we're not

1593
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:46,920
like we're not bending them to their dollar to fucking be able to afford

1594
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,920
these lifestyles, but like, you know, like in other words to say,

1595
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,120
we're living cheaply, but it's entirely fan funded, you know, right.

1596
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,400
So so like, I understand why they would want to have like closer

1597
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:05,680
interactions with fans and a more thriving community around them,

1598
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,240
because that's what interests them as an artist.

1599
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,480
For me, I'm much more insular.

1600
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,000
I don't really want to communicate.

1601
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,240
Like I have a discord and I'm in there pretty frequently.

1602
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,280
I only go into the Discussing Digi content board.

1603
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:22,400
Like I'm only there to talk about myself and answer questions and talk

1604
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,200
about my videos.

1605
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:26,360
I'm not there to like, just discuss anime with all these guys

1606
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,000
because I don't want to get sucked in.

1607
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:32,240
I will not get enough work done, you know, anytime I start talking on

1608
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,360
discord, it's like hours gone.

1609
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,960
And, you know, I will get sucked up in a conversation and just fucking

1610
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,400
totally lose track of time.

1611
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:46,920
And I want to I just like working a lot harder, more than that, you know,

1612
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:52,160
I would prefer to keep getting things done than to have a conversation

1613
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,880
that goes for hours and I don't really get anything out of it.

1614
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:00,760
Like, you know, in terms of like contributing to my career, you know,

1615
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,600
like, I think at the end of the day, the people into your work would

1616
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,080
prefer you get more work done in the long term anyways.

1617
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,120
So especially if they just like everything I do, which a lot of people

1618
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,480
do and I make a lot of shit.

1619
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,560
So like, for some people, I'm like their biggest source of entertainment.

1620
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:21,080
It's like, I watch an hour of DigiBro content every day because he

1621
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,120
releases an hour of DigiBro content every day.

1622
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,120
So, you know, like, that's a lot.

1623
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:29,600
That's a lot of consumption of one person's work, you know, if I was

1624
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,480
watching an hour of somebody every single day, I would definitely consider

1625
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,680
myself to be a huge fucking fan, you know.

1626
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:35,760
Right.

1627
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,120
It's pretty wild.

1628
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,280
So, um, there are people, I mean, I will watch.

1629
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,400
I might save it up for a while, but I will watch all of Jesse's content

1630
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,840
and I will watch all of Dick Masterson's podcast, you know, which is like three

1631
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:51,600
hours a week.

1632
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,520
So that's like stuff I consider myself a big fan of in the same way that

1633
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,440
people are a fan of me.

1634
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:01,080
So which is why I get it, you know, like, I totally get how people feel about

1635
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,240
me because I feel that way about Dick, you know.

1636
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,280
I feel that way about Dick.

1637
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,800
Sorry for cutting you off, mage.

1638
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,520
What were you going to say?

1639
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,400
Yeah, that's okay.

1640
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,200
I wanted to say maybe we should like start moving on to voicemail sometimes.

1641
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,720
Yeah, we haven't been going for like a while.

1642
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,160
We went for close to two hours.

1643
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,480
Yeah, almost two hours now.

1644
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:17,880
Yeah.

1645
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,000
We can go to voicemails.

1646
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,160
I've gotten everything off my chest.

1647
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,720
I really went on about shirts.

1648
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,280
Dude, shirts, shirts are important.

1649
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:31,120
I feel like coming up the next 12 months, shirts, shirts are going to be a thing.

1650
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:31,640
Shirts.

1651
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,000
I want to get back into shirts.

1652
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,320
You're doing shirts.

1653
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,880
It's all about the shirt life.

1654
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:39,720
I just, I don't want to like overdo the shirts and have people be like,

1655
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,320
I have too many shirts of yours.

1656
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,120
But at the same time, you can never have too many shirts.

1657
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,560
Oh, let me tell you about an idea I have, though, that I might do next year.

1658
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,360
And if I do this, this will be how I do shirts, which is that at the start of the

1659
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:56,720
year, I'm going to buy like basically just a massive amount of shirts.

1660
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,960
And I'm going to create a unique shirt for every day.

1661
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:08,400
And I'll make a vlog basically just for every vlog, like just have a different

1662
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,640
shirt every vlog I'm in, because again, it's very easy to make them, you know,

1663
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,920
like to just make one, just fucking slap it on the thing and it's done.

1664
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,760
So I'll wear a different shirt in every video.

1665
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:23,480
And then I'll set up a website where you can buy any of the shirts that I

1666
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,360
weren't any of the videos they're just made to order.

1667
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:31,000
So it would be like, yeah, buy a medium shirt is what, $25.

1668
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,240
And like you can choose whichever thing that I've worn as your shirt.

1669
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,840
So like each of them would just have been worn in one video.

1670
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,240
But like, if that's the particular phrase you thought was funny, then

1671
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:44,560
that's the one you can buy.

1672
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,560
And it would just be like endless options for shirts, you know, that's pretty neat.

1673
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,160
I like that.

1674
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,120
Um, so that's, that's one idea I have.

1675
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:56,800
And like, obviously no one of those shirts would probably sell all that well.

1676
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,120
But, you know, as soon as you find the one that really makes you laugh,

1677
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,560
that's the one you buy, you know, right?

1678
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:05,680
The possibilities are.

1679
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,240
But I'd have to set up a store that can like do that automatically.

1680
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,560
Cause the way I did all my sales was through email and that was a pain in the ass.

1681
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,280
Um, just because a lot of people don't really know how to write their address.

1682
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:24,080
They, uh, don't remember to put the zip code or they forget little details.

1683
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,800
Have you looked into Etsy?

1684
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,600
Isn't like the whole point of Etsy is like selling handmade items?

1685
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,080
I probably should.

1686
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:34,200
I mean, especially if I'm going to do a lot of this, then I should look into it.

1687
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,880
I don't know if they take a cut, like bandcamp either.

1688
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,280
I haven't looked into it, but like, I'm sure they do.

1689
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,600
That must be how they make their money.

1690
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:41,840
Yeah.

1691
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,640
Cause like, I mean, the best part about doing it the way I did it was that it was

1692
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,800
like all profit, you know, like I get a hundred percent of the proceeds.

1693
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,080
There is no, you know, it either is going towards paying off what I spent

1694
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,880
on the cost of the shirt, or it is just money I have now.

1695
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,720
There is no other money involved.

1696
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:00,800
Nobody else is getting my money, you know,

1697
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,240
you should like set up a Google form that people can fill out if they want to

1698
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,240
buy a shirt and then you send them a paypal.

1699
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,840
That would probably be closer to what I would.

1700
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,080
And then cause when you send them an invoice, they have to put in their

1701
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:14,880
information and stuff in order to have it go through and pay you.

1702
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,320
That might be a good way to do it.

1703
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,640
That keeps it all in house.

1704
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:20,040
I just want to set up a system that'll do it for me, you know,

1705
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,760
automate it as much as possible, but without having to pay for a site, you know,

1706
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:28,440
or like I'd even pay for my own hosting for a site just to have a shop site

1707
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,720
because that would be cool.

1708
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:33,320
But like I would do that over going through like a spreadsheet or something, you know.

1709
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,280
Yeah, look into Shopify then.

1710
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,120
I know there's like a Shopify plugin for how self-hosted websites to let you do that.

1711
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:42,720
Yeah, I'll look into that too.

1712
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,480
All right, let's go to voicemails then.

1713
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,000
Let's do it.

1714
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,160
All right, I have five voicemails for us to go through today.

1715
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,200
If they suck, you can yell at me.

1716
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,200
Tom Oliver says it's Twitter.

1717
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:00,280
This is the best that I could pull from the ones that we have before we get started.

1718
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,280
There was a lot of voicemails.

1719
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,280
I didn't include any of them because they were all long,

1720
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:11,280
but there were like five or six people who called in specifically to defend peeing,

1721
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,000
sitting down.

1722
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,480
I guess that was a hot button topic from one of the previous episodes that I haven't listened to yet.

1723
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:23,120
But yeah, there was there was quite a few people who voiced their disdain

1724
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,440
at I guess we were not too kind to the sitting down,

1725
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,640
well, I believe Nate included that it was inhuman in some way.

1726
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:33,560
Oh, OK.

1727
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:37,520
Excuse him for for guys.

1728
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,200
I'm assuming it was a specific gender issue.

1729
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:46,120
Well, he was the guy's story was that he was getting up to use the bathroom out of bed

1730
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,000
and he doesn't want to have to turn on the light.

1731
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
So he sits down to pee and he was asking if that was acceptable

1732
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,760
and we concluded that it was not.

1733
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,560
I disagree with you guys with your conclusion.

1734
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,200
Well, as a girl, you would normally sit down to pee.

1735
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,760
That's why I don't find it all that way.

1736
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,440
All right.

1737
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:07,720
So our first voicemail is from a gentleman named Pony Lore.

1738
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:10,760
And I figured this seemed to make sense considering

1739
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,160
the the the event going on right now.

1740
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:19,000
It's so let's check it out.

1741
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,200
See if I remember how to actually do this.

1742
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,040
You can do it.

1743
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:27,800
I have faith since major is going to be appearing on podcasts about now.

1744
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,880
I want to ask this question.

1745
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,560
Why is major in the PCP?

1746
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:32,440
I don't get me wrong.

1747
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:35,960
I'm not one of these major haters who's against major being in the podcast at all.

1748
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:39,000
But I still think it's kind of weird that she's in the podcast.

1749
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,640
In the old horse cast, she was only mentioned once

1750
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,640
and doesn't actually appear in the show.

1751
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,720
While I do know that she did found a Skype chat and name it the procrastinators,

1752
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:50,680
I still don't understand the connection that she has to the rest of you.

1753
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,600
Clear up this pony lore.

1754
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,440
I'm friends with you guys.

1755
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,160
Right. That was what I wanted to say.

1756
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:01,640
Is that like, I guess maybe people who don't know the pony history of us

1757
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:04,920
might not be clear of how we met you.

1758
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,040
But like you did.

1759
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,360
You had a YouTube channel.

1760
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,400
You did pony stuff.

1761
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,600
You did pony drawings.

1762
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,800
You were in the community.

1763
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,600
I had promoted Mage on Equestria Daily, I think, like, right?

1764
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,360
Because you did a couple of analysis videos back in the day.

1765
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,720
I never like talked to her personally,

1766
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,720
but I know that you you had started talking to like Ben and Hippo.

1767
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:27,000
And I think you like you've always talked to those guys, right?

1768
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,840
Like, I sort of welcomed into the rift

1769
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,400
the Tibet brothers, the above of them.

1770
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,840
And then that's how I started talking with Ben more so than Nate at that time.

1771
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,080
It was I forgot about the rift.

1772
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:44,680
And that that would be also connected to it for those who don't know.

1773
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,960
There's this thing called it was a Skype chat called the rift cafe

1774
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,280
where everybody who was doing my little pony analysis videos was invited to

1775
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:55,440
because of some weird meme where a couple of guys had collaborated

1776
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,720
and said that there was like a rift in space time between their channels.

1777
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,840
It was very typical style, very that glasses.

1778
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,840
But like they made a giant chat and all of us were at some point in it

1779
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,880
because that's what we were doing.

1780
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,400
But like it was kind of like those of us who were in the the horseshoe group

1781
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:19,120
of friends were like we all knew each other and didn't really know anybody else in the rift.

1782
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,560
So it was like we didn't really hang out there

1783
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,080
because we would rather just talk to each other, you know.

1784
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:29,240
So but I think Mage had, like you said, you invited the team up in there.

1785
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:32,120
And so like you started talking to them that way then.

1786
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,240
Yeah, I think that's how I also met Hippo.

1787
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,120
He was there as well.

1788
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:42,560
Like neither me nor Hippo can I remember how we met, but we just met with you.

1789
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,960
Did you I actually the first interaction I have with you was when I did fanart

1790
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,680
for your cousin, I think, when you asked to design the oh, you did one of those.

1791
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,600
Yeah, I didn't even know that.

1792
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,200
Yeah, that's the earliest interaction I have with you.

1793
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:59,920
But like, yeah, we never really talked to did you much before that we were sort of a sort of like.

1794
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:06,160
We were sort of like it's kind of like how you're in the same house, but never in the same room, you know.

1795
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:11,600
Yeah, well, it's also that you like you hadn't really done many videos like you did three.

1796
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,360
And then I hadn't really heard from you in the time that you were not making them.

1797
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:20,760
So like I didn't know you were still in the community really when then you like put us all on the chat together.

1798
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,000
And I was like, oh, it's Mage.

1799
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,360
She did good videos.

1800
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:29,040
I remember promoting her like, you know, I mean, I made a few not too many though.

1801
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:31,920
But yeah, I was I was quite active in the Rift, though.

1802
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,160
So yeah, like I said, in the same house, different rooms with Tom, how we met initially.

1803
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,560
Do you remember Tom, how we met?

1804
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,520
I don't remember specifically.

1805
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,040
Oh, yeah.

1806
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:45,640
Okay, hold on.

1807
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,160
I remember I remember how I met with you now.

1808
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,760
You might have been in the Rift at that time, maybe not.

1809
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,360
But I know that somehow it got in contact to you with Skype.

1810
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,720
You were having like financial issues and then I did commissions.

1811
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,640
But then the money went to you.

1812
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,000
Remember?

1813
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,800
Oh, God, I think I repressed that because I was so ashamed.

1814
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,880
But now you remember it.

1815
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,160
I'm sorry.

1816
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,480
But yeah, that's how I met with you.

1817
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:13,200
Who else was just I just met through you guys.

1818
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:17,280
I think when I created the Skype group, that's initially how I met Jess as well.

1819
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,600
And then the man she came along.

1820
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,880
But yeah, just we would just sort of hang out.

1821
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,160
I was it was sort of in the friend group.

1822
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,800
And I just ended up with you guys, you know.

1823
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:36,080
Yeah, the point for playing the same as that may not just come out of the ether

1824
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,440
as the diversity hire.

1825
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,960
She's she's been here from the very beginning and we all are friends

1826
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,840
and it is true and it is real and mage is good.

1827
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,760
So there's this major list.

1828
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,880
There's no one.

1829
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,640
I think so.

1830
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,840
Either that or we're all suffering from a very violent delusion.

1831
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,240
Oh, that would be so funny.

1832
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:58,920
I'm your imaginary friend, a collective imaginary friend.

1833
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:04,240
OK, but yeah, it would it would explain your colored history in Lithuania, I

1834
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:09,480
suppose, but yeah, no, I I sort of get why people question that

1835
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,560
because I originally wasn't sure if I should be in your friend group

1836
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,960
because I just need the chat.

1837
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,800
I should have left.

1838
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,200
That's how I felt initially.

1839
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,160
But, you know, like I kept talking with you guys and we're friends

1840
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,120
and I was like, you know, you know, it's OK.

1841
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:26,160
I can I can come on the podcast to and then I did and now I'm here.

1842
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:30,560
I mean, mage, the voicemail reference that you were only mentioned

1843
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,320
like once on the horse cast, I was never on the horse cast at all.

1844
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:39,240
So famous never on the horse cast person.

1845
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:44,040
I don't know if we've I mean, I'm sure we've told the story of like how.

1846
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:49,680
How you got involved, right, was just basically that like you went to

1847
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,560
Brony like it just so happened that you were going to Brony Con.

1848
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,760
And so were Nate and Ben and you guys all lived in Boston.

1849
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:00,320
So they were just like we'll like you were just like looking for a ride

1850
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,600
and they said they would do it.

1851
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,040
Like I don't think you guys had really even talked before then, right?

1852
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,720
We we had talked like casually, just like two people with similar interests,

1853
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,000
you know, on we were both doing videos.

1854
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,600
We talked but not like super hardcore or anything.

1855
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:18,000
Right. I was a fan of T-Bap, but that was pretty much it.

1856
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,200
I think that the the procrastinator's chat probably already existed, right?

1857
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,920
Maybe I think so.

1858
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,840
I think because I think we were all like we all knew each other

1859
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:32,400
and like we were calling ourselves the horseshoe crew by that point, I think.

1860
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,520
And like you came down with them.

1861
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,640
And so like you just heard Ben and Nate for like eight straight hours

1862
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:44,760
talking in the car and it was like a private eight hour T-Bap episode.

1863
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,920
So that's just how they talk to each other.

1864
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:51,520
It's it's crazy like and you still hear some of that on on this show.

1865
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,920
But like, yeah, when they start talking to each other, it's just like they go into a.

1866
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,040
They go into a fugue state, like they just won't stop.

1867
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:01,040
They'll talk together forever, you know?

1868
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,080
They literally can just keep going because they're like close enough in age

1869
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:08,720
and interests that they're almost the same person,

1870
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:11,720
but like reflected in a weird mirror way from each other.

1871
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:15,400
Yeah, it's like the yin and the yang of a singular person

1872
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,440
separated into two distinct entities.

1873
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,000
Right. And I know what that's like because, you know, me and Victor are really close.

1874
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,160
And so we can get into a certain mind state where it's like we're operating

1875
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:30,400
like how we did growing up, you know, like making decisions together

1876
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,440
in a way that reflects how we have always done so, you know.

1877
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,640
I'm a little jealous and because I have an older sister,

1878
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:39,960
but I just I sometimes forget that I'm the younger sister.

1879
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,360
I just forget that I have a sister sometimes.

1880
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,320
We're just that not close.

1881
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:47,560
I wish I had a sibling that was close.

1882
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,920
That's what happens when you grow up and lift

1883
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:51,760
away and you're expected to fight to the death of your siblings.

1884
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:54,840
I mean, for what it's worth, I now see my brothers very rarely,

1885
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,920
even though I now live back in the same area as them, like they're just busy as fuck.

1886
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,280
So it's like I grew up super close to them.

1887
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:06,560
But now that we all have girlfriends and we're all like developing our own lifestyles,

1888
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,240
we're getting like further and further away in interests.

1889
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,360
Like there's tangential relationship between our interests.

1890
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:15,800
Like we all like anime, but not the same anime.

1891
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,000
We're all like video games, but not the same video games.

1892
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,800
Shade is really into like Twitch streaming and shit.

1893
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:27,840
And like playing, you know, MOBAs and shit like that, that I am not interested in.

1894
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,120
Not as maybe as much as that, but like, you know,

1895
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,200
he plays with his work friends who I don't know.

1896
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:38,080
So it's like, yeah, I'm not really like hanging out with Shade all the time

1897
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,000
because what the hell are we going to do together?

1898
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,360
Other than like go get something to eat or something, you know?

1899
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,800
But nonetheless, yeah, I do have a closer

1900
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,400
relationship with them from like growing up.

1901
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:52,480
But yeah, I don't I don't see my family all the time anymore.

1902
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:55,040
And I don't think that's true for most of us.

1903
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,800
I think most of us maybe Tom, you're living back at home, right?

1904
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,160
But your little sister would still be there.

1905
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,840
But I don't imagine you guys hang out every day or anything.

1906
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:06,360
No, I mean, I have two younger sisters.

1907
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,800
My younger younger sister is still here, obviously, because she's still in high school.

1908
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,040
But my other sister has moved out.

1909
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,960
She has like a professional job.

1910
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,000
She makes like $90,000 a year.

1911
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,720
She has like her apartment and everything.

1912
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
She's like a real human being.

1913
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,040
She's a real human being, yes.

1914
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,400
I think I'm actually on track to make six figures this year.

1915
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,400
That would be pretty sick.

1916
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,280
I think it's I think it's going to happen because like my

1917
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,080
Patreon has been really successful.

1918
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,520
I have all these alternative revenue.

1919
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:41,080
I haven't even found out what Manga Mondays is doing for me with the Amazon

1920
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:44,280
Associates link yet, because it's always three fucking months behind.

1921
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,840
Yeah, Amazon is Twitch is the same way.

1922
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,920
Same company. I mean, they're owned by Amazon.

1923
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,480
So yeah, they're fucking literally.

1924
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,920
I was still sending Tom money for I am Games like last month.

1925
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,040
I don't know if there's maybe another check coming possibly this month.

1926
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,760
I don't know how far behind it was, but like fucking mystery.

1927
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,160
Yeah, you make six figures this year.

1928
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,520
Did you might actually be able to pay your fucking taxes finally?

1929
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,800
I hope we'll have that done before the end of what I'm dreading the most

1930
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,200
is that like I figured out the tax situation kind of.

1931
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:19,040
I haven't actually resolved anything yet, but I've gotten advice on like

1932
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,800
basically, I just need to hire an accountant.

1933
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,920
It's probably going to cost me like a thousand dollars,

1934
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,920
but they're probably going to save me a lot of money

1935
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,280
because they're going to find more things I can deduct than I would have found on my own.

1936
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,160
The IRS has a program where if you're a small business,

1937
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:38,280
they will forgive the interest on your missing payments.

1938
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:42,000
So you just have to pay off whatever you would have paid in the first place.

1939
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:48,280
So I will not if I, you know, qualify for that, which I think I can.

1940
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:52,800
At least that's what the accountant who I've talked to for advice said.

1941
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:54,840
Then like.

1942
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:57,920
Who I just know because of Econ.

1943
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,280
So shout out to Econ for putting me in contact with them.

1944
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:06,560
But yeah, they they basically said that, you know, I could and you can set up a payment plan.

1945
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:11,000
So it's like, it's not that scary to me because my dad went into like a massive

1946
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,760
amount of tax debt from like, like over the course of 10 years,

1947
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,320
like not filing his taxes properly.

1948
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:21,040
And the amount of debt he ended up with is similar to the amount I already have

1949
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,480
after two years from just not paying taxes at all in the first place.

1950
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:29,280
But, you know, nonetheless, he set up a payment plan where it's like he just

1951
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,160
pays like a few hundred dollars a month over the course of however long it takes,

1952
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:36,720
you know, I'm going to try to pay it off faster than that.

1953
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,960
I don't want it to be like on my head for years.

1954
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,360
But like I have a bunch of money saved up.

1955
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,280
So like I'm close to a point where I could do it.

1956
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,080
I just have to actually hire an accountant and go through the steps.

1957
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,200
What I'm more worried about is saving up enough to pay the taxes again next year.

1958
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,840
But I don't know how much they're going to reduce it by.

1959
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,640
Like people have said that when you work with an accountant, it will often

1960
01:59:58,640 --> 01:59:59,880
dramatically reduce the cost.

1961
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:01,200
But I don't know if that'll be true for me.

1962
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:04,800
I already feel like I take a lot of things into account that I write off, you know.

1963
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:08,400
Hopefully they know that secret black arts.

1964
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:15,320
That'll, I mean, if Amazon pays nothing in taxes, there has to be a way for

1965
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:17,960
me to pay nothing to fuck it over.

1966
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:21,000
Like right, we're all working with the same general principles here.

1967
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:22,680
I don't know.

1968
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:27,480
Anyways, fucking let's move on to the next voicemail before we get lost in the weeds again.

1969
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:30,040
Yeah, it's about to talk about yengeng.

1970
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,240
Oh, no.

1971
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,080
There's no Ben here.

1972
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,960
We don't have to go down that road.

1973
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,360
This is from Marlowe.

1974
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:40,320
Marlowe has a message for us.

1975
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,960
So you guys at Bronycon have a confession to make.

1976
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:46,720
I could never get into my little pony.

1977
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:52,280
I remember back in 2012, 2013, when the fandom was starting and blossoming.

1978
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:57,000
I heard about it, so I watched a couple episodes and I just could not see what

1979
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:02,600
other people saw in it, like maybe it's because I was an entire audience or maybe

1980
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:08,440
I just wasn't autistic enough to enjoy it, which is weird because I feel like I

1981
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,320
should have been no offense to you guys.

1982
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,240
Like it's weird.

1983
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,760
The PCP is giving me a lot of insight on the fucking debacle that was the MLP

1984
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:24,160
fandom and like I feel like I missed out on something.

1985
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,160
But at the same time, I feel like I missed out on nothing.

1986
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,680
So I'm wondering now that LP is effectively over, what's the final autopsy report?

1987
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:36,400
Tom, do you want to go first or should I?

1988
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,400
I'll go first.

1989
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:43,400
I think I mean, the reason I think I probably got into it as much as I did is

1990
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:46,640
just because like I was just like really fucking depressed when I started

1991
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:50,600
watching the show and it was just a beacon of positivity and like genuine

1992
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:52,040
authenticity.

1993
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,280
Like, did you coin the term at the time, like the new sincerity?

1994
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,760
I did not coin that term.

1995
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,880
I actually, when I first found out about MLP, the Wikipedia article considered

1996
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,480
it a part of new sincerity.

1997
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:07,200
Like it's not something that anybody in the fandom talked about, but it was on

1998
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,320
the Wikipedia article.

1999
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:08,960
What's?

2000
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,120
Yeah, sincerity.

2001
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,440
The new sincerity is a movement of basically just really sincere work.

2002
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:20,160
Like the post irony era, basically, because like the nineties was very much

2003
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:23,600
all about irony and a lot of our media is influenced by that.

2004
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,840
But I believe it was actually the term was made up by the guy who wrote

2005
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,760
Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace.

2006
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:35,240
He was like big into the new sincerity as an idea of like a rejection of that

2007
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,240
former irony.

2008
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,280
But I think like maybe Idea Channel made a video where they compared my

2009
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:44,280
little pony to that, and that's why it was in the Wikipedia article.

2010
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,200
But it seems about right.

2011
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:52,560
You know, I, yeah, you're the one who introduced me to the term and it made

2012
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,000
sense, just like the show was very sincere.

2013
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:59,240
And I think that in the beginning, especially in 2012, 2013, the community

2014
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,680
around it was very much embodying that sincerity.

2015
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:07,360
It was very much expressing enjoyment for the show, understanding that

2016
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:11,400
it was fucking weird and not giving a shit and not letting that like outward

2017
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:16,720
stigma be reflected in people's appreciation for it.

2018
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,680
And it was just kind of genuine in the beginning.

2019
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:22,400
There's a very big difference between when you're looking at it from a

2020
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,720
social angle and when you're in the thick of it.

2021
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:28,600
Because like when you look at what my little pony represented, like the

2022
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:33,320
community around it on like a macro level, it's like a bunch of people who

2023
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:38,200
came together over this show and did a lot of good things and like, you know,

2024
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,560
really seemed to get something out of it.

2025
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,280
Like it made their lives different or better in some way.

2026
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:45,360
And so like you can look at it as well.

2027
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,280
I'm glad the show provided that for a lot of people.

2028
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,760
And when you first get into that community, that's the way you're more

2029
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:54,560
likely going to see it because, you know, you're looking at it from the outside.

2030
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:58,680
Once you're in it, though, and you realize that, yes, it's true that it

2031
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,360
does mean a lot of things to a lot of people.

2032
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:06,320
There's also just a lot of weird fucking people who are, who are treating

2033
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:11,680
it as this weird fame circle jerk and who are really like really oddly

2034
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:15,760
defensive about the show to a point where they cannot handle the idea that

2035
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,440
it is imperfect in some way.

2036
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:24,240
And then there's the people who like have all this drama in the community.

2037
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,280
You know, there's all these different factions.

2038
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,200
There's all these people who have problems with each other.

2039
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:35,040
And it's very petty, you know, and there's, there's people who, you know,

2040
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:39,040
who like their entire self-worth is tied to their success within this fandom.

2041
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:42,280
Or there's people who aren't really interested in the show anymore, but

2042
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,960
they're still going to the conventions because they need to sell records.

2043
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:49,360
And that's the only way that they can sell their art, you know, so like, or

2044
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:52,320
people who are just doing commissions because it's a popular show and they

2045
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,440
can make a lot of money off of it.

2046
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:58,760
You know, like there's so many different elements to it that are once you dig

2047
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:02,720
deeper, you're not going to see it in just the most positive light that you

2048
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,560
could see it in.

2049
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:07,440
You're going to see it as like, yeah, well, I, you know, I know that I got

2050
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:11,240
something out of it and I see that it gave something to a lot of people, but I

2051
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:16,000
also have interacted with a bunch of fucking morons who were into this show.

2052
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:21,600
And, you know, like it's, I know that in order to be deep into this community,

2053
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:26,760
this is something you have to deal with is this, this, these people, you have

2054
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:31,120
to encounter them if you want to be such posted on a question daily, you know,

2055
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:35,960
it was such an interesting blend of just like progression of events.

2056
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:40,240
Cause like when I started getting into the show, I wasn't doing YouTube videos.

2057
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:43,240
I didn't, I was never interested in being a YouTuber at all.

2058
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,360
I was just doing art and stuff.

2059
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:46,160
And I was interacting with that side of the community.

2060
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:50,320
And it was back in 2012, when I first got into it, it was super small.

2061
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:51,760
It was super tight in it.

2062
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:54,160
Everybody pretty much knew everybody else.

2063
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:58,120
And that was the weird thing about it too, is that like it hit like a second

2064
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:03,760
renaissance in like 2012, 2013, where like, yeah, for the first two years,

2065
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,920
most of those people were the only ones talking about the show.

2066
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,040
So they all met and networked right away.

2067
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:13,160
They all became friends and then it immediately got too big and too weird for

2068
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:13,560
them.

2069
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,200
And so they became like a totally different group.

2070
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:20,680
And like when we went to Otsuk or Bronicon the first time, like you knew a lot

2071
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:21,440
of those guys.

2072
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:25,000
So I hung around them because I just followed you around, but none of them

2073
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,560
had any idea who I was.

2074
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:30,800
And it was really surreal because I got to see like from their perspective,

2075
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,000
this is like a place to hang out with their famous friends.

2076
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:38,400
Um, but like for new people coming in, it's a whole different click.

2077
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,800
Like the analysis community has nothing to do with those guys.

2078
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,440
They all came in later, you know?

2079
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:48,080
So it totally changed the nature of what Bronicon is for everybody involved.

2080
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:52,800
But like for us, it's much more like on the ground, talking to fans kind

2081
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,600
of thing when we're at Bronicon, you know?

2082
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:59,640
Yeah, it was, I mean, I kind of found myself torn between those two things.

2083
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:03,280
Like, I mean, 2014 was the second time that we went together.

2084
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:07,480
Like I was jumping back and forth between like hanging out with you and Nate and

2085
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:10,440
Ben and Hippo and everybody and also trying to like go hang out with Saber

2086
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,640
and Jax and all that because like everybody has a little like sub clicks

2087
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,560
and they don't intermingle all that much.

2088
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:19,320
So it wasn't just like, Hey, Digi, Ben, do you guys want to come hang out

2089
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:22,200
with me and Saber and Jax and go like get lunch?

2090
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,840
They have no idea who we are and they're pretty insular, you know, like, right?

2091
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,960
Everyone kind of had their little bubbles and it was never like an aggressive

2092
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:30,520
thing or anything.

2093
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:33,600
It was just like, you know, like you have your friends and they're the people

2094
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,320
you hang out with.

2095
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,520
So like I was in this weird position where I had multiple bubbles.

2096
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:43,680
I had been like very much like a 19th wheel.

2097
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:47,280
Like nobody knew who I was and I could tell it made people a little

2098
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,720
uncomfortable that I was there.

2099
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:52,800
And because I also had Victor and Shade with me who like, even if you

2100
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:57,640
know who I am, these guys are just my brothers, you know, but like I wanted

2101
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:01,400
to hang, like to just be able to say that I like saw all these famous

2102
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,600
Brony people because I had consumed everybody's work.

2103
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:07,000
I knew what everybody was known for, you know, but none of them knew who I was.

2104
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,720
So like, I'm just kind of using you as an excuse to hang out with all these

2105
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:13,720
guys and like get a sense of them as people.

2106
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:16,880
But like, it's weird for me to be there, you know?

2107
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,360
And so that's why I tried not to do that other times.

2108
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:26,880
I was like, okay, I have my own click now, you know, but like I was as famous

2109
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,840
as any of those guys at that time.

2110
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,960
I had just come in way later and gotten big really quick, you know, we were

2111
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,720
establishing a new niche, essentially, that was separate from this.

2112
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:41,960
And it's funny because between 2013 and 2014, we both doubled in size.

2113
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:45,320
That whole community came into its own, became a big part of the overall.

2114
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:49,040
So we were a way bigger thing and like people knew about what we did by next

2115
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:52,080
year, the tables had basically turned, but it was really funny because even

2116
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:57,200
though you and I pretty much like started it as a popular thing, it quickly got

2117
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:00,600
away from us and there were channels that were as big as us who ended up doing

2118
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,960
it for way longer and being way more respected because of the fact that you

2119
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,400
and I quote unquote quit the fandom.

2120
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:11,200
Like we, a lot of Bronies really just hate you if you, if you say anything

2121
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:14,880
negative about the show or if you just leave, if you're like, oh, I'm not covering

2122
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:17,200
the show anymore, they're like, oh, you're dead to me, you know?

2123
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:20,960
Yeah, I mean, that was the big problem that we were facing a lot of friction

2124
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,680
because like we were trying to analyze the show.

2125
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:27,480
And so when it did something bad, like that kind of sucked.

2126
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:31,120
And that was, if you said that, that was like, you know, cursed or not, you're

2127
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,720
not allowed to decry God.

2128
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:35,560
That's part of the reason why I quit the fandom as well.

2129
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,520
Just, just part of it.

2130
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:40,680
But yeah, people like, I started seeing like, you know, more issues with the show

2131
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:44,560
and people immediately assumed I started getting negative or jaded or whatever.

2132
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,720
Inspired or simple ones, though it wasn't.

2133
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:52,440
I recently, well, recently, I say a few months ago, like some person I had

2134
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:57,280
added on on steam, like forever ago, messaged me and, and they, they, they

2135
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,680
started off nice and they just like, oh, hey, you're the mage.

2136
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:03,360
You did the pony things and they started eventually going off at me.

2137
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:04,240
It was like, how dear you are.

2138
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,640
Like abandon your friends, how they must feel.

2139
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:08,360
You're a terrible person.

2140
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:14,040
And I'm like, oh my God, still now in the year of our Lord 2019, people are

2141
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,880
still butthurt.

2142
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:16,280
Yeah, I blocked them.

2143
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:20,760
But like, because they just couldn't understand the idea that I, it's like,

2144
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,600
it's not like I had a fight with anyone.

2145
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:25,160
I just decided to not do the pony stuff anymore.

2146
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:29,080
I'm still, I mean, I still welcome if people like, okay, like, let's say Persian

2147
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,440
poetess messages me and be like, hey mage, you remember me?

2148
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:32,920
And I'm like, yes, I remember you.

2149
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:33,760
You're a good person.

2150
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,520
We were friends.

2151
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,000
I, I'm still, I'm still welcoming people.

2152
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,800
I used to be friends was to talk to me.

2153
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:42,520
It's not like I blocked them or snubbed them or anything, but they just assumed

2154
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:45,640
I ditched them and I betrayed them and everyone's crying about it.

2155
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,640
That's not how it is.

2156
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,440
This person was so.

2157
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:54,800
My hypothesis for all of this, like weird energy that the community always had was

2158
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:59,880
that in the beginning and even to this day, but to a significantly lesser degree,

2159
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:04,120
people on the outside would look at it and Bach, right?

2160
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:05,240
Just like, what the fuck?

2161
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:08,880
Why are these like adults into this children's cartoon for little girls?

2162
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:12,280
And so you would get flack for liking the show.

2163
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:16,760
So you'd come into the community and you'd want to like get positive affirmation.

2164
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,600
You'd want to be like, oh, this is okay.

2165
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,240
I am okay for liking this.

2166
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,720
And so when people on the inside would say anything bad about it, that would

2167
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:27,760
like threaten that narrative that, oh, I'm not a freak.

2168
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:28,640
This is okay.

2169
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,320
Like you just flash out at this is where the biggest problem.

2170
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:35,160
I think that we as the PCP ran into and why we couldn't really participate

2171
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:40,600
for too much longer is that all of us are proud internet weirdos.

2172
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:45,640
Like we are people who identify with the weird or stuff that's on the internet.

2173
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:52,960
We like are into like furry shit or we're into like, you know, weird fetishes.

2174
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:54,480
We're into anime.

2175
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:57,200
We're into like nerdy hardcore shit.

2176
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:00,440
And we don't paint ourselves as like good guys.

2177
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,240
You know, like we're not out there trying to say like, oh, it's, it's

2178
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:06,920
like morally okay to be a fan of my little pony.

2179
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:10,280
It doesn't threaten your masculinity because I'm like more likely to say, fuck

2180
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:17,280
your masculinity, you know, like I'm more into like, there was a huge element

2181
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:22,040
of transgender people in the My Little Pony fandom, huge, huge element of gay

2182
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:26,760
people, huge element of autistic people that was in my opinion, the majority

2183
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:29,880
of the hardcore fans would fall into one of those categories.

2184
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:35,160
And so like to paint it as, oh, like, you know, it's okay to be a guy who's

2185
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:36,080
into My Little Pony.

2186
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,840
Yeah, but it's not really so much like that's not the appeal of it.

2187
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:46,320
The community is comprised of like a lot of people who, you know, who only

2188
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:48,600
really find representation in a show like this.

2189
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,160
And that's what the appeal is to them.

2190
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:54,960
It's not just that it's a girl's show that appeals to guys because it happens

2191
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,560
to be good.

2192
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,600
It also is like a weird pink horse show that is about identity, you know?

2193
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,400
And like that is going to draw a lot of people.

2194
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:06,560
And I think that that element of it attracted me, although I don't really

2195
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:11,120
fall in with a lot of the like the Tumblr crowd who is, you know, who, who

2196
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,640
makes up a lot of the people who cared about it on an identity level.

2197
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,320
But I see it as just like, this is an interesting gathering of people

2198
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:21,480
with mental disorders of which I am one and I want to explore that angle of it,

2199
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:22,920
you know, well, that's, that's the thing.

2200
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:26,320
I think that was really the separation and something that I don't even know if

2201
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:32,840
it's like an age difference thing or like a generational gap is that like we're

2202
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:38,640
doomers and like, I guess the doomer mentality, at least like our flavor of

2203
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:43,920
doomer is just like, I'm fucked up and I accept that and I'm okay with it.

2204
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:47,400
Because I feel like it's kind of like the world invites this, you know, like

2205
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,960
this is what this is what happens because things are the way they are is we

2206
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:57,080
end up with, with these weird mentalities and like we end up being weirdos.

2207
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,400
And like we, we shouldn't have to feel ashamed of that.

2208
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:04,320
Like we should just embrace the fact that yes, what we do is strange, but there's

2209
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:07,440
no objective way to determine what is the right way to live.

2210
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:13,160
So just enjoy being the freak that you are and like, but acknowledge that what

2211
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:14,720
you're doing is not normal.

2212
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:18,240
You know, that is the difference because I feel like people who came after us or

2213
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:22,240
just like the current culture now is that what I'm doing isn't weird.

2214
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:25,200
Society must can say this is normal.

2215
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:26,680
I am still normal.

2216
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:31,280
No matter how fucked up I am, I am still actually normal and I must change

2217
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,720
society to redefine what I do as normal.

2218
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,680
It's like, that's the difference.

2219
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,920
You know, I'm, when I watched my little pony, I was under no illusion that this

2220
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,840
is weird, abnormal and fucked up, but I was okay with it.

2221
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:47,440
There were other people are like, I'm watching my little pony.

2222
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:49,280
Therefore it is not weird anymore.

2223
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:52,120
We must change all of society's perceptions.

2224
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:56,800
And like when I initially watched it to just answer the original voicemail, um,

2225
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:00,960
like I was huge into magical girls shows at the time.

2226
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,720
I like, I had just gotten really into hard catch pre cure, card capture,

2227
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:10,360
Sakura, um, I just like cute shit, you know, and I've always been like a cutesy

2228
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:13,440
and like I've been a weird anime guy for a lot longer than I've been a bronie.

2229
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:19,000
You know, I was like an outspoken lolly con and like just into weird,

2230
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,400
cutesy little girls shit, you know, since way back.

2231
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:25,120
So my little pony falls in line with all that.

2232
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,520
And I saw a lot of people talking about it.

2233
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:33,880
And most importantly, at the time, the whole show was available in 1080p on YouTube.

2234
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,600
It was very accessible.

2235
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:39,040
And that was the biggest thing that made it spread so much was that it was so

2236
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:43,240
easy to just type in the name of the show, get all the episodes and just

2237
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:45,640
watch it out of curiosity for why are people talking about it?

2238
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,960
And like, it didn't stick with me at first either.

2239
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,760
I think the first, the Tom and I agree, the opening two parter is like some

2240
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:54,800
of the worst episodes of the show, I think.

2241
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:55,120
Yeah.

2242
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,360
Um, it's just not very good.

2243
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:00,720
But like once you get into the character specific episodes after that, it gets

2244
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:04,000
more appealing, but like I watched the whole first season and just thought

2245
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,200
it was pretty good the first time.

2246
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,280
Like I was just, yeah, that was fine.

2247
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:13,200
And I wrote a blog post about it, then I caught up to season two and some of the

2248
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:16,440
mid episode, like mid teen episodes of season two, I thought were really good.

2249
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,480
Also, like the first five episodes are all great.

2250
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,920
Um, just in terms of going farther than you would expect the show to go into

2251
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:27,960
having like bigger narratives, more artistic presentation, like big villains.

2252
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:33,800
Um, interesting songs, like pretty good production choices, uh, good character beats.

2253
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:36,640
It's just like, wow, this is going better than I expected, you know?

2254
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:39,800
And then I discovered the community right after that.

2255
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:43,000
And there was just so because first thing I saw was friendship as witchcraft,

2256
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,720
which is a pretty good parody show, you know?

2257
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:50,360
So like that was my introduction to the idea of the Brony community.

2258
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:51,440
And it's like right off the bat.

2259
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:54,320
I know there's actually good stuff being made here, you know?

2260
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:57,600
So I just fucking consumed all of it because I was a Hikikomori neat.

2261
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:02,360
So, you know, I spent two months just consuming all of the fan culture.

2262
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:07,480
And then it wasn't until like six or seven months after that that I actually

2263
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:09,160
started making stuff that got popular.

2264
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,840
So like I hadn't even, I had already gone through a phase where I wasn't even

2265
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,800
into pony anymore before I got famous for doing pony.

2266
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:20,840
Like I kind of came back for season three just to do videos on it.

2267
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:22,000
And then I got really famous.

2268
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
So I kept doing it, but like I had already kind of exited my Brony phase.

2269
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,520
I just kind of re re entered it because suddenly it was the, the, you know,

2270
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,720
my entire career.

2271
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:35,960
Yeah, pretty weird.

2272
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:41,080
But I definitely think like for me, being into a show long term like that is very odd.

2273
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:44,880
It's by far the longest I kept up with the show weekly in my whole life.

2274
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:47,120
By far the most knowledge I had.

2275
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:50,480
Never been as into something like that and never hoped to never be again.

2276
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:52,920
It was probably a bit too autistic.

2277
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:57,160
I think the only thing that's ever been close for me was Undertale,

2278
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:01,000
but that ended a lot quicker than my little pony did for me.

2279
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:04,000
This is just one game the last four hours, you know?

2280
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,640
Yeah, but I loved Undertale so much.

2281
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:12,040
You haven't a clue, but there's just a lot of animation that got like a million views.

2282
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,480
Yeah, an animatic year.

2283
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:19,920
It's not even my most viewed video at this point.

2284
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,720
But yeah, anyway, yeah, I just, I just loved Undertale.

2285
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:23,800
I loved Metaton.

2286
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,840
It's just so good.

2287
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:28,200
When I first saw Metaton, I wasn't too impressed and I thought, you know,

2288
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,560
he's probably going to be very popular.

2289
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:31,720
He has that sort of anime aesthetic to him.

2290
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:35,920
Then like I sat around just for like two, three days and then I was like,

2291
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:38,120
holy shit, I love Metaton.

2292
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:39,880
He's my favorite character.

2293
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:40,240
All right.

2294
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:42,040
What are the voice bills we got, Tom?

2295
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:42,400
All right.

2296
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:45,520
Next one's from Chorb Nohital.

2297
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,840
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.

2298
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:51,080
But what do you have for us, dude?

2299
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,120
A topic is brought up.

2300
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,000
The topic is regarding a group of people.

2301
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:59,200
Did you bro mentions how the discourse on this topic misses the common sense points?

2302
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:02,920
It should be addressing native agrees with Digi, but states that he doesn't

2303
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:04,600
understand the full extent of the issue.

2304
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:07,000
And perhaps if he knew more, he'd think differently.

2305
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,320
Ben St.

2306
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:12,240
Halfheartedly agrees, but says that if things were different, things would be better.

2307
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:16,920
Nate agrees in a conciliatory manner, but says that it's probably the people

2308
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,960
that need to change, not the situation.

2309
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:23,320
Ben St laments the current state of affairs and says that if the situation

2310
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:25,320
were different, the people would be different too.

2311
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:29,040
Munchie laughs absentmindedly at something in the conversation.

2312
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,280
He's thinking of endless war.

2313
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,880
Hippocrite tries to chime in, but he's cut off.

2314
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:36,360
He tries again, but is cut off.

2315
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:39,160
He tries the third time, but stops himself and decides to think about it

2316
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:41,400
more in his own head first.

2317
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:45,240
Tom Oliver says that the entire argument is based on a faulty premise to begin with,

2318
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:47,400
and no solution can be reached from this point.

2319
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:51,280
Mage brings up a point related to her childhood in Lithuania.

2320
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:54,520
Man, her upbringing was freaking whack.

2321
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:58,200
Digibro says he agrees with everybody, but also disagrees with everybody.

2322
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:01,920
And was just as working on a script about this topic right now.

2323
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,600
But halfway through, he gives up the truth.

2324
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,000
Exactly.

2325
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,720
The who is off the grid.

2326
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,720
Nobody knows what he's up to.

2327
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:13,120
Munchie proposes a move to voicemails just when Hippocrite is thinking of what he wants to say.

2328
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:16,080
The voicemails are brought up and mine isn't included.

2329
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,680
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.

2330
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:21,560
That was fucking great.

2331
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:25,720
I'm glad that after 170 episodes, we fallen into a predictable rhythm.

2332
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:27,280
That was really believable.

2333
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:28,880
It's like exactly what it is.

2334
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:31,320
I was like, damn, he's fucking got us pinned.

2335
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:32,760
I'm like, we can just play.

2336
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:35,960
We just play his voicemail for every episode from now to the end of time.

2337
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:39,920
That kind of stuff for me, that kind of voicemail is the ultimate

2338
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:45,040
like fan wink for me because they simultaneously are like kind of making fun

2339
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,520
of you for your flaws, so it's funny and you laugh.

2340
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:53,200
But at the same time, they have to know you really well to know this.

2341
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:56,240
Like they have to have seen a lot of fucking PCP episodes

2342
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:00,040
and really paid attention to the way we communicate in order to understand

2343
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:01,480
how to break it down that well.

2344
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:04,240
And that is how you know you have real fans.

2345
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,840
Yeah, I thought I thought it was too too good, too good.

2346
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:09,160
Had had to give it some love.

2347
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:11,160
It was fucking great.

2348
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:16,760
All right, next one is from Jor, not Jorb, like before,

2349
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:20,560
just Jor and go.

2350
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,000
You know, I've been kind of annoyed with the things

2351
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,760
Ben has been saying lately on the cast, because a lot of it has been

2352
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,520
political hot takes that aren't really funny or interesting to hear about.

2353
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:34,320
But I really have to give him a pat on the back, a handshake,

2354
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:38,760
a bro fist, a limp dick hand job in the middle of the night

2355
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,760
because this Equifax one twenty five dollars thing,

2356
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,600
I never would have heard about it if it weren't for him in the latest cast.

2357
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,400
And it worked. I mean, I'm not American.

2358
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:50,040
I'm Canadian, but my girlfriend's American.

2359
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:52,440
And I had her put her shit into the website.

2360
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:55,440
Turns out she's eligible and she's making one hundred twenty five dollars

2361
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:59,080
for doing nothing. So I have to have to get handed to you, Ben.

2362
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:01,520
You did a good thing. Thank you.

2363
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:04,080
Oh, so one hundred twenty five dollars for.

2364
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:06,120
So last I think it was the last episode.

2365
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,520
I haven't listened to the last episode yet,

2366
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,720
but I'm assuming that's what they were talking about.

2367
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,280
But I've read about this.

2368
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:13,200
Do you remember like a year ago, the Equifax scandal?

2369
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,120
Like what happened?

2370
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,640
Like there's the big this big company that handles

2371
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:20,200
like everyone's private information like the entire country, Equifax.

2372
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:21,560
They had a huge data breach and like

2373
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:25,760
50 percent of the entire country's social security number is just out there.

2374
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:28,720
So you could just get like one hundred twenty five dollars from them as like

2375
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:29,920
a like a coverage.

2376
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:32,400
It's like part of a settlement that if you put in your information

2377
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:35,440
and your information was out there, they'll give you one hundred twenty five bucks.

2378
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:38,840
Every once in a while, May will get one of those from like Kmart

2379
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:41,000
because she worked at a Kmart that went out of business.

2380
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,000
And like, you know, it's like, oh, if you were if you were if you were severed

2381
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,200
because of the fact that we couldn't have your job anymore, like here's a

2382
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:53,560
piece of a class action lawsuit or something like that, you know,

2383
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:56,040
just weird shit like that comes up sometimes.

2384
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:01,240
Yeah, so I guess you could it's at least one hundred twenty five dollars.

2385
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:03,800
But like if you spent time,

2386
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:07,520
like they'll compensate you for your time by the hour up to like I think you can get

2387
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:10,440
up to five hundred twenty five dollars depending on how much time or if you've

2388
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:13,560
been affected or like you had to like work with the bank to get something

2389
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:14,880
reversed or anything.

2390
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:19,520
However, the reason I included this this voicemail is because I wanted to say

2391
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:25,160
we're all fucked because I read another article that Equifax

2392
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:29,920
has only put aside thirty one million dollars for cash payouts because what you can do

2393
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:34,160
is you can choose to either have them give you free credit audits for the next six

2394
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:37,080
years or get one hundred twenty five dollars in cash.

2395
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:40,360
And technically the six years of auditing is worth more.

2396
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:43,880
But why would you trust Equifax with your information again is beyond me,

2397
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,680
like especially if they fucked up this bad.

2398
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,280
So most people are taking the cash payout, but they've only put aside thirty one

2399
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:50,200
million dollars.

2400
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,320
So according to people who are like smart and are following this issue,

2401
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:58,160
because of how many people are picking the cash payout versus how little money

2402
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:01,720
they put aside for it, we're actually going to get a fraction of one hundred twenty

2403
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:04,600
five dollars, probably to the point where it's going to be basically nothing at all.

2404
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:05,960
Well.

2405
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,280
So, yeah, fuck everything.

2406
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:13,360
Good job.

2407
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:17,640
Equifax probably did this on purpose to avoid having to pay huge amounts of money.

2408
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:22,800
So I just want to let you everybody know, prempatively, don't get too excited just yet

2409
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:25,120
because there's literally not enough money to go around.

2410
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,280
Amazing.

2411
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:27,760
Yeah.

2412
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:31,760
So keep your finger on the pulse of that if you're waiting for your check,

2413
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,240
because I have a feeling sorry to that guy with the voicemail.

2414
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:38,480
Yeah, the decimal might be moved over a few places by the time the check comes

2415
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:42,000
in the mail, not in a preferable way.

2416
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:42,800
All right.

2417
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,960
Our last voicemail is from Jack V.

2418
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,760
All right, Jack, bring us home.

2419
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,080
Oh, hey, PCP.

2420
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:57,640
I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't lost on anyone that on episode one

2421
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:02,920
sixty nine of the procrastinators podcast, both Nate and Ben

2422
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:07,880
emphatically and loudly agree that there is nothing morally wrong with adult

2423
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:13,200
consensual incest all the while their sweet sister graces within earshot.

2424
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:14,640
You're a dog.

2425
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,640
You're a dog and I'm sick of it.

2426
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,040
Well, there you have it, everybody.

2427
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:29,160
Another procrastinators podcast in the bag done completed.

2428
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:31,960
We did it.

2429
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,200
We did it a lot quicker than it seemed like it is two and a half hours.

2430
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,800
We didn't feel that long.

2431
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,360
It did not.

2432
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:41,560
Well, when you're talking about just hard, I don't know what is going on.

2433
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:42,880
That's true.

2434
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:44,320
That's true.

2435
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,040
Politics drags forever.

2436
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:49,880
T-shirt talk at just that just that just the time just flies by.

2437
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:54,840
This episode of merchandising or something, I guess so.

2438
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:59,080
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators speaking of merchandise.

2439
02:25:59,080 --> 02:25:59,640
Go there.

2440
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:04,480
Give us your money and you can get access to bonus episodes if you pay five

2441
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:06,600
dollars or more bonus episodes.

2442
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:10,640
We should probably come up with like some kind of merch tier.

2443
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:14,200
I feel like that would be like, I think it would be really neat.

2444
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,160
Me and you had talked about this idea for I am Games called like the monthly

2445
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:22,480
shirt club where it was like a subscription service or something where every

2446
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:24,320
month we would send you a different shirt.

2447
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:27,720
Again, I don't know if this is like overkill on the shirts or whatever.

2448
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:31,520
But like, you know, I mean, I have a care pack with my subscribers

2449
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:36,800
where I I just mail people a a USB stick full of exclusive content

2450
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:40,480
and like an art card with a poem written on the back.

2451
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:43,880
And I sell that for $40.

2452
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:45,960
I make 20 of them.

2453
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:48,000
It's pretty good.

2454
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,160
Yeah, we should do something like that for the PCP and just send them weird

2455
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:53,280
PCP related shit every month.

2456
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,480
It would probably go over pretty well.

2457
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:58,520
Yeah, let us know what you think about that idea in the comments.

2458
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:01,280
If you would pay for something like that, how much would you pay?

2459
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:02,600
What kind of stuff would you want?

2460
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,520
Let us know. Yeah.

2461
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:07,920
Between all of us, we could probably get a lot more varied content

2462
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,400
out the door with something like that, as opposed to just one of us.

2463
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:14,000
So yeah, join join the Patreon.

2464
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,440
Five dollars get you access to the bonus episodes.

2465
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:22,200
The newest bonus episode is a mage and Nate exclusive bonus podcast

2466
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:24,800
because everybody else was asleep or not aware it was happening.

2467
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,120
You guys played Minecraft, if I understand correctly.

2468
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:30,920
Yeah, we played Minecraft on a Pixelmon server,

2469
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:33,240
meaning there were like Pokemon in the background

2470
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:34,960
while we were just doing Minecraft stuff.

2471
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:38,920
That that is the most mage core episode concept I've ever heard of.

2472
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:42,680
So if you want to check that out, five dollars a month.

2473
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:45,360
So it's all it takes bonus episodes.

2474
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:48,240
That's what episode 21, I think, or more.

2475
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:50,440
There are over 20 bonus episodes.

2476
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:52,520
Twenty eight, twenty eight.

2477
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:53,880
We're almost 30.

2478
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:55,280
What are you waiting for?

2479
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:57,040
Give us your money now.

2480
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:00,720
If you enjoyed the dulcet tones of Tom's voice on this episode,

2481
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:02,760
you should also go over to I am Games,

2482
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:07,080
which is an active channel still because Tom is still making gaming videos over there.

2483
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:08,200
Yeah, every week script.

2484
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:11,760
He just sent me for I don't know if this will be out by the time of this podcast

2485
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:15,480
before like an eight page script about Dark Souls healing systems

2486
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,000
that was blisteringly in depth.

2487
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:23,360
So if you want to hear Tom go full souls fanboy after years of shitting on it,

2488
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:27,720
subscribe to I am Games and do it.

2489
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:31,680
It's good. Tom's Twitter so you can support his actual art.

2490
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:34,360
Please do play my game.

2491
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:38,640
Public demo on new grounds, so patrons get access to beta.

2492
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:41,720
It is the only morally

2493
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:44,880
acceptable thing to do considering the state that Tom is in.

2494
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:50,160
You your only your only option is to give this man

2495
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:54,560
support me for the quality of my art, not the lack of quality of my spine.

2496
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,840
God damn it.

2497
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,600
But do you want if Tom dies,

2498
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,960
do you want it on his conscious that you didn't help to fund him to have back surgeries?

2499
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:08,160
Fund my back surgery, donates my Patreon today.

2500
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:13,560
Yeah, mage, anything you want to shill before we close out?

2501
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,520
As ever, never, nothing matter.

2502
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:19,200
Purple's still good.

2503
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:21,120
Yeah, purple love, I guess.

2504
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,320
Purple, purple good.

2505
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,680
That's it, everybody.

2506
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,320
Maybe one day, maybe one day I'll have something, but not today.

2507
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:28,400
When your secret project's done, hopefully you'll probably.

2508
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:29,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2509
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:34,640
When my secret project is done, I'm going to I'm going to show it off like like my child's drawing.

2510
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,760
All right, sick.

2511
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:41,440
Well, until the secret project revealed, you can all ruminate on its contents

2512
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:47,080
and give us money and follow us on Twitter at tbcrasnators.

2513
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,600
I think we still use that occasionally when we feel like it.

2514
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,960
Follow all of us on our Twitter, because we're all over there all the time.

2515
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,360
And yeah, have a good day.

2516
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:58,800
Like a billion pictures of all of them at BrodyCon.

2517
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:02,040
Yeah, all the non fucking stop.

2518
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:02,840
Rapid fire.

2519
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,200
Munchies channel for more.

2520
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:07,440
Munchie and Gibbons channel, I think, have been posting videos from BrodyCon

2521
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:10,040
if you want to see all that shit, too.

2522
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:11,800
Bye.

2523
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,800
Goodbye.

2524
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:21,600
Yeah, I'm supposed to be working right now.

2525
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:29,920
I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working.

2526
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:32,600
I'm doing nothing.

2527
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:35,240
Why did come jerking?

2528
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:37,920
Myself, I'm sucking.

2529
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:40,600
I am an asshole.

2530
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:43,200
I am a stupid.

2531
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:45,880
I've got a deadline.

2532
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:48,240
Don't want to do it.

2533
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,320
Delicious.

2534
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:06,720
I eat when people have like this ASMR when they're eating food.

2535
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:09,240
It's like the worst ASMR.

2536
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:10,240
Stop.

2537
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:11,240
What do you want me to say?

2538
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:12,240
Stop.

2539
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:13,240
I should.

2540
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:14,240
Stop.

2541
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:15,240
No.
