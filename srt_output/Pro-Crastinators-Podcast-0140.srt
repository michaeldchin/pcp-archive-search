1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now, it's so interesting.

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,360
Surprise motherfucker, it's me, Best guy ever back from The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,120
You thought you were rid of me, but no, I am eternal and I'm come back and I'm bronzed

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,440
and I'm beautiful like none of you will ever be or even understand.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,640
With me is Ben Saint.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,680
Everyone put away the good weed.

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,760
We only smoke shit weed when this guy is around.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm here, I'm ready to turn in, I'm ready to phone it in for another PC paycheck.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Oh yeah.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,040
Digibro is there as well.

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,880
The motherfucking mission, get that quack.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Agreed.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
And also Mage.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I am alive as I usually am.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well fantastic.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,760
Well here we are today, post Christmas.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,360
How was your Christmas guys?

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
I had a good one.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
You know what?

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,960
I guess I wish Christmas shit.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Damn.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
Alright, I got a bunch of chocolate that I'm not going to eat.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm donating it to the poor, a.k.a. my fucking housemates.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, that sounds like the poor.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm curious, because you guys are brothers, did you have any kind of, did you guys meet

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,240
at all in this Christmas?

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,240
No, Nate betrayed us.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,040
Betrayed his family lineage and went to Hawaii instead.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,440
For the first time ever, it was not all of us together for Christmas.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Which made me a little sad.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
It was the first time ever.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Yeah, it made all of us sad.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,680
Made all of us real sad.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Aw man.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
You might say it ruined Christmas.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Not my words, not my words.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:25,080
It's good to know that my absence is felt deeply and woundingly by those who know of

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
me and respect me greatly.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,840
Yeah, it was too bad, but you know, also fuck you guys, so I had a good time out there.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,560
My gift, basically, to me on Christmas was to be in a very sunny, beautiful place.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,360
It was like, I want a white Christmas, white sand, that is.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,520
Yeah, also not so many blacks.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,120
Not so many blacks, let's just, you know, tropical cocaine.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Although a lot more browns, you know, because there's a lot more Asians, a lot more Filipinos

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,360
and a lot of, of course, native Hawaiians as well.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Whoa, I'm clogging my ears.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I love none of this.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Hey, by the way, have you guys seen?

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,720
This tickles me pink, or perhaps other colors, because if you invert the word brown, it kind

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
of looks like N-word backwards.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
That's all that.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,680
This is, this is making the rounds, and I feel like there's something important going

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
on here.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,880
Hold on, I'm trying to picture it in my head, but I can't.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
Yeah, take your time.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,320
Literally N-word, like that, like literally the phrase N-word, you gotta picture that.

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, if you switch the B to a D, because it's reversed.

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,880
Wait, hold on.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
It just works.

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
It just works.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Link in the description.

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
This is important to show notes, kind of.

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, RD.

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Oh my God.

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Oh my God.

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Well, this changes everything.

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Yeah, I know.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
I know.

70
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,800
Anyway, it was great, it was nice, so it was with Michelle's family, and we had a wonderful

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
time.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah, that's it.

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Went swimming a lot, did beachy things.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
I am, in fact, quite bronzed.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,840
In fact, we have to link in the show notes to instagram.com slash bestestguyever.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
We can see my bronze.

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:13,720
Hey, remember when you called us up on Christmas, and we all started chanting a vote for Trump,

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
build that wall?

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
I do.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Oh, what a magical time.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,320
I can't even imagine being at the fucking beach, because I was up in the frozen north

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,120
of Rochester, where there was snow, and there actually isn't snow here in Boston this year,

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
so far.

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Yeah, I had a good time, because I was also with May at her family, and they have like,

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,800
you know how they say like, divorced parents have two Christmases?

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,760
She's got that on top of that her mom's family has like three Christmases themselves, because

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,600
it's like every different grandparent gathers like a huge, it's a gigantic Italian Catholic

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,640
family, so there's like a thousand people, and like a million events.

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,880
So it was like a jam-packed like Christmas schedule, you know, it wasn't just like one

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,320
day event, it was like a week long Christmas Trist.

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
It was like a Hanukkah for the Christians.

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,720
That sounds exhausting, to be honest.

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,440
Well when you've got a dab pen and a lot of alcohol, and you know, you're getting lots

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,240
of free stuff from people you've literally never even seen before in your life, it's

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
pretty exciting.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,040
I feel like I want one of those, you know, muscly arm like handshake picks, the meme

97
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,400
with the text over both arms, one that's like, I don't know, epic memers, and then vapors,

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,080
and then in the middle is loving the dab, you know, something along those lines.

99
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
There's potential there, there's potential.

100
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,120
Hey, so hey remember, you know what this podcast has been missing a lot of recently?

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,960
It's been missing that, it was the sauce in the good old days, was me vaping into the

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
microphone.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh yeah, that's true.

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Did you get a new vape?

105
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,560
Did Santa bring you a shiny new vape for Christmas?

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,320
Actually our sister just gave me a jewel, so I'm jewelin'.

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh boy.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Oh okay.

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Oh yeah.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Wait, what's the jewel again?

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
That's just like a little baby one, right?

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,240
It's just a small little like vape thing that looks like a USB.

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
God, you're so degenerate out there.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,720
She had a spare one, and she was like, I don't use this one anymore, you can have it.

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Guys, currently right now in New York, they are in the process of simultaneously legalizing

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,680
marijuana and trying to ban like jewels and vapes.

118
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,040
I assume by ban, they mean like in the same way cigarettes are banned like from like public

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,920
areas, like as opposed to completely illegal.

120
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,400
No, they're just trying to take jewels off the market because they think that too many

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,320
like kids are the ones who like it's basically marketed to kids the way they see it, I guess.

122
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,240
Well, they are popular with the youth, which is bad.

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,800
I don't think kids should be should be vape and nicotine.

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,320
That's weird.

125
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
But I mean, I don't know.

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Yeah, I don't see commercials.

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
I mean, they don't sell them to kids.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
So it's like, what are they fucking?

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Is it the same way that kids get alcohol?

130
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,240
Like kids are going to get their hands on the thing, you know, yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Like if they it like, yeah, illegally, I mean, they're you can just get somebody to buy it

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
for you, assumably.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,800
I mean, if anyone under 18 is smoking jewels, then obviously that's not a fault of it's

134
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
not.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
I don't think it's cause for them to be banned unless you were going to ban everything else

136
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,320
that kids could also do that.

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,160
They didn't ban cigarettes because Joe Camel was a kid friendly advertisement.

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,360
They just said you can't run those ads anymore.

139
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
It's not cool.

140
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Although, I guess a lot of the limitations on sales were probably put in for those reasons.

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Well, I mean, aside from it being like, you know, what is it now 18 or older, I guess

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,840
for cigarettes, I like all the warnings that they were like forced to put on the cartons

143
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,680
and like, I don't know, does that shit even work?

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
Does that have an effect?

145
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I don't know.

146
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I don't know.

147
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,200
Uh, they got them, they got, they got warnings on, on jewel stuff, they got warnings on vape

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
stuff.

149
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah.

150
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
So like, you know, the system seems to be working properly.

151
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Well, fair enough.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Uh, I don't know.

153
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,760
Is vaping even particularly bad for you other than that you get addicted to nicotine?

154
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
No.

155
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,960
It's kind of undiscovered thus far, right?

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,040
Isn't the science still kind of out on that?

157
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,760
I mean, sure.

158
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:32,520
I mean, yeah, in the sense that any scientific theory is always, you know, subject to future

159
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,320
evidence, you know, in order to, to shift consensus.

160
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I guess so.

161
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,040
But, uh, you know, all, like none of the, none of the chemicals in it are like known

162
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
carcinogens.

163
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
It, it, okay.

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,000
People argue with me about this, but like I've done reading on it and I'm pretty convinced

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,280
that, that nothing in it is actually like dangerous, like to, to even like a, a, a,

166
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,160
to even like, like a, a, a percent of the degree that like the stuff in cigarette, like the

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,760
stuff in cigarettes we know causes you cancer, it just, it just does.

168
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh, that's fair.

169
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,040
But like people would also make that same argument about sugar, which I would argue is poisoning

170
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,520
a large amount of the human population.

171
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,600
Well, you know what?

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,920
I think that I would probably be okay if we said that, if vaping is, is, is poison on

173
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,480
the same level as like sugar.

174
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,640
I, I guess that's fair.

175
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
I guess that's fair.

176
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Yeah.

177
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,120
Uh, but hey, Mage, well, how was your Christmas?

178
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
What'd you get up to?

179
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
Uh, it was, it was fine.

180
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
As always, I went to visit my family and was gone for the week or so and been on my phone.

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Uh, was, was Santa kind to you?

182
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,500
Did he, did he lean your, did he lovingly take your, your head in his arms and caress

183
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,820
you on that Christmas morning as is little Lithuanian custom.

184
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Uh, sorry.

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Yo, wait.

186
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,020
He's a very, he's a very my, he's a very intimate man in Lithuanian lore, as I understand

187
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
it.

188
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,260
No, uh, I said, um, you guys have Krampus over there?

189
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
No.

190
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,500
I tell you, we got Krampus over here and it fucking sucks, man.

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,620
You have, you have Chris, you have Chris Kindle.

192
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
No.

193
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,460
Oh, you know, some, some, some places have the Chris Kindle.

194
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah.

195
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,900
It's like Western Europe, I'm Eastern Europe, but uh, yeah, like Santa's not, not, not super

196
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,180
generous with poor, to poor people.

197
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh no.

198
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,740
Uh, but I didn't, I didn't get a thing, uh, sort of two things, I guess.

199
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Um, yeah.

200
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Lay it on us.

201
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
Yeah.

202
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,860
I got, I got a new handbag that I didn't, I didn't request specifically, but it's kind

203
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
of a funny story.

204
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,260
Is it that Gucci?

205
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Is it that Louis?

206
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
No.

207
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
No, it's not, it's not anything.

208
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Expensive.

209
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
It looks nice though.

210
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,420
So, I mean, I don't care for brands, so it doesn't bother me, but uh, uh, it's red though.

211
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,460
And that's a little bit of a, for me, but it's kind of my fault.

212
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
How bold.

213
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Red though.

214
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Yeah.

215
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,860
I don't usually wear red, so it's a little weird, but, but like I said, it's kind of

216
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,220
my fault because during the summer, I'm, uh, me and my mom went for some shopping because

217
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,700
she insisted I got new shoes, but my old shoes are fine, but she insisted I got new shoes.

218
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
I hate shoes shopping.

219
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,300
I absolutely hate shoe shopping, but yeah, we went, yeah, we went shoe shopping and the

220
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,580
only pair that we could find that like fit me properly and I wasn't like batter anything.

221
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,140
There were a pair of red shoes and they were kind of nice, I guess.

222
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,500
And I sort of offhandedly said, you know, like they're nice, but I don't have anything

223
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,940
reds to go with it because it would kind of be weird to like be dressed in all black

224
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,580
and just suddenly red shoes, it just draws attention too much.

225
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,700
You look like Jade from Homestuck.

226
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,180
I was going to say the Wicked Witch of the West, but same person.

227
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,580
So your mom's interpretation was buy you something red so that you have something to go with

228
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
the shoes.

229
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,580
I kind of, I kind of treat the disease, treat the disease, not the symptoms.

230
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,660
I did my own grave though because I did, I did sort of offhandedly said like maybe my

231
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,220
handbag was red or something to match with it.

232
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,420
So because I was thinking like in terms of character design, how to like weigh out the

233
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,580
redness.

234
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
So you're something.

235
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,580
You dug your own grave.

236
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
Yeah.

237
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Yeah.

238
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
I dug my own grave.

239
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
It's not that I dislike it or anything.

240
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
I prefer my purple one though.

241
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
It has more pockets.

242
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
More pockets is better.

243
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,900
I have a section for all the little things that I need.

244
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,140
Like there's a section for my keys, there's a section for like handkerchiefs, there's

245
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,620
a section for everything.

246
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,260
Well, this one doesn't have enough sections.

247
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,900
I mean, as a big fan of the Mage cast, I wonder if maybe these will be worn by red mage.

248
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Remember?

249
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Remember there was red mage.

250
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Red and blue mage.

251
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Remember them?

252
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Yeah.

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Well, she wasn't red.

254
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Well, she red.

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Did I make her red?

256
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I made her red.

257
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Yeah, there was a red one and a blue one.

258
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Oh yeah, okay.

259
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,260
Don't nitpick on the goddamn like fucking, oh no, it's only slightly off on the hexadecimal

260
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
value.

261
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Oh no, yeah.

262
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,980
This is actually the red one was magenta and the blue one was technically mauve.

263
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,060
So, you know, don't at me.

264
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,780
I made them past.

265
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,500
Why don't we mauve on from this boring ass topic, shall we?

266
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,820
How about your ass is grass and I'm going to mauve it?

267
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
What was that?

268
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
What else did you get?

269
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
What was your second gift though, Mage?

270
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:22,660
Then the amount went past post Christmas shopping and she got me a coat because she

271
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,620
insisted my old coat wasn't looking nice and I'm like, but it's fine.

272
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,020
And she was like, Mage, it's 10 years old and I'm like, but it's fine, but she got

273
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,940
me one and it's sort of purplish kind of.

274
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
So I'm happy.

275
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,300
Well, this is why you have to you have to ask for something specific for Christmas.

276
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
I didn't.

277
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,180
I didn't like, I couldn't add like all the things I want is out of my family's budget.

278
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,500
So I was like, I'd be fine with a new sweater, honestly, because I could use a new sweater.

279
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,740
But yeah, I mean, my mom usually asks me if she has nothing in mind, but if she has her

280
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,580
heart set on something, she'll do it.

281
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,220
So there was really no point if she didn't ask me.

282
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh, I want for Christmas is freedom from this damn patriarchy.

283
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,420
That's where I'm at.

284
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I don't want to sound like an ingrate.

285
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,460
I love my mom and she, she did this because she cares for me and I appreciate it.

286
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Of course.

287
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,460
No, she wants me to be warm and she wants me to be comfortable.

288
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,260
A fair bit of bitching about our loved ones is always warranted and that's within Christmas

289
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
parameters.

290
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Yeah.

291
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
Of course.

292
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:41,500
Those motherfuckers only spent $400 on me and I wanted something for 600.

293
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
You know what?

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,140
I think I talked about this the last time I was on, but like you make a deal where like

295
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,500
you talk to them about like, you know, I want that I like, I remember once I wanted a camera

296
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,900
and I'm like, this thing's like 500 bucks, guys, just pay as much as you want.

297
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,620
I'll pay the rest and then we'll just, we'll just work this out.

298
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,300
Uh, they got, they got me the, they, they got me the, they got me the jewel plated tooth

299
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,900
teeth grills that I asked for, but they got them for me in sterling silver when I asked

300
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
for gold.

301
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
What the fuck?

302
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
God damn.

303
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,020
Uh, that reminds me of like, now my teeth won't match my brass knuckles.

304
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,180
Uh, it reminds me like, oh, those posts I see every, every holiday season of when kids

305
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,700
like, like, oh, they got me the wrong colored iPhone or like the wrong colored car and I'm

306
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,660
just like cringing like my iPhone won't match my car.

307
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,580
It's such an expensive gift and they're still ungrateful and it's not like they're sort

308
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,380
of like sighing about it.

309
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,660
They're like mad about it.

310
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Like, yeah.

311
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
You know what?

312
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,620
I'm siding with the rich kids on this one because you know what?

313
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
You know what?

314
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,940
Those parents are rich enough to just buy whatever the fuck their kids want, but they're not

315
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,060
fucking listening when the kid tells them they want the black one, not the white one.

316
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,780
Maybe they should open up their fucking brain a little bit.

317
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,180
I would be, I would be kind of annoyed if like my parents were insisting on spending

318
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,380
that much money, but we're going to get it wrong in some way.

319
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Yeah.

320
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Right.

321
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,980
There was so much on the line here for you to get right.

322
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Yeah.

323
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
How could you fuck this up?

324
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,260
You just spent $900 on the wrong thing.

325
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Like what the fuck were you thinking?

326
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,180
Thanks for ruining Christmas, mom.

327
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,460
Sometimes the color difference is like a very large sum of money of a difference and sometimes

328
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,820
they just don't have just enough for that.

329
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
That can be true.

330
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
I guess so.

331
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,900
I mean, if there's extenuating circumstances, it's different, but if they just straight up

332
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,580
picked the wrong color, it's like you fumbled at the, at the last yard.

333
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,820
If it was just as easy for them to pick the pink one versus the purple one or whatever

334
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,540
and they picked the wrong one, then what that shows is a lack of giving a shit about the

335
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,860
details of this transaction when they may have meant a lot to the person.

336
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,380
It's like on the Kiki Ghibli cast.

337
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,140
You know, you can side with the old lady, yeah, the old lady, you know, oh, she works

338
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,220
so hard to make this herring and, herring and pumpkin pie or whatever.

339
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
But you know.

340
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,660
The girl didn't want it in the first place.

341
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,500
The girl told her she doesn't like that pie.

342
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
So why did she make it?

343
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,860
Why did she go to all that trouble if she just listened?

344
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,140
She should have known to just get her, to just get her a fucking gift card to Dunkin'

345
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Donuts instead.

346
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140
Yeah.

347
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
That's a far more thoughtful.

348
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
She always says she won.

349
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah, but there has to be a bitch about it.

350
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,980
It's a grandma.

351
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,460
But she is a bitch about it.

352
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Yeah.

353
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
That's rude.

354
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
Oh.

355
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Well, she wasn't.

356
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Okay.

357
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Well, she wasn't a bitch to the grandma.

358
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
She was a bitch to some random delivery girl.

359
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
That's also rude.

360
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,660
Don't be a bitch to delivery people.

361
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
And she wasn't.

362
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,140
She's just like, oh, I hate this pie.

363
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
Yes.

364
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,380
She was rude.

365
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
She wasn't that bad.

366
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
She was rude.

367
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
You know what?

368
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
She was rude.

369
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,380
You opened my eyes.

370
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
Did you open my eyes to that scene?

371
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,380
I saw.

372
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,380
It's because I'm spoiled as shit so I can relate better to the spoiled characters than

373
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
the, like, two days.

374
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
Band is not allowed.

375
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,780
Only wholesome things.

376
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
Being spoiled is wholesome.

377
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
It's wholesome.

378
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
It's wholesome.

379
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
Kind of.

380
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Being spoiled is wholesome.

381
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:10,100
Speaking of being spoiled, I was so gratified to log in to teespring.com and see that it

382
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:18,220
immediately, upon posting the I'm Just Being Cool shirt, a flood, hundreds of thousands,

383
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,260
literally every single one of our viewers bought that shirt.

384
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Yeah.

385
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
And yeah.

386
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,500
What shirt?

387
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
It's not true, by the way.

388
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
This is a fantasy.

389
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
This is a Christmas fantasy.

390
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh, sorry.

391
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I was confused.

392
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,780
But you can make it real by going to teespring.com, whatever slash whatever, link in the show

393
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,820
notes below or also the main description.

394
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,660
It was the I'm Just Being Cool shirt, which I mean, in last episode I said in the episode

395
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,780
I'm going to make the I'm Just Being Cool shirt and I did.

396
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Now I understand.

397
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
And your fantasy.

398
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
Okay, I get it.

399
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Okay, I get it.

400
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
I love to speed.

401
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,780
I do like it.

402
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,380
A bunch of what I asked for from, yeah, that nice, that tasteful comic sans.

403
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,260
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

404
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,060
Just showing how serious you are about being cool in the, in the, a bunch of the stuff

405
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,860
I asked for for Christmas, because I couldn't think of a lot for my parents to get for me.

406
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,260
And you know, they'll dig, oh, what do we get you?

407
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
We got it.

408
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
We got to get you stuff.

409
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Mom, just give me cash.

410
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Just send me a check.

411
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
No, no.

412
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,260
So I had him get me a bunch of endless war merch from the, from the RFC cake store.

413
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
I see.

414
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Yeah.

415
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
You had them buy your own merch.

416
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Assumably you get kickback from that too, right?

417
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Yeah.

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Yeah.

419
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
You're getting them coming and going.

420
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Who made it go?

421
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Well, Munchie gets half.

422
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
Munchie gets half.

423
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
That's right.

424
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,260
You know, that was also my Christmas present to Munchie was getting my parents to buy a

425
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
bunch of RFC cakes.

426
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Cleverly fucking played.

427
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Yeah.

428
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Yeah.

429
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
That's not bad.

430
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,260
I mean, you know, I got to, I got, this way I got to splurge.

431
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
I got to splurge on the big one.

432
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,260
Next year I'm going to tell everyone to just subscribe to my Patreon for Christmas and hope

433
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,260
most of them forget to unsubscribe before the next month.

434
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
You know, it's not a bad idea.

435
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Oh my God.

436
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
That reminds me.

437
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I don't know if I should say a name or anything, but I checked my email the other day and someone

438
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,860
whose name I have seen and like comments and I think he's in my discord and stuff, someone

439
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,260
just sent me like a hundred bucks as a Christmas present.

440
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
Sweet.

441
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
Why not say their name?

442
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Thanks, David Toth.

443
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Appreciate it.

444
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
There you go.

445
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,260
Security number 81723, you know, IP address.

446
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:44,260
I have geo hacked your location to send you a card and I'm going to say it out loud now.

447
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
That's sweet.

448
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
That's sweet.

449
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Yeah.

450
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
I don't know.

451
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
I guess on Christmas.

452
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Christmas inclusion.

453
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
Did you guys?

454
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Christmas is bad.

455
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
No.

456
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Christmas is good because I love to go to the movies on Christmas.

457
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
And it's a great time.

458
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,260
What movie did you see on Christmas?

459
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I saw Into the Spider-Verse.

460
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
I saw On Christmas Day.

461
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Please don't spoil.

462
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Please don't spoil.

463
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
I really want to see it.

464
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Okay.

465
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
I won't spoil it.

466
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
I'll just tell you it was very good.

467
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
I liked it a lot.

468
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Everyone's telling me it's really great and that I should see it.

469
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I haven't seen a single negative opinion about it.

470
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
We got to do a little X-Nate on that.

471
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
What is it?

472
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Acke, Blay, Erector K.

473
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,260
You know, let's get some more white boys in there.

474
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
Other than that though.

475
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Who was it in the PCP?

476
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,260
We were talking about how the movie flopped abroad.

477
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Did it?

478
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
Because in China.

479
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Oh, the only white people in China or something, right?

480
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,260
They didn't show miles in any of their advertisements.

481
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Oh, that's fucked up.

482
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
Yeah.

483
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,260
The ads in Asia made it seem like Peter was the main character.

484
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
Thank you.

485
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Because they didn't think a black person would sell and lo and behold, it didn't.

486
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Well, I guess I aptly played.

487
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Unfortunately, it wasn't enough, I guess.

488
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
That's too bad.

489
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Because it's really good.

490
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
You should watch it in China and enjoy it.

491
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I highly recommend it.

492
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Go watch it in China.

493
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah, it's China.

494
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
I'm not saying it's not great or good.

495
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,260
But, you know, superhero movie.

496
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Spider-Man.

497
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Oh, man.

498
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
No, I hear you.

499
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
I won't go into detail.

500
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Because I don't want to spoil it for an agency.

501
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,260
I'm not even burnt out on superhero movies because I don't watch them.

502
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,260
I haven't even seen Infinity War.

503
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,260
The last superhero movie I watched was Iron Man 2.

504
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
This movie?

505
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Okay.

506
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
So, I'll just say it in general.

507
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Or maybe the first Captain America.

508
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Into the Spider-Verse was really good.

509
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,260
But Infinity War was way more interesting conceptually.

510
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Although, this spider shit was the best looking movie I've ever fucking seen.

511
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,260
So, it's got that going for it.

512
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,260
But everything about Thanos was just way more interesting.

513
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
I'll remember more.

514
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Whereas, I mean, this was about another hero becoming a hero.

515
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Doing hero things.

516
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I've seen it.

517
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
I get it.

518
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,260
So, when I call this one of the best things I've ever seen,

519
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
like some people were saying, absolutely not.

520
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Infinity War kind of was.

521
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
So, that wins on that front.

522
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Yeah.

523
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
I don't know.

524
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Everyone should see it anyway though because it just looks so fucking good.

525
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
And Kingpin.

526
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Oh, my God.

527
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
Kingpin's design is so sick.

528
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,260
He's just the biggest man I've ever seen with his little head.

529
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
It's so sick.

530
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,260
I know it's not original.

531
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,260
But man, should you like Spider-Gwen's design a whole lot?

532
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
It is sublime.

533
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I was gonna ask if Spider-Gwen was in there because it seems like he was.

534
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I saw her in a trailer.

535
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
She's so cute.

536
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
I like the colors.

537
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Spider-Gwen's so cool.

538
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Yeah.

539
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Colors are great.

540
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
I mean, I love her costume and all.

541
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't know if I like that her like buzzed undercut hair thing.

542
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
It's just not really the hairstyle.

543
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
I'm into that.

544
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Me and Michelle saw it at the same time.

545
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,260
And a slight point on that was just that we both commented,

546
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
as we finished and were walking out,

547
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,260
they sure did that whole Gwen's better than all the boys thing.

548
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
So that was cool, I guess.

549
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Was she the Lola Bunny of the film?

550
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Well, only slightly.

551
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,260
She wasn't sexualized or anything to that degree.

552
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
But whatever.

553
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
That was only at the beginning.

554
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Anyway, everyone should go see it.

555
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
I guess that's just the short version.

556
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,260
So you heard it here, everyone.

557
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Into the Spider-Verse is a feminist propaganda nightmare

558
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
that you should all avoid.

559
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
It's intersectional, too.

560
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
Absolutely.

561
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
I don't even know what that means.

562
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
I mean, Miles was great.

563
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Miles ruled.

564
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
I don't know.

565
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,260
I kind of liked the atmosphere and the music around Miles more than him as a character.

566
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Because, like, I don't know.

567
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,260
He was just a kid who, like, he did it, and he did the battle, and he won.

568
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
He did it.

569
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
So, you know, cool and all.

570
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
But I've seen it a lot.

571
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Yeah, good job.

572
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Good on you.

573
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
All right.

574
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
All right, look at all these fucking Marvel movies.

575
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Jesus Christ.

576
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
I haven't seen one of these things in like three years.

577
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,260
He's like, you know, Harry Potter was the boy who lived.

578
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Miles is the boy who did it.

579
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
The boy who did it.

580
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
He really done did it.

581
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Also, you know what?

582
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Why the fuck does Miles get extra spider powers that Spider-Man doesn't have?

583
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
What the hell is that about?

584
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Why can he fucking turn invisible and Spider-Man can't?

585
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
Why?

586
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
He got bit by the same fucking spider.

587
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
What the hell is the deal?

588
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
Turn invisible?

589
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Yeah.

590
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
And he has weird electroshock powers.

591
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
Why?

592
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,260
It's not necessarily the same spider, right?

593
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,260
I was going to say, was it literally the same spider?

594
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
It looked the same.

595
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
I guess I just assumed.

596
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Okay, if it's not, then fair enough.

597
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
You don't fucking know.

598
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
All right.

599
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Okay, enough.

600
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,260
You didn't get your master's degree in spider-onomy like I did.

601
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
That's fair.

602
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
What's that made?

603
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,260
It's something probably no one has ever heard, or at least not many people.

604
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
It's not a movie.

605
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,260
It's a TV series that I sort of binge-watched the first season of.

606
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,260
It's called Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.

607
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,260
I've heard of it.

608
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
I've never seen it.

609
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
I read the books, actually.

610
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Oh, okay.

611
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,260
I've been wanting to watch that show because it was directed by Max Landis.

612
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Oh, shit.

613
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
What a good movie.

614
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
He's a YouTuber.

615
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Isn't he getting me-tued now?

616
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Did he get me-tued?

617
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I mean, he's been getting me-tued his whole career, I think, or something.

618
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Only a little bit, and it didn't stick, or something like that.

619
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
I don't know.

620
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Maybe there's more to it.

621
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,260
No, he's just done a bunch of videos about how he just gets accused of really random shit.

622
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,260
There's lots of rumors and weird stuff about him because he talked shit about the girl from Star Wars,

623
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,260
and now everybody thinks he's an anti-feminist or something.

624
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
Oh, yeah.

625
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
I remember that.

626
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Oh, Mage.

627
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,260
I don't know if you know this, but Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is a series of books

628
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
by the guy-

629
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,260
Who made the-

630
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,260
by Douglas Adams.

631
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,260
Oh, I didn't know that.

633
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Yeah, the guy who did-which is why I read them.

634
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
I didn't know there was a show.

635
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Well, there's two seasons.

636
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I think they cancelled after the two seasons.

637
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,260
As my friend-because I heard this from my friend, and my friend said,

638
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Oh, they cancelled it because they wanted to invest into a different series,

639
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,260
despite the fact that Dirk Gently was doing well, but not well enough,

640
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,260
and they thought the other series would do better, but it kind of really flopped, so.

641
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
Yeah.

642
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Which is a shame.

643
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
I really liked it.

644
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,260
It was so weird, but like, I like that kind of weird, and it's-

645
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
I couldn't-I couldn't figure it out.

646
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Up until the very end, I couldn't figure everything out,

647
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,260
but like, it all came together and it's very wacky, and I like it.

648
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,260
So I-so I loved Hitchhiker's Guide as a kid.

649
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,260
To be honest, I don't remember that much about Dirk Gently.

650
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,260
The one thing I think-I think I remember about Dirk Gently,

651
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,260
or it might have been from like, his final book of like, unfinished stories

652
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,260
that might have included some Dirk Gently, like, sample chapters, was like,

653
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,260
a guy, like, a character in one of the stories is a literal rain god,

654
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
but he doesn't know that he's a rain god.

655
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Cool.

656
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,260
And so it's always raining wherever he goes, and he hates-and he hates the rain.

657
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,260
It's like, cause it-it follows him everywhere, and he doesn't know why,

658
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
and he's really depressed about it.

659
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Um, yeah.

660
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260
That's unfortunate.

661
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I think-I think Jesse-I think Jesse designed a pony OC at one point,

662
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,260
that we were gonna-we were maybe talking about doing like, an ask blog,

663
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
and it was like-

664
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
I sort of remember, I think.

665
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,260
He was like a black pony with like, a rain cloud cutie mark,

666
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
and his whole thing was the rain.

667
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,260
And I remember, I was-I drew him for Jesse,

668
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,260
and I was thinking about this guy from the Dirk Gently story, this-this, uh,

669
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
this rain dude.

670
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I don't remember-man, was that-was that OC's name?

671
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Oh!

672
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
It really liked him.

673
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Uh, Rainy Parade?

674
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Was that-

675
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Yeah, Rainy Parade. Yeah, that's it.

676
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Yeah, I remember that now.

677
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Yeah.

678
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Um, do not steal.

679
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,260
We're gonna monetize that one yet.

680
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Uh, we gotta put that on a PCP shirt.

681
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Yeah, I really like the actor for Dirk Gently.

682
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,260
He just-he-he's really good at the whole being whimsical and innocent sort of guy,

683
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,260
and then when he cries, he just looks so-so convincingly sad,

684
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,260
like, innocently sad, and just so feel bad for him.

685
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
He's a really good actor already.

686
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Was-was-is that a new series, or how old is it?

687
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
It's only from, like, a year and a half ago, two years ago.

688
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
What?

689
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,260
This is why Max Landis hasn't been doing YouTube videos,

690
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
is because he went to work on that show.

691
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Oh.

692
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
No shit.

693
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Yeah.

694
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
Which I'm wondering, what did the fuck-

695
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Well, blow me down.

696
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Now that the show's canceled.

697
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Uh, getting me-tuned, you know.

698
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Yeah.

699
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
It's just, uh, that's his full-time job.

700
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Hey guys, just got back from a hard day of getting me-tuned.

701
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,260
It's time for a little Q&A.

702
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I think we either ended, like, at the beginning of this year,

703
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
or at the ending of last year, so we'll turn this.

704
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
Uh, when are we all gonna get me-tuned?

705
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
When is my turn?

706
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Um...

707
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,260
When do-when do me, too, get what is coming to me?

708
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
You know?

709
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
I want my turn.

710
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
Are you saying that, like, the dad joke way?

711
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
That, like, uh, uh, I want some of that me-too.

712
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Like, how about me-too, get over here,

713
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,260
big, hip, waitress at my local pub?

714
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Uh, no.

715
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
No, okay.

716
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
It's not what I meant, I just meant when is each of us

717
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,260
going to have our sexual misconduct come to light?

718
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,260
I mean, reveal just the sick people that we are.

719
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,260
Taken for granted that there is misconduct.

720
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
It's only a question of when.

721
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Look, none of us-I can't believe none of us are deplatformed yet.

722
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,260
None of us have, like, a riot following us around at all times.

723
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Like, where's our-

724
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,260
We're probably doing something wrong.

725
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
What about me?

726
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
What about me?

727
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
What about me?

728
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Like...

729
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Did she-

730
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Yeah?

731
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Never mind.

732
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
Never mind.

733
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Not to give-not to give anyone ideas.

734
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
We're probably doing something wrong.

735
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Yeah.

736
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Uh, if-that we don't have that.

737
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
We're gonna have to go-

738
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Well, yeah, I-I was just gonna say,

739
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,260
not to give anyone ideas, but I sincerely believe

740
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,260
you just need to create, like, a shitstorm,

741
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
whether-where-where there-like,

742
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
people just assume where there's smoke, there's fire.

743
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
So if a lot of people just mass-report,

744
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
like, you could absolutely organize a campaign

745
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
to just report the PCP.

746
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
For, like, the joke I made before,

747
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,260
uh, about, like, you know, not liking Black Spider-Man

748
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,260
is more than enough to get this whole fucking show shut down.

749
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
If people just choose to make an issue of it.

750
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
But can we not, though?

751
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Can we just-

752
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
But-but-but all-mage, all they have to do

753
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
is be like, well, these guys have said

754
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
the N-word on this podcast before.

755
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
Oh, my God.

756
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Can you believe?

757
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
There's a pattern emerging here.

758
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
There's a pattern of behavior.

759
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
I know.

760
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
I know.

761
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
And your guys are giving me anxiety

762
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
every time you make an off-color joke.

763
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
So if we get kicked off the platform,

764
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,260
then our fucking Patreon will spike.

765
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
Well, that's true, for a time.

766
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
We need this drama.

767
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
No publicity is bad publicity.

768
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
I've been saying it for years.

769
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Yeah.

770
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
That we need to start beef.

771
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
We need to start beef.

772
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Look, everybody-

773
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I've had an ostrich and hide my head.

774
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,260
Everybody likes to-

775
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
I just don't actually do that, but-

776
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Look, everybody likes having the comfort

777
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,260
of not having controversy surrounding you.

778
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
However, you've got to leave your comfort zone

779
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
if you want to accomplish anything in this world.

780
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
You know?

781
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
You get what you want just by sitting around waiting.

782
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,260
I still don't believe the drama is necessarily

783
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
the way to do that, but-

784
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Drama is something to talk about.

785
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,260
And you've got to have people talking about you

786
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
for whatever one reason or another.

787
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
That's true.

788
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
I can steal my art.

789
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Thank you very much.

790
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
I don't want more drama.

791
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Fair enough.

792
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Fair enough.

793
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Hey, here's an interesting concept.

794
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
You know what?

795
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Okay, I'll say it because I already brought it up,

796
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
but it's just a small thing.

797
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I put in my Goblin Slayer video that came out

798
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
a week ago or whatever.

799
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
I put what I thought was official art

800
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
because I recognized this picture of guts.

801
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
I was talking about guts.

802
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
And then, as it turned out,

803
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
it was actually not official art.

804
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
What it was was-

805
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Like, a guy messages me,

806
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
and I've added this to the description, so it's fixed.

807
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
But what he said was,

808
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
hey, that's actually my art.

809
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
You please credit me.

810
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
And I was like, oh, sorry.

811
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
I thought it was official.

812
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Turns out what it was was-

813
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
it looks like a tracing.

814
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
It's not a tracing.

815
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
It is a, according to this guy,

816
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
it's a hand-drawn recreation

817
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
from not traced,

818
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
but recreated elsewhere

819
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
in a slightly different art style.

820
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
You know what I'm talking about?

821
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Another episode where we were talking about this,

822
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
we were looking at some fan art.

823
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
That's right.

824
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
It was not traced,

825
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
but it was basically perfect duplication.

826
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,260
No, we weren't sure if it was traced or not

827
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
because it looked identical,

828
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
except it was drawn on different medium,

829
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
but the guy could have easily printed it off

830
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
and traced it.

831
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,260
They said that it wasn't traced.

832
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
And I believe that,

833
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
yeah, well, maybe you didn't literally-

834
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
maybe you did just copy it by eye,

835
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
but still you just copied it.

836
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
I had my doubts, but yeah.

837
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
That's what this guy said.

838
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
I got no problem with this guy.

839
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
It's perfectly fine if he wants to do that and shit.

840
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,260
It just makes the crediting process interesting.

841
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,260
So he recreated an official piece.

842
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
It's volume one cover of Berserk.

843
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,260
It's like a picture of guts.

844
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,260
I have a little bit less of a problem with that.

845
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260
I don't know where my morals lay.

846
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Don't ask me, don't add me.

847
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Well, did he reinterpret it?

848
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
Did he reinterpret it?

849
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,260
No, it was pretty much a one-for-one recreation.

850
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
It wasn't a different art style.

851
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,260
I don't understand defensiveness over your work

852
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
if it's like that.

853
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
And any of these people,

854
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
I mean, we've talked about this before,

855
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
I will link for credit for people

856
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
just so that they'll shut the fuck up,

857
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
but I don't think you deserve it

858
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
if you're just making fan content.

859
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Like, it's not your fucking content.

860
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
No, I don't know.

861
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Don't own the IP.

862
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
No, I think you deserve it first.

863
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
I think you deserve it first.

864
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
My fan art that I draw,

865
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm a bit more lenient when people use it

866
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,260
because it is fan art for a different thing that exists

867
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,260
so long as they don't claim it that they drew it.

868
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
But look at this.

869
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,260
I'm posting this in the gross disgusting audio links.

870
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Look at this picture of Zelda that somebody fucking did.

871
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,260
She never did this pose in the game.

872
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,260
This is a new thing that somebody made

873
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
based on a character.

874
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Yeah.

875
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
How could you say this person doesn't deserve?

876
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
Fan work deserves its own credit.

877
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,260
If I throw this picture randomly into a video,

878
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
it would be no different from me throwing

879
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
gameplay footage of the game randomly into the video.

880
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,260
And I don't credit Nintendo in the description.

881
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Like, you know, I don't see...

882
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,260
I don't understand how these people themselves

883
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,260
don't understand the paradox that's going on there.

884
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
They don't look at that and say like,

885
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
I don't own Zelda, you know.

886
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Guys, my opinion might change this or shift

887
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
or it depends on the context or whatever.

888
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
But like, the way I see it, like,

889
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
if the image is a big part of your video,

890
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,260
you should probably credit it.

891
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,260
But if it's just like there for a few seconds,

892
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
and you know, you're using a lot of images

893
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
and it's not like a centerpiece or anything...

894
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Like, it could have been any other picture of Zelda.

895
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Yeah.

896
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,260
I do think if you're going to base your whole video around it,

897
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,260
then yeah, you're doing something very tasteless.

898
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,260
You definitely deserve to be called out on it, you know.

899
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
But like, yeah, if it's just like something that's just there

900
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
and like you said, could have been any picture,

901
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,260
then it's like, again, I will give credit if they ask

902
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,260
just because, you know, whatever.

903
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I'll support the artists, you know.

904
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Because I know that's what they really want.

905
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
I know that's what's...

906
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
What is upsetting to them is they're like,

907
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
you know, I drew this piece

908
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
not that many people have seen it,

909
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,260
but you've put it in this video that has tens of thousands of views.

910
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
This is probably the most that anyone's going to see it

911
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
and they don't even know that it's me who made it.

912
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
And I understand the frustration

913
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
because like I have a...

914
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
One of my fans made an AMV

915
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,260
with the anime Kase-san and Morning Glory

916
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
set to one of my songs.

917
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,260
And that AMV somehow, some way,

918
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
has like 150,000 views,

919
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,260
which is way more than any of my music,

920
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
probably combined,

921
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,260
and they didn't link to me at all in the description.

922
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
That's pretty fucked up, guys.

923
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Yeah, that's bad.

924
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
I'm looking at it and I'm like,

925
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
well, I'm not mad.

926
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,260
I'm just like, this is such a huge missed opportunity for me.

927
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
They probably didn't even know better.

928
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
No, they didn't, because she was literally like 14.

929
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
Yeah, there you go.

930
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
But you know, I was just kind of like,

931
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,260
how could you not credit me when you know it?

932
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
It would be such a huge help to me.

933
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
I mean, in that case,

934
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,260
if it's an AMV,

935
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,260
the music is like core to this.

936
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
It's foundational, absolutely.

937
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Yeah.

938
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
I was trying to say though,

939
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
if an artist does come up and be like,

940
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
hey, could you at least credit me?

941
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,260
I think it's just, you know,

942
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
common matters to just credit them if you,

943
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
you know, you did actually use their art.

944
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
You know what I've noticed though?

945
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
This has long confounded me.

946
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
I like PewDiePie, he's a good guy.

947
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
I've noticed he will credit things in videos.

948
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Now we're getting deep platforms.

949
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Yeah, it's over, we're fighting the king now.

950
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
It's just that I notice, I have a different stance.

951
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
I didn't credit tons of the stuff

952
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
that goes into his videos.

953
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
I have noticed this.

954
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
And like, yes, it's legal.

955
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I feel like it's just like kind of rude.

956
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Like, it's fair to be like,

957
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
just throw some fucking links in the description, dog.

958
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I mean, he must have an editor, right?

959
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Yeah, he's got a team of editors.

960
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
He's got a team of editors to put his videos together.

961
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Yeah, I mean, he's got at least two editors,

962
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
and I think like they, on rotation,

963
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260
they just like are given an edit,

964
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,260
like a video of like two edit and stuff.

965
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
They should be part of their job, I would think.

966
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
I just think, you know,

967
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
like, okay, to share PewDiePie

968
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
is like a really big, popular guy,

969
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
and like just getting your image in there

970
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
is good and all that.

971
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
But still though, like,

972
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
people have gotten mad at me,

973
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
and I think it's warranted when I use their stuff

974
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,260
and just don't credit them if I'm using it for something.

975
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
And so now I've adopted a policy where I do.

976
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
And when I just see like the big boys

977
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
not doing that, I just think the same,

978
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
you know, credit system should apply.

979
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Maybe they just need a poke,

980
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
but it's kind of hard to poke someone that big

981
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
and out of reach, you know what I mean?

982
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
Like, I mean, because I'm getting notifications

983
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
from people saying like, hey, would you mind

984
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
crediting me, but I never see this stuff

985
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
like being added or updated,

986
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I mean, I haven't done an exhaustive fucking search or anything.

987
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Like to his discretion, is it just that,

988
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I wonder if there's a layer of protection

989
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
that people accept that like this guy's so big

990
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
and probably gets so many pings

991
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
he can't possibly address any of them

992
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
and like worry about

993
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
crediting people.

994
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I don't know.

995
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I think probably people are asking him for credit

996
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
and just not getting a response.

997
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

998
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
But like, is it an appropriate defense

999
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
that he just gets so many messages

1000
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
that it's not his responsibility?

1001
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I mean, he's committing so many crimes

1002
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
he can't possibly correct them all.

1003
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I mean, it's a small thing.

1004
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Yeah, I think in that case, it literally is just like,

1005
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I mean, it just goes to show you

1006
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
how little it really matters to anybody

1007
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
that like it matters to that artist.

1008
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
It's not going to help them pay your fucking bills.

1009
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Yeah, I mean, it's just like not something

1010
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
that most people are worried about

1011
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260
or something that's going to affect the creator

1012
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
if they don't credit you.

1013
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
It's not like they're going to get a fucking huge backlash

1014
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
unless they've like really

1015
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
egregiously stolen something

1016
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
and like that is the basis of their content

1017
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
that they're putting.

1018
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I guess a moral thing,

1019
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,260
I just want people

1020
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
who helped me make a video

1021
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
producing something,

1022
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,260
they just deserve something in return.

1023
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
That's all I guess.

1024
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
And I guess just being in a video,

1025
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
sure, that's nice in itself.

1026
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
And if you're PewDiePie getting your thing in there,

1027
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
that's great, but I don't know.

1028
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I'd like to see more.

1029
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
I'd like to see a little bit more here.

1030
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
You fucking get PewDiePie

1031
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
to throw your fucking

1032
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Gumball Rule 34

1033
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
shit up on screen

1034
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
for two seconds and you're made

1035
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
for thousands, you're set for life.

1036
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
I mean, I guess what I would do

1037
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
The man just shits gold.

1038
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
The man's like Tyrion Lannister.

1039
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
I guess what I would do is what everybody else does

1040
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
and tweets out the video

1041
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
and say like, I'm in this video

1042
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,260
because it's a PewDiePie video and gets millions of views.

1043
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
So that's pretty cool.

1044
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
You get a little boost.

1045
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
You get a nice boost from that.

1046
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1047
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Alright, whatever. It's fine. Not a big deal.

1048
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
God, I wish I could be in a PewDiePie video.

1049
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
But you know what? My friends

1050
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Monkey's been in there, you know?

1051
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
That's true.

1052
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,260
My boy, well for bad reasons

1053
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
but my boy AFY

1054
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
had his dancing

1055
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
lolly-titty

1056
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
dancing crab meme video

1057
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
showcased in a fucking PewDiePie video.

1058
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Dancing lolly-titty

1059
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Yeah, that's what it is.

1060
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Bizarre story.

1061
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
I don't think this doesn't

1062
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
know what to make of it. I guess it's just a weird coincidence

1063
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
or something.

1064
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
So there's this

1065
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
fucking lefty

1066
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
ass

1067
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
blue pill

1068
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,260
who is my hero

1069
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,260
is

1070
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
a YouTuber

1071
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
called Jack St

1072
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
or Lacking St.

1073
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Do you just like him because of the name?

1074
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
That's why I clicked on him

1075
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
originally.

1076
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
So he

1077
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
made a video

1078
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
maybe a couple months ago

1079
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
called The Story of Ascentar

1080
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
a neo-liberal horror story

1081
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
and in it he relates

1082
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,260
a news story

1083
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
or he goes into the story of how

1084
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,260
an internet company

1085
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
their equipment was faulty

1086
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
and it started creating a

1087
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
loud wine, a high-pitched wine

1088
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,260
and people in the neighborhood

1089
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
started tweeting about it and stuff

1090
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
and people didn't

1091
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
take it seriously

1092
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,260
thought they were complaining

1093
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,260
but it went on for weeks and weeks

1094
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,260
and it created a high-stress environment

1095
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,260
and ultimately there was

1096
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,260
a violent incident

1097
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
someone pulled out a gun

1098
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
and tried to shoot out the transformer

1099
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
that was producing the noise

1100
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
and someone thought he was being shot at

1101
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
and pulled out a gun and shot back

1102
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
and someone got killed

1103
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
so anyway

1104
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
that's a crazy story

1105
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
and meanwhile

1106
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,260
the rich fat cats running the internet provider

1107
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
just sit back and do nothing

1108
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
they barely even apologize for the incident

1109
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
shame on them

1110
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
so a new video comes out by this guy

1111
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
and he explains that in fact

1112
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
this was a work of fiction

1113
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260
that he had written

1114
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,260
but delivered sort of as fact

1115
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,260
there were some hints in it that it was not true

1116
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,260
but I had not picked up on them

1117
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,260
I had thought this was a real thing that happened

1118
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,260
kind of like real information might be

1119
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,260
and he

1120
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
compared it to like

1121
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Orson Welles war of the worlds

1122
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
type of like

1123
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
like a documentary style

1124
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
like a work of fiction delivered

1125
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,260
like a documentary as though it were true events

1126
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
whatever the point is

1127
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
that in that video

1128
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
he goes to google

1129
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
it should have been pretty clear

1130
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
to anyone who wanted to know more

1131
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,260
that this was not a real event because there's no

1132
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
google search results about it

1133
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
and he goes on youtube and google search

1134
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
is like a sentar incident

1135
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,260
and to demonstrate

1136
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
that there are no results however

1137
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,260
one of the top

1138
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
results from that search

1139
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
is a thumbnail of like one of

1140
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
mumkey's videos

1141
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
like one of the last videos that he posted

1142
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
and I was like I pause the video and I was like wait is that

1143
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
why would that come up

1144
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
in that search?

1145
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
a sento I mean it's possible

1146
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260
it's recommended for this guy who's making the video

1147
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
that he's just a fan and that happens to be

1148
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
maybe

1149
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,260
but is it the search results though right?

1150
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260
yeah

1151
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
you wouldn't think that does that

1152
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
no

1153
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,260
yeah I don't know

1154
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
that was weird

1155
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,260
oh thanks for the show notes

1156
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
showing visually demonstrating how

1157
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260
brown is n-word backwards

1158
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,260
yeah no problem well that's to remind me to get the image

1159
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
to link it

1160
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,260
to breaking

1161
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
right

1162
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
but that's a good video

1163
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,260
the ascentar video by Jackson

1164
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,260
is pretty good

1165
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,260
kind of like it less now that I know it's not real

1166
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
yeah it made me question everything

1167
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,260
I mean is there something

1168
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
slightly unethical about doing that

1169
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,260
telling a story and presenting it as fact

1170
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,260
I mean I feel a little

1171
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,260
I feel a little bit embarrassed

1172
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,260
trying to be like oh you know I was lied to

1173
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,260
because like I feel a little bit like

1174
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
I don't want to point out that the emperor has no clothes

1175
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,260
because I'll be revealed

1176
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,260
as the rube that I am that I was tricked

1177
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
but I don't know

1178
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,260
I'm a pretty canny viewer of media

1179
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,260
I went into this video

1180
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,260
feeling like I had no reason

1181
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,260
not to assume

1182
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,260
that the facts being related to me were true

1183
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,260
mm-hmm

1184
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
uh

1185
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,260
kind of reminds me of the whole marble hornet thing

1186
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,260
though you kind of knew it was not true

1187
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
but they were very dedicated

1188
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,260
well

1189
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,260
I mean I wasn't I wasn't around

1190
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,260
when marble hornets was new

1191
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,260
but I assume that no one was really watching

1192
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,260
marble hornets until

1193
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,260
it became clear that it was

1194
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,260
a slender man thing

1195
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,260
and by that point it probably should have been clear that no

1196
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
this is not real

1197
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,260
that's right

1198
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,260
that's my assumption I don't even know what fucking marble hornets is

1199
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,260
they've explained to me like ten times I still don't understand

1200
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,260
it's the slender man

1201
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,260
video

1202
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
I don't know

1203
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,260
what's happening

1204
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
what's a video on youtube

1205
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
what is youtube

1206
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,260
we need to start in round zero

1207
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,260
where is web 2.0

1208
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,260
um

1209
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,260
I get all my youtube videos through

1210
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,260
a youtube amalgamation website

1211
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,260
where I never need to touch youtube

1212
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,260
they're just fed directly into my brain

1213
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
how about a web 4.0 now

1214
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,260
how about a web 2.0

1215
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,260
how about a web 2.0

1216
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,260
how about a web 4.0 now

1217
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,260
I need a fucking jewel

1218
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,260
I need a fucking jewel after all this

1219
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,260
I need to calm my nerves

1220
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,260
I only watch the

1221
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,260
current top video on all of reddit

1222
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
it is the only content

1223
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,260
I will consume

1224
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,260
you know what would be a fascinating video

1225
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,260
an analysis of the top content

1226
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
on I guess all of reddit

1227
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,260
like overtime if such a thing can be tracked

1228
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
or I guess just like on youtube

1229
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,260
or wherever just like whatever was

1230
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
the most mass appeal

1231
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
thing it was that history of dance video

1232
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,260
fuck you know what I think I've seen some of this

1233
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
actually and I think about it

1234
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,260
I was thinking

1235
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
I don't remember what

1236
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,260
prompted me to think about this

1237
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
but I was thinking about like

1238
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
youtube subscriber inflation

1239
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
and like

1240
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,260
you know how in like

1241
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,260
2005 or whatever

1242
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,260
having tens of thousands

1243
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,260
of subscribers was like you know

1244
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,260
was a big deal and you could be like

1245
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,260
the front page of youtube for that

1246
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
I was wondering like

1247
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
if you could take like who were

1248
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
the top subscribe channels in those days

1249
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,260
and like take that number

1250
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
divide it into the subscribers of

1251
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,260
the top subscribe channel today

1252
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,260
would you arrive at like a rough

1253
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,260
sort of you know

1254
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
inflation rate or a rough sort of

1255
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,260
conversion rate for like

1256
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
subscribers in 2018

1257
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,260
how many subscribers would that be

1258
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,260
roughly equivalent to in you know

1259
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,260
2005 or whatever

1260
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,260
it's gotta be a huge difference I mean

1261
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,260
I don't know what that'd be but

1262
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
I remember I've seen I've seen some

1263
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,260
infographics of like you know the top

1264
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,260
the top youtube channel and like how

1265
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,260
they've all you know

1266
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,260
grown how the numbers have gone up

1267
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,260
and up and up and they've all like you know

1268
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,260
zigged and zagged and surpassed

1269
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,260
each other and back again like h

1270
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,260
no not h3h3 less

1271
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,260
equals 3 equals 3 was was top

1272
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,260
for a while

1273
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,260
I've never even heard of that

1274
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,260
never heard of equals 3

1275
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
I remember him

1276
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
oh god

1277
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
nostalgia

1278
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,260
I did not I did not I did not watch him

1279
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,260
back in the day I didn't know who he was until

1280
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
relatively

1281
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,260
I remember when people were just

1282
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
the

1283
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,260
squirrel aids was funny apparently I never

1284
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,260
found it funny but it was just

1285
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,260
a joke

1286
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
I did see some of his

1287
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,260
you know music videos

1288
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,260
I didn't know who they were

1289
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,260
your mom

1290
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,260
yeah I had I had seen

1291
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,260
stalking your mom years and years ago

1292
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,260
never knowing it had anything to do with

1293
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,260
this ray william johnson I think the

1294
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,260
general was titled doing your mom but then

1295
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
they made it you know they remade it

1296
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,260
they remade it I think

1297
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,260
I mean in ray william

1298
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,260
justin I think the end

1299
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,260
or something like they had

1300
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,260
a bit of a theme song that it was called

1301
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,260
doing your mom but I'm not sure if it was by

1302
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,260
them or anything so is that guy just not

1303
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
around anymore what happened

1304
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,260
what happened to ray william johnson

1305
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,260
because I remember people complaining about him all the time

1306
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,260
he was the guy who actually think I

1307
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,260
that same guy that that jack saint guy

1308
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,260
did a video about

1309
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,260
ray william johnson I heard

1310
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,260
wasn't he the dude who just like

1311
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,260
just talk about what was popular on youtube

1312
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,260
yeah he talked about memes

1313
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,260
he would he would just like

1314
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,260
show videos that were

1315
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
popular on youtube and say

1316
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
yeah that's true that was it

1317
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,260
that was really funny

1318
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,260
he was like he was like America's funniest

1319
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
home videos but for youtube

1320
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,260
I see that there is a channel

1321
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,260
called simply ray that has

1322
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,260
9.8 million subscribers that he

1323
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,260
uploaded to one day ago

1324
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,260
and oh there was a 5 month

1325
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,260
gap here but I guess he uploads

1326
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,260
things here I don't know

1327
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,260
I think he sort of passed on his

1328
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,260
equals 3 channel to someone

1329
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,260
and that didn't do so

1330
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,260
yeah he quit it he quit it

1331
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,260
yeah it was

1332
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,260
it was jack saint that's why

1333
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,260
I was thinking about ray william johnson

1334
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,260
he did a video about that and he still

1335
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,260
uploads but like you know

1336
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,260
or no wait maybe it was

1337
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,260
maybe it was a quintin reviews maybe it was a fallen

1338
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,260
titan quintin you know what that's what it was

1339
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,260
it was a quintin reviews oh is that that one

1340
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,260
that's the bearded dude right

1341
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,260
yes that guy's pretty good

1342
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,260
I only watched like one or two of his videos

1343
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,260
but they were pretty good you know he's alright

1344
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
I've watched a bunch of his stuff

1345
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
it's pretty it's pretty deice

1346
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,260
I've been seeing a lot of like negative

1347
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,260
sentiments I was gonna say

1348
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,260
I've been seeing a lot of people saying that he

1349
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,260
he's an asshole for various reasons lately

1350
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,260
I'm not sure why well it seems like

1351
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,260
I don't trust what anybody says

1352
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,260
people say I'm an asshole constantly and

1353
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,260
they're probably right but I don't believe it anyway

1354
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,260
I don't know I don't know what

1355
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
it is but something I feel like he's made

1356
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,260
people mad I I don't know how can't

1357
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,260
I haven't watched any of his stuff but I

1358
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,260
feel that he's a trump

1359
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
hate man that people think is a little bit

1360
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
over the top is anyone not a trump

1361
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,260
hate man

1362
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
orange man bad

1363
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
orange man bad

1364
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
orange man bad

1365
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,260
that was a

1366
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,260
yeah that was a god that was another there was

1367
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,260
jack saint did a video on the NPC

1368
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,260
meme and

1369
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,260
talking about orange man bad

1370
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
that's how I know about

1371
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,260
orange man bad

1372
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,260
I've never heard that before

1373
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
I'm surprised

1374
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
it's kind of a meme by now

1375
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,260
it's pretty funny

1376
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
I saw a good counter post I saw a tweet or something

1377
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,260
there's a picture of someone posted the NPC

1378
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,260
orange man bad and then someone

1379
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,260
posted a pet posted back a

1380
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,260
pepe with the NPC face

1381
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,260
saying orange man good so you see

1382
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,260
the knife cuts both ways

1383
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,260
oh no

1384
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,260
now that we've unleashed the monster

1385
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,260
he'll slaughter us all both sides

1386
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,260
well

1387
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,260
all man bad

1388
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,260
oh no

1389
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,260
hey guys to sort of

1390
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,260
change the subject and maybe

1391
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
wrap it back to the holiday season

1392
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,260
it's not new years yet

1393
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,260
it is going to be when people are

1394
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,260
you know after new years when people are

1395
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,260
going to listen to it but what are your

1396
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,260
new year

1397
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,260
plans any resolutions

1398
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,260
whatever

1399
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
I don't really do resolutions

1400
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
you know

1401
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,260
I mean

1402
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,260
I'm getting

1403
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,260
I have lately been getting back to

1404
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
drawing the vapors finally

1405
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,260
so I guess my resolution is to

1406
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,260
continue that

1407
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,260
I'm sure you'll appreciate this

1408
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
Nate but my new years resolution

1409
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,260
for next year is to

1410
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,260
just kick ass all year

1411
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
excellent

1412
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,260
normally

1413
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,260
I have a more concrete goal

1414
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,260
last year it was to make $100,000

1415
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,260
I don't think I did accomplish that

1416
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,260
but

1417
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,260
ordinarily I would just make it the

1418
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,260
same goal again shoot for the moon

1419
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,260
Digi even if you miss you still

1420
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,260
land among the stars

1421
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
I think that what I really

1422
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,260
want next year is not so much about

1423
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
how much money I make but how much

1424
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,260
progress I make

1425
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,260
if you're just fixated

1426
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,260
on like multiplying how much

1427
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,260
money you make in a linear way

1428
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,260
there's no sense of build up

1429
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,260
an investment for like being able

1430
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,260
to make more in the future

1431
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,260
it's not so much about

1432
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,260
that I want in the next year to get

1433
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,260
to a point where I'm making $100,000

1434
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,260
as it is to have set

1435
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,260
everything up that I can

1436
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,260
you know move

1437
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,260
even faster going forward

1438
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,260
this is too vague to be good radio

1439
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,260
talk but you know what I'm talking about

1440
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,260
I get the general idea

1441
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,260
my general commitment

1442
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,260
goal whatever

1443
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
it's really just to buckle down

1444
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,260
I was really hoping

1445
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,260
to get this ghost in the shell video

1446
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
I've been working on out

1447
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,260
before the end of the year that did not happen

1448
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,260
so just I want to get all my commitments

1449
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,260
out of the way this year

1450
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,260
which essentially is

1451
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,260
there's a little bit of rad con stuff left

1452
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,260
I mean this honestly that's too small

1453
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,260
of a goal for the whole year because it's going to be done fairly quickly

1454
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,260
but I have really cleared

1455
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
the field and I'm not going to be taking

1456
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,260
on any more burdens and like

1457
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
I've got my first we Agua out now that I'm back on them

1458
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,260
I'm really trying to stick to a schedule

1459
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,260
of at least every other week or so

1460
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,260
and using that opposite week

1461
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,260
to like get other stuff done and I know

1462
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
I say it a lot but frankly the finances are looking

1463
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,260
good and I creep ever closer

1464
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,260
towards this being

1465
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,260
released from the day job thing so

1466
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,260
we'll see

1467
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,260
when are you coming to fucking Boston

1468
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
we were talking about

1469
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,260
I got to check the dates I think we were planning

1470
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
people there's a little inside baseball we were planning

1471
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,260
to get together sometime

1472
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,260
in the next couple of weeks I think around the 13th

1473
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,260
if I remember correctly

1474
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,260
and do some planning for

1475
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,260
PCP stuff and communal projects

1476
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,260
and do some workshop

1477
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,260
I need there's a lot that needs to be

1478
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,260
discussed about the possibilities

1479
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,260
and requirements

1480
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,260
that we will have to meet

1481
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,260
in order to be able to fucking

1482
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,260
make PCPHQ real

1483
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,260
yep and those are substantial

1484
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,260
and we need a solid plan so yeah

1485
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,260
yeah I'm down

1486
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,260
I've been listening to what you've been saying in our

1487
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,260
private things and yeah

1488
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,260
that's right audience we're out here

1489
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,260
making plans we're out here moving

1490
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,260
moving money around

1491
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,260
moving and shaking

1492
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,260
shaking and bacon and taking

1493
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,260
lots of big

1494
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,260
hits on the bong

1495
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,260
for inspiration

1496
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,260
if only

1497
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,260
Ben I might need you to

1498
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,260
didn't you say that you knew a guy who could get me weed

1499
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,260
don't

1500
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,260
don't say it

1501
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,260
don't say it on the podcast

1502
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,260
don't let them know

1503
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,260
the Christians will know

1504
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,260
don't let them know

1505
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
well now they know

1506
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
let it go let it go

1507
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,260
it's cold outside

1508
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,260
nobody else smokes but weed

1509
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,260
is literally legal now here in Boston

1510
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
or in Massachusetts

1511
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,260
you can literally just go buy it and it's too fucking expensive

1512
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,260
I thought

1513
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,260
it's literally

1514
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,260
420 an ounce

1515
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,260
straight up

1516
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,260
they did it

1517
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,260
$420 an ounce

1518
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,260
oh I thought you meant $4.20

1519
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,260
I was like that's not so bad

1520
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,260
that reminds me I think recently in Canada

1521
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,260
or at least Vancouver

1522
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,260
legalized weed and stuff

1523
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,260
and when I visited Canada

1524
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,260
it smelled

1525
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,260
everywhere

1526
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,260
that's fucking great

1527
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,260
I was told that they don't have

1528
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,260
any sort of official

1529
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,260
places they sell

1530
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,260
so they're still buying it from illegal places

1531
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,260
despite it being legalized

1532
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,260
so it's kind of a weird situation

1533
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,260
to be in I guess

1534
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,260
did I ever tell you

1535
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,260
when I was in Amsterdam

1536
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,260
you smoke weed

1537
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
I don't really smoke weed

1538
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,260
in Amsterdam you smoke weed that is what you do

1539
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
so I was like

1540
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,260
I guess I should smoke some weed

1541
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,260
so I got some weed

1542
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,260
they have bars

1543
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,260
you can just go into a bar

1544
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,260
and buy a joint at the bar

1545
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,260
nice

1546
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,260
so I got one and I went outside

1547
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,260
and I was walking around smoking it

1548
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,260
and people were like you can't smoke that outside

1549
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
and I was like what the fuck man

1550
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,260
when I went to Japan

1551
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
I turned 21 but the drink age there

1552
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,260
is 20 so I could drink before

1553
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
in Japan, in Tokyo at least

1554
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,260
you can just drink on the street

1555
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,260
you can just walk wherever you want

1556
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,260
in America you can't fucking do that

1557
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,260
in Europe you can

1558
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,260
buy a beer and walk home

1559
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,260
drinking your beer

1560
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,260
you can't do it anywhere in America

1561
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,260
nowhere in America can you do that as far as I know

1562
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,260
the best they got

1563
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,260
is some restaurants

1564
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,260
they might have

1565
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
an outdoor

1566
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,260
that's pretty common

1567
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,260
what the fuck man

1568
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,260
but yeah

1569
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,260
Digi

1570
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,260
I live with a bunch of guys that smoke weed

1571
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,260
one guy

1572
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,260
the guy

1573
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,260
I won't say his name

1574
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,260
it doesn't matter

1575
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,260
I asked him where he got his

1576
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,260
and he was like oh my friends sell it

1577
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,260
but they're not looking to deal

1578
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,260
with buyers or anything so that was a bust

1579
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,260
but then a new guy moved in

1580
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,260
and I asked him if he had a hookup

1581
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,260
and he said yeah so I was like

1582
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,260
yeah new guy

1583
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,260
yeah new guy

1584
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,260
I'm not sure what the prices are out on the streets

1585
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,260
currently but it's gotta be cheaper than

1586
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
the fucking official shit

1587
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,260
I am shocked by that price

1588
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,260
he didn't quote me

1589
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,260
he wouldn't quote me like a specific price

1590
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
but I'm sure it's less than what you're paying

1591
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,260
is it bureaucracy and government overhead

1592
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,260
that made the price so high

1593
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,260
it's just straight taxes

1594
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,260
it's just like a 20% fucking tax

1595
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,260
because that's what tax included

1596
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
it's 4.29

1597
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
so like when we did Radcom 3

1598
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
Kickstarter we went to 9001

1599
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,260
for the meme

1600
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,260
and that was a

1601
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,260
complete joke

1602
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,260
but we were doing it

1603
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,260
we reached it

1604
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,260
so that's all cool

1605
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,260
what degree they went up to

1606
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,260
versus what it would have been

1607
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,260
if not just for the meme

1608
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,260
apparently in all the places that they've

1609
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,260
legalized weed

1610
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,260
the prices always start off really high

1611
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,260
and then they quickly go down

1612
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,260
over the course of the first year or two

1613
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,260
because of the fact that

1614
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,260
it just shouldn't cost that much

1615
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,260
and more people can afford it

1616
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,260
so the places that are selling it right now

1617
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,260
are all very high end

1618
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,260
fancy places

1619
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,260
they're all former medical dispensaries

1620
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,260
we need a place for gutter sluts

1621
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,260
such as ourselves

1622
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,260
the proletariat needs weed

1623
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,260
more than the rich do

1624
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,260
yeah they got their zany anyway

1625
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,260
exactly

1626
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,260
give them their fucking

1627
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,260
I smell benes

1628
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,260
wait

1629
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
what is the connection with

1630
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,260
I'm very familiar with that meme

1631
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
and I love it and quote it all the time

1632
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,260
but what's the connection here

1633
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,260
aren't benes benedral

1634
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,260
which is a fucking meme

1635
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,260
that I've

1636
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,260
I thought the meme was I smell benes

1637
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,260
the guy says

1638
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,260
I finally got all these benes

1639
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,260
maybe it was like

1640
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,260
it's gotta be benzos

1641
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,260
whatever that's short for

1642
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,260
that's an actual drug

1643
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,260
does anyone take benedral to get high

1644
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,260
they might

1645
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,260
isn't that what benzos are as well

1646
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,260
you know it could be

1647
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,260
and I wouldn't know

1648
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,260
we need to know people

1649
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
hey what do you say we do the voicemails

1650
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,260
now how about

1651
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,260
I mean we've only been going for an hour

1652
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,260
yeah I mean I don't know

1653
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,260
that's true

1654
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,260
I'm happy to take you guys

1655
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,260
have anything else you want to talk about that's fine with me

1656
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,260
I mean like the voicemails

1657
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,260
depending on what we're asked

1658
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,260
or presented

1659
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,260
you could also ask up to an hour who knows

1660
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
yeah that's true

1661
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
yeah okay let's do a voicemail

1662
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,260
here's our first one

1663
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,260
apparently it's a slang term for the drug

1664
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,260
benzadrine

1665
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,260
benzos

1666
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,260
I guess it's all the same shit

1667
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,260
I'm looking at something right now

1668
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,260
do you guys know that endless war

1669
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,260
has territory control now

1670
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,260
I've heard about this haven't looked into it but I'm aware

1671
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,260
have you seen the new map

1672
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,260
no I haven't

1673
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,260
I'm just gonna post a link to the map

1674
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
which is dynamic and which now like updates itself

1675
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,260
to show like what

1676
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,260
it's so I'm looking at it right now

1677
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,260
and I just can't I'm just it's

1678
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,260
it's crack fucking did it

1679
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,260
we the team the team did it

1680
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
pulled together looks exactly like it always

1681
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,260
looked in my head

1682
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
this is

1683
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
cause this is where Nate posted

1684
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,260
this is where we put the links

1685
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,260
so that the people who are editing

1686
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,260
can easily just use them

1687
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,260
once they're it's time to edit

1688
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,260
it makes it real easy for everybody

1689
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,260
okay fine

1690
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,260
the fucking the juvie's control

1691
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,260
cratersville what the hell is that about

1692
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,260
no no that's green is neutral

1693
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,260
okay okay well this looks dope

1694
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,260
I see the killers are dominating that's excellent

1695
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,260
it

1696
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,260
it moves pretty fast

1697
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,260
the killers are I think the killers

1698
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,260
have a stronger strategic position

1699
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
cop kill town but

1700
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,260
to help that we're gonna

1701
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,260
we're gonna put in a ferry we're gonna add a ferry

1702
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,260
from cratersville to

1703
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,260
assault flat speech resort

1704
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,260
and as well

1705
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,260
just break it down for me real quick

1706
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,260
what is the general way the territory

1707
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,260
is passed because I've been wondering

1708
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,260
how does one control an area

1709
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,260
you know once you could explain it better

1710
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,260
because I was working on slimoids while he

1711
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,260
and right and

1712
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,260
and and be and we were

1713
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,260
not do we don't think

1714
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,260
mostly Munchie and lateralist

1715
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,260
were most I think mostly lateralist

1716
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,260
honestly we're working on territory control

1717
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,260
so I don't know the ins and outs of it but I believe

1718
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,260
mm-hmm the gist of it

1719
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,260
is that you just have to go to

1720
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,260
a place and just basically be

1721
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,260
there you just have to spend time in a zone

1722
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,260
okay and while you're there

1723
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,260
you will be uncapturing it from the other

1724
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,260
team making it neutral and then you will

1725
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,260
start capturing I see for your only other

1726
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,260
question what are the benefits of having

1727
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,260
captured a zone I

1728
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,260
believe right now the only benefit

1729
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,260
is that they pass passively

1730
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,260
generate slime for your kingpin

1731
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,260
okay cool cool yeah

1732
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,260
so they're forgetting your team ahead

1733
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,260
I want to play slime rancher now

1734
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,260
slime rancher is sick

1735
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,260
I wish so bad that

1736
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,260
slime rancher had multiple same

1737
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,260
same so much I got I got my boyfriend

1738
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,260

1739
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,260
and I just I really wish we could play together

1740
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,260
yeah

1741
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,260
I would man

1742
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,260
and what if we had like a team what if the three

1743
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,260

1783
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,260
I don't know if you guys are aware

1784
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,260
but there has been official war

1785
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,260
declared the only reason

1786
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,260
the only reason that the

1787
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,260
endless war people were able to

1788
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,260
even have a foothold in the I am game

1789
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,260
servers because tom foolishly

1790
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,260
declared war while his co-leader

1791
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,260
was completely away on vacation

1792
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,260
and I had

1793
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,260
no ability to help

1794
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,260
in any way to

1795
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,260
raise the armaments

1796
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,260
and the defenses

1797
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,260
and to retaliate

1798
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,260
I'm just saying the next battle

1799
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,260
might not go so smoothly

1800
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,260
I think that the

1801
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,260
endless war crowd

1802
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,260
was pretty well

1803
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,260
mentally primed for this

1804
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,260
I think maybe we'd been

1805
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,260
without even intending to

1806
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,260
kind of indoctrinating them

1807
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,260
for this eventuality

1808
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,260
for the waging of war

1809
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,260
in a discord server

1810
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,260
they might have had some practice

1811
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,260
that kind of thing

1812
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,260
might be like the whole conceit

1813
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,260
that's just a theory

1814
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,260
a game theory

1815
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,260
there's a

1816
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,260
my boys

1817
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,260
in the pod de escort

1818
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,260
have also on record gone on

1819
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,260
and declared war on all other

1820
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,260
servers and

1821
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,260
you know what

1822
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,260
I gotta throw this in

1823
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,260
there was something produced and while we're on the

1824
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,260
subject of the war going on between all the

1825
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,260
servers

1826
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,260
I gotta throw this in

1827
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,260
I'll play the next call and we'll get back to that

1828
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,260
I just want doopity

1829
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,260
I wish you had mentioned

1830
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,260
if they had

1831
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,260
rescued paradox crocs from the mud

1832
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,260
knights in the mud puddle

1833
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,260
there's still no

1834
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,260
update on that

1835
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,260
I forgot about the mud puddle

1836
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,260
the mud versus slime war rages on

1837
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,260
as I understand it

1838
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,260
presumably

1839
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,260
I can't see that ending

1840
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,260
that's like an Israel Palestine

1841
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,260
there's no understanding

1842
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,260
you know what

1843
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,260
everybody listen up

1844
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,260
this is the pod de declaration

1845
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,260
of war

1846
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,260
let's play it for all to hear

1847
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,260
made by AFY

1848
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,260
and center point

1849
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,260
go

1850
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,260
there once were captains named Gibb and Nate

1851
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,260
who were kings of the pirates

1852
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,260
they had riches and autism

1853
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,260
beyond your wildish

1854
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,260

PCP discord there is

1858
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,260
we're so good in fact that we're ready to

1859
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,260
start the war by dropping this

1860
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,260

that's the whole crew there

1890
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,260
I didn't even know there was a pody cast discord

1891
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,260
but of course there is

1892
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,260
I think I heard about it

1893
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,260
and they just fucking

1894
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,260
afy and centerpoint got everybody on the server

1895
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,260
together and they all fucking recorded it

1896
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,260
everyone knows now

1897
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,260
about the pody

1898
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,260
she just got real

1899
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,260
my discord is not participating in the war

1900
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,260
that's some bullshit mage

1901
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,260
it's not participating in the war

1902
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,260
Switzerland ass over there

1903
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,260
I'm not telling anyone to do anything

1904
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,260
sincerely

1905
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,260
but I'm just saying

1906
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,260
you ever heard of a little country called Poland

1907
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,260
mmhmm

1908
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,260
you ever heard of a little thing called world war 2

1909
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,260
I also heard about switzerland

1910
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,260
never heard of it

1911
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,260
little thing called blitzkrieg

1912
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,260
little thing called crystal knocked

1913
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,260
just giving you some ideas ladies and gentlemen

1914
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,260
no war is allowed

1915
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,260
we win

1916
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,260
it's over we already won this one

1917
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,260
it's gonna be so tragic

1918
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,260
what will definitely happen to you

1919
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,260
alright I'm mourning you already

1920
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,260
I made you just said

1921
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,260
you're sitting it out god damn

1922
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,260
you can't have it both ways you can't be like

1923
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,260
oh if I was fighting guys I would

1924
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,260
I said I like how you said you already won

1925
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,260
even though I'm not even playing

1926
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,260
that's sad

1927
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,260
what the hell am I supposed to do

1928
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,260
you took yourself out of it

1929
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,260
the only winning move is not to play

1930
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,260
unless you're poland in world war 2

1931
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,260
like you are

1932
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,260
poland

1933
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,260
the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter

1934
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,260
whether or not mage wants

1935
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,260
to be participating in the war

1936
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,260
when a war comes to your doorstep

1937
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,260
when the fuck are you gonna do

1938
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,260
we're gonna delete your damn discord mage

1939
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,260
we're taking it out

1940
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,260
maybe we need to ratify

1941
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,260
maybe we need to ratify like our own Geneva convention

1942
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,260
or something

1943
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,260
for the rules

1944
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,260
the rules of ethical warfare

1945
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,260
the Geneva convention was only established after world war 2

1946
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,260
I think though

1947
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,260
we'll just have to wait for mage to become a casualty

1948
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,260
and then we can look back on it

1949
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,260
with

1950
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,260
better understanding

1951
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,260
yeah but you got lots of natural resources

1952
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,260
that I'm gonna need to mine

1953
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,260
I'm gonna need to take those

1954
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,260
we're seizing those

1955
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,260
you're like um

1956
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,260
she's rich with minerals

1957
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,260
you're like rabbinaster in

1958
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,260
fucking

1959
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,260
final fantasy 12 that's right between the two gigantic

1960
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,260
empires

1961
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,260
that's not a good place to be

1962
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,260
it's like that

1963
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,260
oh god you're seeing

1964
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,260
legend of the galactic empire

1965
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,260
what's that neutral planet

1966
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,260
right in between the two

1967
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,260
mage how would one even get

1968
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,260

how do you even declare the winner anyway

2000
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,260
when everyone else's discord

2001
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,260
is deleted and they're all

2002
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,260
when everyone else is dead

2003
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,260
that's how

2004
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,260
I guess it's just

2005
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,260
when you say that you won

2006
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,260
like that guy in that last call

2007
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,260
who just said that

2008
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,260
he's won

2009
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,260
on no basis whatsoever

2010
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,260
it's like

2011
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,260
so can we stop

2012
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,260
it's like saying you're cool

2013
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,260
you just say it enough and it becomes true

2014
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,260
I'm gonna say

2015
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,260
I'm not gonna be in the war

2016
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:38,260
that's why you gotta click below

2017
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,260

2018
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,260

2020
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,260
that's the real winner here

2021
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,260
behind all it's all to funnel people

2022
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,260
to the tea spring

2023
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,260
the entire war was orchestrated so people

2024
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,260
want to be cool

2025
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,260
all the runoff from the discord war

2026
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,260
like as the bodies just

2027
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,260
drop as the body count rises

2028
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,260
all the casual teas

2029
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,260
are just spat out the sewer drain

2030
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,260
into the tea spring

2031
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,260
I've got it we don't have white flags

2032
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,260
in this war if you're waving a white flag

2033
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,260
it doesn't matter you're a participant as much as everyone else

2034
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,260
the only way to remove yourself from the discord

2035
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,260
is to buy in I'm just being

2036
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,260
cool t-shirt that's how you become

2037
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,260
exempt and that's the only way

2038
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,260
you can escape that's the way

2039
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,260
all I know is the

2040
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,260
the discord

2041
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,260

01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,260
the best one but then I realized all

2076
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,260
of the games have like a different

2077
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,260
character in the story and shit

2078
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,260

we've been getting a lot of people just like thrown in music

2093
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,260
I think I don't know I don't know if it's the same guy

2094
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,260
I presume there's a guy who

2095
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,260
will just fucking jam out a tune on the piano

2096
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,260
in voicemail

2097
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,260
there actually was a guy in the voicemail who just played

2098
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,260
a little bit of the Ava

2099
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,260
opening but it was just that

2100
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,260
so it was kind of boring so I just didn't include it

2101
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,260
but shout out to that guy

2102
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,260
guys this is a problem the voicemails

2103
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,260
are better than the actual show on this episode

2104
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,260
they're way better

2105
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,260

2106
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,260

01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,260
we'll figure something out

2108
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,260
we'll fix it in post

2109
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,260

2112
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,260
rats

2113
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,260
let's get into it go

2114
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,260
oh it's me munchie

2115
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,260
wears tiny rats

2116
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,260
and I'm going to go to art school

2117
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,260
10 minutes later

2118
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,260
oh I failed

2119
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,260
arts

2120
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,260
it's like looking into the future

2121
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,260
it's like looking in the mirror

2122
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,260
does anybody know if munchie's actually been accepted

2123
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,260
into that school yet

2124
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,260
oh he hasn't applied yet

2125
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,260
because he asked me for a letter of recommendation

2126
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,260
which I'm happily supplying

2127
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,260
oh he asked me for one too and I completely forgot about that

2128
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,260
that was like six months ago

2129
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,260
oh I've got mine ready actually

2130
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,260
what sort of authority do you have

2131
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,260
to recommend I'm just curious

2132
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,260
well I'm rich and famous

2133
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,260
I mean you know not bad

2134
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,260
munchie said

2135
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,260
you get like previous employer usually you get

2136
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,260
like previous employer

2137
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,260
I mean I have literally paid

2138
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,260
munchie a lot

2139
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,260
well not a lot because he gives me a lot of

2140
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,260
shit for free but like you know he is

2141
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,260
responsible for like the iconography

2142
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,260
of my channel

2143
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,260
many times over over the years

2144
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,260
I mean when he asked me

2145
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,260
he just said like essentially

2146
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,260
you know I'm quote unquote his boss

2147
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,260
in the PCB not really we all know that but like

2148
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,260
effectively it sort of works that way

2149
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,260
so he just thought that like I'd be a guy who could

2150
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,260
detail his strengths

2151
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,260
you know as like a member of our little group here

2152
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,260
so you know

2153
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,260
plus I've commissioned him a bunch and he's always been good so

2154
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,260
you know

2155
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,260
speaking of commissions my commissions are always open

2156
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,260
oh yeah always

2157
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,260
yeah that's cool

2158
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,260
until I stayed in other ways

2159
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,260
munchie got uh munchie announced

2160
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,260
he announced open commissions recently

2161
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,260
and apparently he got flooded

2162
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,260
yeah and actually uh

2163
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,260
he told me what he was charging though

2164
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,260
and I was like that's pretty low

2165
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,260
balls I think that's kind of the reason that I

2166
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,260
that I had been saying that like it was surprising

2167
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,260
to me that he wanted to go

2168
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,260
to school is that he can work so

2169
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,260
fucking fast that like yeah he can do

2170
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:02,260
commissions that are like 15 bucks and he'll

2171
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,260
jam you out of picture in like half an hour that you're

2172
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,260
completely satisfied with you know

2173
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,260
so 15 bucks for half an hour of work is

2174
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,260
extremely fucking good you know that's true

2175
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,260
I mean

2176
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,260
I don't think commissions is that

2177
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,260
like he's got higher aspirates unless

2178
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,260
you're like really famous and

2179
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,260
personally I just hate doing commissions

2180
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,260
I think munchie is less anti

2181
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,260
I hate drawing commissions

2182
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,260
munchie seems to like doing it

2183
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,260
I used to not like doing commissions

2184
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,260
but in recent times

2185
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,260
I've been quite enjoying doing commissions

2186
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,260
well that's cool hit me

2187
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,260
I basically only do them when someone offers

2188
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,260
to pay me what I would consider

2189
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,260
to be more than what they're worth

2190
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,260
by a significant like

2191
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:44,260
the only price

2192
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,260
that I think is worth me doing a commission

2193
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,260
is something that I am totally not

2194
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,260
comfortable asking for

2195
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,260
yeah I'll tell you right now

2196
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,260
that yesterday I filmed

2197
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,260
all of these 27 rants

2198
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:58,260
that I've been spamming everybody's sub box with today

2199
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,260
those are

2200
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,260
$15 a month tier on

2201
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,260
Patreon I have like 50

2202
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,260
people on that tier only like half of them actually

2203
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,260
gave a rant

2204
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,260
that they wanted to give

2205
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,260
and of those you know I did it all

2206
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,260
in a day so like whatever

2207
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,260
that's not bad pay for one fucking day

2208
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,260
right exactly so

2209
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,260
you know in that sense

2210
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:22,260
those were commissioned videos basically

2211
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,260
and as long as the people are satisfied with them

2212
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,260
which I have not gotten any response from anybody

2213
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,260
who actually commissioned them

2214
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,260
so far but

2215
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,260
you know if that continues to work out

2216
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,260
I would consider myself to be someone

2217
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,260
with commissions open

2218
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,260
in that case

2219
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,260
you know I don't know

2220
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,260
when else I'd have a chance to say it I guess I could say it anytime

2221
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,260
but I might as well say it now

2222
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,260
so yeah I have a lot of people

2223
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,260
that have qualified for

2224
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,260
like reward art from my Patreon

2225
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,260
that have never contacted me about it

2226
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,260
I have sent out some

2227
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,260
I did send out emails at some point

2228
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,260
to a lot of people being like hey

2229
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,260
you qualified for reward art

2230
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:02,260
and you know a lot of people didn't get back to me

2231
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,260
they probably weren't pledging for reward

2232
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,260
they just wanted to support me which is cool

2233
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,260
but I don't know if you're listening to this

2234
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,260
and maybe you are a patron

2235
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,260
and you do want one

2236
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,260
like if I haven't already emailed you

2237
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,260
about it send me a message or something

2238
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,260
because like you know I want

2239
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,260
you know I want people to get

2240
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,260
what they're paying for

2241
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,260
yeah that's fair

2242
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,260
at some point I feel like I kind of lost track of that

2243
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:28,260
like I haven't had anyone be like

2244
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,260
hey you didn't give me the thing

2245
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,260
wait no there was one guy

2246
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,260
but then I gave him the things it was alright

2247
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,260
yeah

2248
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,260

2280
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,260
I've learned

2281
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,260
it's Vincent

2282
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,260

should I spoil the comic

2287
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,260
no he's not gay

2288
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,260
you know I haven't seen his rating system

2289
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,260
canonically I don't remember seeing

2290
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,260
his rating system

2291
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,260
did it apply to men

2292
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,260
did that do men as well

2293
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,260
he does

2294
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,260
yeah he does rate men

2295
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,260
possibly on different criteria though of course

2296
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,260
yeah it's not

2297
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,260
spelled out or anything

2298
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,260
at least yeah the things

2299
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,260
it doesn't say

2300
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,260
what it is that he's looking at

2301
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,260
but in my head I knew what it was

2302
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,260
that he was evaluating about them

2303
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,260
he evaluates them on different criteria

2304
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,260
um

2305
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,260
bye then

2306
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,260
sorry

2307
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,260
looking at men

2308
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,260
is one of the gayest things you can do

2309
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,260
and he did it a lot in that one chapter

2310
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,260
a bunch several men

2311
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,260
remember how that guy hit on him

2312
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,260
when he was sitting on the trash can

2313
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,260
he didn't hit on him

2314
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,260
that guy wasn't hitting on him

2315
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,260
that guy was trolling him hard

2316
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,260
I know I know I'm just fucking fun

2317
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,260
although that man bun

2318
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,260
is very metrosexual

2319
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,260
I'll say

2320
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,260
I saw a lot of man buns in Hawaii

2321
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,260
incidentally

2322
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,260
I've been thinking about going for the man bun

2323
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,260
it's

2324
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,260
my hair is long enough

2325
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,260
it's almost long enough

2326
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,260
I think man buns really

2327
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,260
you gotta be ripped to wear a man bun

2328
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,260
or like if you're fat that's one thing I guess

2329
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,260
you gotta be a big boy to pull off a man bun

2330
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,260
in my humble opinion

2331
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,260
yeah it's not a look forever

2332
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,260
it's definitely not a look for me

2333
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,260
so that's not what I just said

2334
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,260
total fabrication

2335
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,260
just like jack saint tricking me

2336
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,260
with the story of a centaur

2337
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:38,260
the neoliberal horror story

2338
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:40,260
indeed

2339
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,260
kinsheen slayer

2340
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,260
whatever go

2341
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,260
yo pcp how likely do y'all think it is

2342
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,260
that Sora is gonna be the next smash DLC

2343
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:50,260
to be announced

2344
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,260
since it'll be the absolute best time on january 25th

2345
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,260
alongside the release of kingdom march 3

2346
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,260
also this question is

2347
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,260
the entire pcp

2348
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,260
not just the guys on this episode

2349
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,260
and I'm not gonna make any promises

2350
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,260
but if you had a realistic warp sword

2351
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,260
what would it be and how would someone mail it to you

2352
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,260
axes and shit aren't allowed

2353
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,260
I can't make those strong enough out of pvc

2354
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:12,260
if you're in the rfck

2355
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,260
discord you can just ping or dm me

2356
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,260
my nickname is sword man

2357
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,260
is he offering to make us

2358
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
swords to fight with

2359
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,260
in a pcp video

2360
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,260
he's just putting it out there

2361
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,260
but he makes them

2362
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,260
I got a p.o. box dog check any we a go episode

2363
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,260
there's a link to that p.o. box

2364
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,260
I want a zvi hander

2365
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,260
I don't have a p.o. box

2366
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,260
that'd be cool

2367
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,260
shit I got that video of you swinging that zvi hander

2368
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,260
around at the fair I never uploaded it

2369
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,260
didn't you tweet it

2370
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,260
no I never did

2371
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,260
I meant to

2372
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:48,260
I'm just saying I know this is too much

2373
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,260
but the only sword thing that's cool

2374
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,260
is the absolutely retarded

2375
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,260
keyblade that's made of

2376
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,260
two swords crossed over

2377
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,260
like a fucking keyblade

2378
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,260
it looks embarrassing and terrible

2379
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,260
no wait it's two keyblade

2380
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,260
it's two keyblades

2381
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,260
crossed over a sword to make

2382
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,260
the keyblade yeah okay there you go

2383
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,260
um

2384
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,260
first of all is kingdom hearts coming

2385
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,260
to the switch I think it is

2386
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,260
let me double check right

2387
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,260
fucking now if it is then I literally would not

2388
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,260
even be surprised if uh if Sora came

2389
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,260
to the game kingdom hearts 3

2390
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,260
switch let's find out right now

2391
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,260
I think it is

2392
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,260
um not

2393
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:30,260
not considering switch version until after

2394
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,260
something something well that was in 2017

2395
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,260
it it won't

2396
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,260
if it's not on the switch then no

2397
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,260
if it's coming to the switch then maybe

2398
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,260
definitely okay I'm seeing things like in October

2399
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,260
saying that it maybe

2400
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,260
could maybe could square enix really

2401
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,260
wants it to I'm not seeing any

2402
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,260
confirmation but looks like

2403
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:50,260
people are talking oh my god dude

2404
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,260
square enix and Nintendo

2405
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,260
together again you know what that could

2406
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,260
mean Mario RPG 2

2407
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,260
it's time it's time

2408
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,260
Mario RPG 2 none of this paper Mario

2409
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,260
shit hey you know okay I think

2410
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,260
Sora is a super likely and frankly

2411
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,260
a great choice for for Smash Bros

2412
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,260
in my humble opinion but

2413
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,260
but I wonder if Disney

2414
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,260
is gonna be an obstacle in that

2415
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,260
cause Disney owned Sora

2416
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,260
and I wonder

2417
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,260
if that's gonna complicate things

2418
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,260
Square Enix doesn't own him? I don't think so

2419
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:22,260
I'm pretty sure Disney owned Sora

2420
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,260
damn

2421
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,260
I don't know I'm just saying that could be an issue

2422
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,260
I hope it happens though I think he's a

2423
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:30,260
really think he's a fantastic choice

2424
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,260
he would be really cool he'd be really cool

2425
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,260
oh they could have like a Twilight Town stage or something

2426
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,260
he'd be the one like human character

2427
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,260
that I would consider

2428
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,260
well I guess I'd play Rosalina

2429
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,260
so never mind take back everything

2430
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,260
yeah and I guess he would be

2431
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,260
sort of an anime sword boy

2432
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,260
but he's got tons of magic there's a lot of cool stuff

2433
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,260
you could do with Sora he's got tons of fucking abilities

2434
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,260
it's okay

2435
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,260
it's okay that he's an anime sword boy

2436
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:56,260
I would overlook that character flaw

2437
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,260
thank god

2438
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,260
okay my LARP sword

2439
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,260
well I have

2440
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,260
you know

2441
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,260
what do I like in swords I like

2442
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,260
flamborges but

2443
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,260
I'm not I'm not married to flamborges

2444
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,260
I like S stock actually I really like S stocks

2445
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,260
I don't know if that would even work

2446
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,260
as a LARP sword

2447
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,260
I'm imagining like a sword with like a black blade

2448
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,260
and like a black hilt and like white trim

2449
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,260
and like maybe the pommel has my like

2450
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,260
saint heart logo on it

2451
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,260
those are both like a like a rapier adjacent

2452
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,260
right

2453
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,260
an S stock is basically a rapier

2454
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,260
flamborges is like

2455
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,260
it's a broad sword but it has like the wavy blade

2456
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,260
only reason I know

2457
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,260
is because of soul caliber

2458
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:42,260
well yeah

2459
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,260
I know from like dark souls and various like

2460
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,260
final fancies and shit where you get these weapons

2461
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,260
and fuck I'm imagining I'm imagining

2462
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,260
a black blade black

2463
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,260
everything white trim with the saint heart

2464
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,260
like the saint heart pommel

2465
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,260
yeah

2466
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,260
other than that

2467
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,260
I'm not picky I don't know wink

2468
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,260
give me a make a keyblade that has sunglasses

2469
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,260
as the keychain it'll be my key

2470
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,260
blade haha got them

2471
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
don't make a key

2472
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,260
swordman don't lower yourself

2473
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,260
to making key blades

2474
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,260
what'd you say mage

2475
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,260
chakrams are just round swords

2476
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,260
yeah chakrams suck

2477
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,260
they're just frizz

2478
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,260
what even are they like the first time I ever saw them

2479
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:24,260
was fucking axel and kingdom hearts and shit

2480
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,260
like what the hell do those even do

2481
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,260
how would those be functional in combat

2482
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,260
if you use them with magic

2483
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,260
and make them float

2484
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,260
and you put them on fire

2485
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,260
amaranth and final fantasy 9 uses them right

2486
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,260
I don't know

2487
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,260
I'm pretty sure

2488
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,260
I imagine that the appeal is that

2489
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:44,260
you could just kind of spin around with them

2490
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,260
and cut shit

2491
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,260
don't you just throw them like frizzbees

2492
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:50,260
I really thought you just threw them like frizzbees

2493
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,260
the first time I saw them was in kingdoms

2494
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,260
of amalur

2495
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,260
freckling or something

2496
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,260
and like the way they battled with the chakrams

2497
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,260
looked really cool and I was just like

2498
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,260
and you make them float and you put them on fire

2499
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,260
and they just whoosh and wham

2500
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,260
and it's just so cool I love it

2501
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,260
that's when you have like a drone

2502
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:10,260
carrying your fucking chakram around

2503
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,260
I guess it could do more damage

2504
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:14,260
other than that

2505
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,260
I mean in real life I really doubt that they are

2506
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,260
very useful or whatever

2507
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:20,260
I guess they're just projectile weapons you just fucking throw them

2508
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,260
and they come back like a boomerang

2509
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,260
like a very deadly boomerang

2510
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,260
I don't think I want that to come back though

2511
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,260
like how are you going to catch that thing

2512
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,260
magic

2513
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,260
alright let's keep going we got two more questions here

2514
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,260
or calls or whatever

2515
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,260
here's one from doodlebee

2516
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,260
play

2517
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,260
go

2518
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,260
hello PCP

2519
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:44,260
what I want to know is

2520
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:46,260
why does everybody on this podcast

2521
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,260
speak with the same

2522
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,260
damn tone

2523
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:52,260
even people in these

2524
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,260
voicemails they all speak with the same tone

2525
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,260
I'm doing it now

2526
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,260
and

2527
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,260
thank you

2528
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,260
have you placed on everybody

2529
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,260
thank you and

2530
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,260
good day

2531
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,260
it's just called having a good radio voice

2532
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,260
it's like you naturally

2533
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,260
it's sort of like

2534
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:14,260
you try to project your voice

2535
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,260
more than normal because

2536
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,260
like you're

2537
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,260
you want it to just come through as clearly and understandably

2538
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,260
as possible I mean like normally

2539
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,260
people like

2540
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,260
if we were say acting

2541
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,260
your top priority isn't necessarily

2542
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,260
how clearly you speak

2543
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,260
it's how emotively you speak

2544
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,260
but if everyone is just emphasizing clarity

2545
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,260
everyone's emphasizing

2546
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,260
being understood as perfectly as possible

2547
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,260
then we're all going to be speaking very clearly

2548
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,260
in the same tone

2549
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,260
that's true

2550
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,260
I guess just the energy here

2551
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,260
people kind of just sync up

2552
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,260
when they're talking you kind of go to

2553
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,260
somebody's fucking vibe or something

2554
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,260
yeah I don't know some combination of that shit

2555
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,260
you know that's the thing

2556
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,260
like you start to talk like the people

2557
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,260
you spend time around

2558
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:02,260
your combination of like the six people

2559
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,260
that you spend the most time with

2560
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,260
I think our voicemails have undergone a really cool evolution

2561
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,260
because early on it was very much like

2562
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,260
in the exact style of like

2563
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:12,260
biggest problem or dick show voicemails

2564
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,260
where it's just kind of people calling in with like a rage

2565
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,260
you know and everybody just has this intense

2566
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,260
like I'm randin' about whatever

2567
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,260
but now it's like way more like a

2568
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:22,260
creative experiment

2569
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,260
that's my favorite thing

2570
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:26,260
it's great

2571
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,260
I'm so glad we ditched the questions

2572
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,260
me too

2573
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,260
the voicemails are amazing

2574
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,260
they're better than the show

2575
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,260
and speaking of voicemails

2576
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,260
we've got one final

2577
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,260
strong contender

2578
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,260
bringing up the rear it's a voicemail

2579
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,260
from the legendary dumbass mcdumbfuck

2580
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,260
let's see what he's got for us

2581
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,260
alright bring us home boy let's go

2582
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,260
alright so I'm a content man

2583
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,260
I'm a content boy I want to make stuff

2584
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,260
and I make stuff

2585
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,260
the problem is I haven't made anything

2586
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,260
so uh

2587
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,260
can you tell me the first thing

2588
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:04,260
I should make

2589
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:06,260
should I draw a thing

2590
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,260
should I music a thing

2591
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,260
should I go to things

2592
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,260
and literally any option is okay

2593
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:14,260
other than it doesn't matter what option I pick

2594
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,260
so fuck you

2595
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,260
he really lived up to his name with this question

2596
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,260
he really did

2597
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,260
I'm thinking you make me a sword

2598
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,260
I'm thinking like a black blade

2599
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:26,260
like a black pommel like white trim

2600
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,260
with a saint heart on the pommel

2601
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:30,260
just express yourself to the exact parameters

2602
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,260
Ben specifies

2603
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:34,260
just take a shit and take a picture of it

2604
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,260
and uh put it in a frame

2605
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,260
everyone's gotta start somewhere

2606
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,260
just fucking you know what you wanted

2607
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,260
if you're listening just fucking do a let's play dude

2608
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:44,260
just don't be a pussy

2609
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,260
just do a let's play

2610
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,260
just record yourself talking about something

2611
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,260
and put it on me

2612
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,260
Ben and I started just with

2613
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,260
we saw other people doing it

2614
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,260
so we literally just did what seemed popular

2615
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,260
can't emphasize enough

2616
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,260
how much you don't have to like each other

2617
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,260
in fact it might even be better if you hate each other

2618
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,260
could be

2619
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,260
Ben and I just were like hey we talk about this thing

2620
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:08,260
let's just record it

2621
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,260
and then we did so just fucking do that

2622
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,260
or I mean this guy is not even married

2623
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,260
to like you two or anything

2624
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,260
he literally just wants to know what to do

2625
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,260
just tell him what you would want

2626
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,260
over the last year or two

2627
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,260
people in the hellfire hamlet

2628
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,260
a bunch of like podcasts

2629
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,260
a bunch of people make podcasts together now

2630
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,260
it's cool

2631
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,260
here's what I most want

2632
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,260
so just create this

2633
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,260
because it is what I want

2634
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,260
is just make

2635
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,260
like YouTube videos

2636
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,260
that are just

2637
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:42,260
entertaining enough

2638
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,260
that I don't get completely bored having it

2639
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,260
on in the background

2640
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:48,260
but are not so entertaining that I have to actually watch them

2641
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,260
because I don't have a TV

2642
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,260
in my house so I just have to

2643
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,260
use a constant stream of like Anthony

2644
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,260
Fantano videos as my version

2645
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,260
of television and I need more

2646
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,260
yeah that makes sense

2647
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,260
I do the same thing

2648
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,260
I'm gonna go on a

2649
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,260
slightly different tack

2650
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,260
I'm gonna say make

2651
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,260
the greatest YouTube videos

2652
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,260
of all time and change the landscape

2653
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,260
forever more

2654
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,260
by everyone

2655
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,260
comes to you because you're just so much better

2656
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,260
than everyone else

2657
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,260
and do that so that I have

2658
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,260
you know hire goals to aspire to

2659
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,260
yeah I want

2660
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,260
I want and like and be so good

2661
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,260
and then also choose to

2662
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,260
not use Patreon anymore

2663
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,260
and you know literally yourself

2664
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,260
inspire a new medium

01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,260

oh jesus christ superstar

2699
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,260
once you wanted to do a podcast about that

01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,260
no we'll talk about that

2703
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,260
maybe we can do that as a bonus

2704
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,260
I'm just saying everybody there's a chance we will do a video

2705
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,260
of some sort about jesus christ superstar so if you haven't seen it

2706
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,260
go watch it before then

2707
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,260

2714
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,260
