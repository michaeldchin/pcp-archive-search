1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I have rights, you have rights, even animals has rights.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So earlier on I got in two professors, an animal rights activist, and a woman with a hedgehog to ask them some questions.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and Mumkey Jones is here.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello everyone, I'm the nostalgia Mumkey. I remember it so you don't have to.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Classic comedy. Hippocrit is here.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't have anything after that. That's a good one.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That really stole the show. We should just quit right now.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What a great bit. You should start a whole thing about that. You should start a whole channel and branch out and make it a whole franchise.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I bet that channel would be awesome. I feel like you can incorporate wearing glasses into this character that you've just come up with.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, that Mumkey with the glasses. Yeah, that's a good one.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll do this great thing where I take a movie and I condense it into six seconds, and it'll be like Titanic in six seconds.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's a pretty good idea. Tom's all here. I'm here.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I guess Ben's here.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Talk about cultural appropriation.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's true. Okay, so today we're talking about Animal Rights.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I just finished my Monkey Studies class 101.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For my Gen Ed requirements. Fantastic.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
National Monkey History Month.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That was in February.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ouch, harsh.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're talking about animal rights. Animal rights.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And if you believe it or not, there is an Urban Dictionary definition for animal rights.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So let's take a gander here. Animal rights.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A philosophy that suggests, does that evape? Did I just hear a fucking vape?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, of course not. Of course it wasn't.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The vape is here?

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That would never happen.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Guys, I think we need to punish Ben for this vaping bullshit.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'm prepared to do a monkey siren every time I hear this shit to alert you all.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That sounds like a good idea.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If I hear a fucking vape, I'm going to go...

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then you'll all know.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is just going to be a game of cat and mouse of how subtly can I vape before I said it?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm just going to be pushing the boundaries every time.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like that monkey with the symbols in Toy Story 3.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, exactly.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Anyway, excuse me.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Here's our definition. Yes, yes, excuse you indeed.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's the definition of douchebag who vapes all the time?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ben St. Look at that.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So animal rights.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's rare that the definition is shorter than the word.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, it happens. Animal rights.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A philosophy that suggests some or all animals have the right to possess their own lives.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Contrary to popular opinion, animal rights activists do not ask for voting rights for chickens or pigs.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Rather, they ask that animals not be used for food, entertainment, medical research, or clothing.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Some activists maintain that there is a distinction between the sentient or self-aware animals,

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and those with a large degree of self-awareness are to be afforded the right to possess their own lives.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, a little bit more. Animal rights are also largely tied to dietary lifestyles such as vegetarianism and veganism

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
who would hoard the consumption of meat products in accordance with the principles of animal rights.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There you go.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In this podcast, animal rights means animals shouldn't be treated any differently than humans.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you wouldn't eat a human, you wouldn't eat an animal. Is that what we're going with?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't think so.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think it's more like should we treat them like decency.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That definition seemed to imply that believing in animal rights period means that we shouldn't eat animals.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I love animal rights period.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's a little bit beyond the pale of what I would expect.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's other definitions here.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, we're going to come up with our own reasonable definition.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think the animal rights in general is a broad scope as to whether animals, any organism besides human,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
whether it deserves any rights at all to its own life, to its existence, whether we should respect it and its habitat,

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
whether it's all under the same umbrella.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't care at all.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the worst topic ever.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's a position.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm glad you signed up for this episode, Hippo.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, see you later, Hippo.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You wanted me to be here.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You know you wanted yourself to be here.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You signed up, goddammit. Nobody signed you up.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mumki said he wanted me to be here. I don't know why.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, don't tell them I see that I got you and Tom here specifically because I like you.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have a Hippo who is your son.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, he's not my son.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's your daughter then.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's my roommate.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't assume he's gender.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hippo's listening to this podcast and shedding a single tear as he hears this.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Concecutive single tears.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm just his roommate.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, well, let me take my position here and we can go from there.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think that I actually, I was going to say my first thought was no animals deserve any rights at all, including humans can do whatever they want to animals and I do not give a fuck.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've changed that opinion slightly because I realized that if that definition was if I use that, I don't actually think humans have very, you know, I don't think that human intelligence is anything particularly like special in the sense that it distinguishes us from animals.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're just better at achieving our goals.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What I'm going to say is I think, yeah, well, you know, you're smarter than animals.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, no, we are.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We are definitely smarter.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But for example, some humans have intelligence that is, I mean, not like animal level, but like closer to animal level.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So like, where does the, where does the cutoff lie?

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think even somebody with a Down syndrome is smarter than a gopher.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not disputing that at all.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But what I am saying is there is like a measurable scale of intelligence and you say all animals don't matter.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You should take like like something like a dolphin, people say, right? Dolphins are generally pretty smart.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you can measure the intelligence of a dolphin and say that it is worth keeping and I don't know what the standard should be.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if we could figure that out, that should be the standard for whether or not we care about it.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have a thought on this.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dolphins, people like dolphins because, you know, they're like, they can do tricks.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They can talk.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
They'd be like, and we're like, oh, that's nice.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, I like that thing.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I won't kill it.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And any animal that has, has made us enamored with it so that we don't kill it is smart enough to live.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think it's just, there's no like a level of intelligence.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There's no like a data point.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There's no math number that we can attribute to any like on a scale.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What animals should we kill and what should we not?

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I disagree.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think, I think if we like animals to be alive, then they should live.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, but just think about it for a second.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What you're doing there is just making an emotional argument for things that humans like.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's my point.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't care about like, oh, what's the, we should try to like categorize everything and make it like a hard distinction.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you like your dog, you shouldn't eat your dog.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But if other people don't care about their dogs, they can eat them.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It just depends on who you are and where you are in the society around you.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here's the reason why there's a flaw in that argument.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because what if humans were to someday meet some organism that was, you know, human level intelligence or higher, who knows,

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but was just repellent on many levels, kind of like the bugs from Starship Troopers.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What if we were to encounter a species like that and just assume that they were bad and gross and we didn't like them,

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
even if like, so I'm proposing a universal standard for, we will care about a creature.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know what those bugs are like.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can they talk to us with language?

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, they do communicate with each other.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, a lot of them are just grunts, but they do have like queens and those seem to have like human level intelligence, if not higher.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Not like super intelligence.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, then she should be an ambassador and then people will be like, oh, I guess these people, these are like, this is a different race.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We should be treating them like a minority.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, that's totally true.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, so like terribly.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So like herd them into camps and cook them and eat them.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, okay, I think Starship Troopers is actually a great example of this because the whole deal behind Starship Troopers,

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
fantastic movie, everybody go watch it if you haven't, is that humans got into this war with the bugs based mostly on a misunderstanding.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A bug war, if you will.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It was in fact a bug war.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It was 100% a bug war if only Mochi was here.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I forgot about the bug war.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You should never forget about the bug war.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Every day, Ben.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh my God, I'm part of the problem.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The Syrian refugee crisis wages on every day and you just turn a blind eye to it, Ben.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So too does the bug war.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, that describes me too.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, so in that movie, okay, the point is that humans in that movie don't give a fuck about the bugs because they're gross and they don't understand them.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Even though like throughout the movie, there are clearly signs that the bugs are only defending their territory and are only like retaliating against humans because humans, you know, aggressed against them

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and are like trying to colonize their solar system and shit.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So that's why the bugs attack humans.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's based totally on a misunderstanding, whereas they could totally have gotten along or just left each other alone if they just didn't fuck with each other.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But it's like the propaganda of, ew, emotionally, we don't like these bugs.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And the propaganda throughout the film is fantastic at illustrating how nonsensical it is.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Humans just start stomping on cockroaches on Earth as if that's a fucking resistance against the bugs in space.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But you understand my point here, it's just that we need some sort of hard system.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can alter my stance a bit to fit with that.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Say, for example, where there's like a bug comes and it says, no, we're intelligent, you idiot.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then one of the humans is like, oh, they're intelligent.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Wait, we should stop killing them.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then there's other humans are like, I don't care, I gotta go.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm gonna smash them.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Then at that point, it will be up to the humans to decide amongst themselves democratically or however they decide things,

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
whether that new species should be considered a beast or a potential, you know, new species we can talk to.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And that will be like, what I'm saying is a universal standard is to, you know, the amount of things we could ever find out in space, for example, is ridiculous.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't think a universal standard will count for the whole universe.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think we should just take things as they come.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, I mean, you could separate it into different components.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Like if they are actively trying to kill you this entire race.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We're here today on the PCP talking about animal rights.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We're 10 minutes in and the scope of our argument has already expanded to a universal, extra galactic scale.

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It has to though.

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It doesn't have to.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Because I'm talking about a universal.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It really doesn't have to, Nick.

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We can talk, believe it or not.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
These arguments will apply to my thoughts on, like, why we can eat meat.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I like chicken.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So we can go back to that.

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So we can go back to that.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I like hugging chickens.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, sure.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Agreed.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But like, what about something like, you know, doing makeup experiments on monkeys?

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like, where do you draw the line on that?

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How does the bug empire, Nate, help you answer the makeup monkey question?

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Simply.

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Simply because the same principle applies.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So, okay, monkeys are really, really retarded and stupid.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Monkeys.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Monkeys are okay some of the time.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
God damn it.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Like, okay, the thing, why do humans, you know, care about dogs, right?

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's because dogs, A, are generally like loyal and they'll, you know, they like your scent and they get used to you and they like it.

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And they're cute.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And they'll be nice to you.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Right.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And they're also like attractive visually.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They're cute.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They're cute.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Most importantly.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, they're highly attractive.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Most importantly, that they're subservient.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like, if all dogs were, like, by default, like, vicious and you had to tame every single one.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We wouldn't like dogs.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We'd kill them.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They'd be like wolves and lions.

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And also all dogs would have true.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, because they're pure of heart, unlike humans.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Unlike humans.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, but here's the thing about dogs.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, we, you know, we enjoy their company as a species very much.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We've bred them to be that way and, you know, that may or may not have issues, but assuming

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that that's just how it was, no problem there.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But at the current day, like, people like dogs because they're nice to us.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But does that, and that's why we don't...

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Discussing animal rights.

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And that's why, like, we care about them in general as a species.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But, like, is there anything...

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do we know that a dog really...

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What is the value of a dog's life to itself, you know?

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you kill a dog...

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Is a dog not entitled to the sweat of his own brow?

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I know.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't think that he is.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wait, wait, I think if you kill a dog, I think it won't know that it's dead because it's

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
be dead.

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, a human that doesn't know that it's dead either.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Exactly.

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, so what's the standard for not being allowed to kill, you know, just as one example

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
of something you can do to it?

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, you're allowed to kill a dog.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's not like you go to jail for it.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's not actually true all the time.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, there's laws.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There's animal abuse laws and stuff.

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Right.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And we're here saying revoke them.

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Trump, revoke that shit.

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's time to go back.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Make America great again.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let me kill my dog.

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's the single greatest social issue facing us today.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm a one issue voter, guys.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I vote for whichever candidate will let me kill my dog.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But to get back to the point that Mumki was making about using animals for makeup testing

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and stuff, like, okay, so clearly the animals don't seem to enjoy that too much, right?

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They're not into it in general.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You could call that mistreatment, but how much should we actually care about the suffering

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
of any animal?

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And in this case, you know, we're talking about a monkey, a monkey.

255
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I would say we should only really give a shit if it is like at a certain level of intelligence

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
where it's like cognizant.

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
See, you're just making it more complicated than it has to be.

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Am I?

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Here's what I think.

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Just appeal to your emotions.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you like the monkey and you want it to be happy, then you should just let it be.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's not good enough.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Here's the thing.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I would not paint makeup on a monkey's face and then, I don't know, like blast it with

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
a fire hose to see how much punishment it could take before the makeup or opposite.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I wouldn't do that.

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I would feel like I was a shitty person if I did that.

268
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Therefore, I think it's a shitty thing to do and they shouldn't do it.

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I mean, that's why you feel that way.

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is it because you're anthropomorphizing that monkey and projecting the feelings that you

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
as a human would have if that happened to you?

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because they share like 99% of our DNA.

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We share like 50% of our DNA with a fucking banana.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I feel sorry for bananas and the monkeys eat them.

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, I bet you do.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But, I mean, we understand faces and two eyes and stuff.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Monkeys have like a face, you know.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
As a human being animal, as a human animal, we recognize a monkey's face and we think,

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ah, he's got emotions.

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He's got a face.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He's got a family.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't know that.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's an assumption being made.

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, but we're imperfect beings.

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We're not robots, Nate.

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We can't be robots.

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You'll never be a robot.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We should strive for perfection, Dave.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We should strive for a better system.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's true that we can't know that the monkey has feelings like our own, but we can't know

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that about one another either.

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We can't see into each other's minds any more than we can see into the monkeys.

293
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We can make logical distinctions about what other humans are experiencing.

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm just saying that it's more difficult.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, we can make informed guesses.

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's all we can ever do about anything in our entire lives.

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And that's what we're doing when we say, oh, this monkey looks like it's in pain.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I feel bad.

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Right.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No.

301
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But I'm saying, why should we care that it's in pain?

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What is the standard we're using to give a shit about that?

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I have an answer for you.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's a real question.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, it is a real question.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because when we decided this would be the topic, when it comes to monkey rights, and

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm not even meaming here, it's something that I'm actually kind of passionate about.

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I knew I was going to get emotional talking about it.

310
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And as we all know, when I get emotional on this show, I don't give the best arguments.

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So I actually wrote something up that I wanted to read about monkey rights.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay.

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you guys are ready.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is only applied to monkeys or this is applied to other animals?

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Just for monkeys.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Other animals I don't care as much about.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But, you know, I got a thing for monkeys.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Does somebody have like a bird chirping in the background?

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sorry, my window's open.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You want me to close it?

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll get that.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The bird is very distracting.

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That bird was waning.

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
All right.

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In present day America, the monkey is still not free.

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The life of the monkey is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The monkey lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The monkey is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.

331
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This note was a promise that all men, yes, monkey men, as well as white men,

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Written by me.

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is that right? Written by you.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Good one. Good one.

339
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So that's why I think monkeys should have rights.

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think I heard a similar...

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Did I not hear a similar speech that one time?

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I feel like it was, you know...

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That speech came to me in a dream.

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I said, I have a dream of this speech.

345
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, I agree with that. I hate black people, though.

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, my God.

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Of course, of course.

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's why I wanted to do the episode.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Now I'm done.

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll see you guys in an hour for the questions.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, can I just say, I want to clarify just one thing about the argument.

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And it was just that...

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So we don't care, right?

354
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When you squish an ant, nobody gives a shit.

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It does not matter.

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Because ants are only bad.

357
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They're only negative forces on my life.

358
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They don't give me happiness like a monkey or a dog.

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, right, but that's still kind of an emotional thing.

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But even when you get to something like a spider...

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But being happy is intrinsically valuable.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not just an emotion.

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It benefits my life in so many ways.

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If I'm a serial killer and I enjoy killing humans,

365
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
then that makes me happy, but it does not benefit everybody else.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, sure, but that's an offset.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's an outlier.

368
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We're talking like general humanity, not just the serial killers.

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Well, but these are unanswered questions among human society.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I still don't understand at all what you're saying.

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay, I was trying to get that.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I feel like you've got...

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, go on, please.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Lay out your thesis for us.

375
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay, it's very clear to me.

376
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, so we don't care if small insects or whatever die.

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We don't spend a moment to consider their well-being whatsoever.

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And yet we do when it comes to things that start to get a little bit more like us.

379
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Like a hamster or a gerbil or whatever.

380
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And then, of course, we get to like a dog.

381
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, that's my dude.

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And when we get to something like a dog or, I don't know, like a deer.

383
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We hear about dogs more than deers and shit.

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know what the standard is.

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So what I'm getting at is what exactly is the standard we're using

386
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
for how much we care about the well-being of these animals?

387
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So your thesis is just a question?

388
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No, no.

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
My thesis is I have the solution.

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And what we should do is we should measure the intelligence of each of these animals,

391
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
make an actual determination about what their value is.

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Alright, Nate.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But the thing is that applies to humans, too.

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's just rank them all on a scale.

395
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's exactly what we should do.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And you should take everyone as an individual and, you know...

397
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But there is no scale, Nate.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can't just fucking measure everyone's IQ and be like,

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
oh, here's where they fall on the spectrum of worth.

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What a brave new world this is.

401
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But we have to.

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, I think so.

403
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What is your better solution?

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My better solution is that you shut the fuck up.

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm trying to solve problems here.

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You said the thing about we don't care about insects.

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I mean, some people do.

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And if you anthropomorphize like an insect, if you watch it, you know,

409
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you can be like, oh, look at him.

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He's going to go get his lunch.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like, you can make like little, like, you know, you can trick your brain into thinking of them as like...

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can be like Carl Pilkington and convince yourself that you saw a bee have a heart attack from overwork.

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right.

414
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's right.

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Stuff like that.

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My hero.

417
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He is just the perfect example of this shit.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He's the cutoff point for what is not worth human rights.

419
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He's just below.

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's just below the cutoff point.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He's right on the cusp.

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So basically, it's not like universal that we all hate bugs, but we all like monkeys.

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Some people hate monkeys.

424
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's not even about hating.

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's just about not caring about them.

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Some people hate giraffes.

427
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Some people hate hippos.

428
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know, it's just the way it is.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It shouldn't be about hating.

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It should be about, you know, it's like whether we care about them or not.

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Some people hate people.

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Some people don't care about certain animals and they care about others.

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The point I'm saying is that my stance when it comes to animals is that I think, you know,

434
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll respect them.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I won't kick a puppy just for fun, but if he starts to kill me, then I will.

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But if I want to eat that puppy, then I'll kick him.

437
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, if I want to eat that puppy, I'll tell someone else to do it because I don't want to do that.

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There are...

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm aware that there are complications to this.

440
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Like, you know, when a baby is born, like, it can't sustain itself, so is it really valuable?

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Like, you have to take, like, the potential of the organism into account.

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, there you go.

443
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There you go.

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You dismantled your own argument.

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No, no, I didn't.

446
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Real good there.

447
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There has never been a case of, like, an ant getting intelligent enough to be worth caring about.

448
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Why do you care so much about the value?

449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll tell you why.

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh, I know why.

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm thinking about the long-reaching ramifications of our current idea systems.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That is what I worry about.

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm just like, let's get a good value now so that we can be ready for the future, whatever happens then.

454
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Also, if you come with your little calculator, you can punch in the numbers.

455
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Right, so we can hook up our brain storage spaceship and use them for faster than we can.

456
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just try to make gunbusters happen.

457
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Try to make gunbusters happen, yes.

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Is there just, like, do you have any humanity at all?

459
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Why do you care about the value so much that it comes into everything you do?

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I think that, like, the only ethical system that is coherent at all and isn't, like, hypocritical is...

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, fuck.

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I had a whole thing and I cut out.

463
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What happened?

464
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I had a whole...

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I guess we just couldn't hear him.

466
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I had a whole thing and I said it and...

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Say it again.

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We can interrupt Ben.

469
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's okay.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The gist of what I was saying is, Nate, why do you care about the value so much when it comes to everything?

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Say you had a dog and, you know, you punched in the numbers in your little thing.

472
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You realize that it didn't have any value.

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Would you just kill it right then and there or, you know, do you have any humanity?

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's not about just deciding to kill it.

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's about worrying about it.

476
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's about being concerned about its well-being.

477
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's the issue.

478
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's not like whether I'm just going to shoot things that I don't like.

479
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's just not something I do.

480
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I just don't see why you care about, like, the intrinsic value of anything to the point where it comes into everything.

481
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Like, hmm, should I worry about this?

482
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If you're worried about it, like, on an instinctual level.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll tell you exactly why.

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'll tell you exactly why.

485
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because human instinct is not good enough.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We need logical systems to enforce human behavior in the right ways.

487
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hippo, I'm right there with you.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm right on board with that exasperated sigh.

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You see, you guys think that, like, oh, well, how could you say that?

490
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That's never been done before.

491
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Except so much of human behavior today has been shaped by philosophy.

492
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We're not, like, shaking our heads at what a rogue visionary you are.

493
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Like, that's not...

494
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Then what's the problem?

495
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Then what is the problem?

496
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Because you're just fucking talking a bunch of shit, man.

497
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Everything I've said makes perfect sense.

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I guess...

499
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If the criticism is what I'm saying is too obvious, then that's great.

500
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Then I hope that's...

501
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's not that it's too obvious.

502
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's just the way you're laying it out is just way too simplistic.

503
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And it doesn't have any application in our life.

504
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You're such an airy-fairy thinking about all these concepts all the time,

505
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and then you come to real life, and then it doesn't matter.

506
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
None of it matters.

507
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Can't we just talk about specific things like overcrowding on chicken farms

508
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
or, like, the way we treat a pig?

509
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Like, these weird philosophical ideas that you have with Star Trek and shit?

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Not when Nate's on the podcast.

511
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You can talk about anything you want.

512
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Nate's on the podcast.

513
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm so sorry for leading the conversation down a path that you guys can't follow

514
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
because you're too fucking dumb.

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're little pee brains. You're little pee brains.

516
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Just can't comprehend the next level shit that's going on up there.

517
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's too scary for you, Nate. I can't handle it.

518
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That's right. I know.

519
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's tough, man. It's tough.

520
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, let me give my spiel.

521
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think that the only thing that makes sense in life is to put yourself first

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and to put your own needs above everyone else's.

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Because if you don't do that, then what the fuck are you doing?

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Someone's been reading a little Ayn Rand.

525
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
What was wrong with your guys' parents?

526
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
How do they raise these two monsters?

527
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No, that makes sense, though, on some level.

528
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, I'm willing to sacrifice of myself if there are people that are worse off than me.

529
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Well, there's always going to be people worse off than me.

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You can't help everyone. You can't do it.

531
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It just doesn't make any sense.

532
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You can't even live.

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think that unless you accept that I'm just looking out for myself,

534
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you either just can't live at all or you're just going to be wrapped in hypocrisy

535
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that you'll never solve and will never be acknowledged.

536
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I think...

537
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Because you watch out for yourself. You do what benefits you.

538
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You can help the people that you care about because helping them helps you.

539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And that all makes sense and is fine.

540
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You can give to charity because it makes you feel like a good person or whatever.

541
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's all fine.

542
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But ultimately, ultimately...

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And this is just...

544
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I really think I'm just arguing for basic human nature here,

545
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
which I think should just be the default position.

546
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But I just think that's what makes sense.

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I think that that makes sense on a species level, too.

548
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think that humanity should just be...

549
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay, humanity should put humanity's needs first.

550
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And other speed...

551
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, we can watch out for them because having them around benefits us.

552
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But when push comes to shove and it comes down to it...

553
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, I really think that we should...

554
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
If it...

555
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
To benefit ourselves, anything should go...

556
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Anything goes and other animals just...

557
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Fuck them, right?

558
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like, they got to watch out for themselves.

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Even though they can't.

560
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We're just lucky.

561
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We're just lucky that other animals can't fight back.

562
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, we get it.

563
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But Ben...

564
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So if you knew that your neighbor was viciously beating his pet dog,

565
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
you would say,

566
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Well, I'm not going to get involved.

567
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I guess that's fine.

568
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Dogs should get beat if the guy wants to or whatever.

569
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Uh, no.

570
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, that'd make me mad.

571
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How does that benefit you?

572
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because it makes me upset that the dog is being beat.

573
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So I guess it's on an individual level for everybody then

574
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
where if you personally don't want dogs to get beat, then go for it.

575
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I guess so, yeah.

576
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm fine with that.

577
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Alright.

578
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I think there's enough good people in the world to stop all the dogs

579
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
from getting abused all the time.

580
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I would like to think so.

581
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I like to think more people.

582
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think there is because if we appeal to the emotion,

583
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
most people feel that way about dogs.

584
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, like on an emotional level,

585
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
most people are willing to eat meat

586
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
but also feel sad when they see an animal being harmed, you know?

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah.

588
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, that's fair.

589
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, but that doesn't solve anything.

590
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That doesn't help the situation at all.

591
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It doesn't solve anything.

592
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The problem, Nate, is that there is not an issue.

593
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You say like,

594
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh, the issue is like, you know,

595
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's not what animals we should kill.

596
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's like, which animals should be worried about?

597
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Right.

598
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's not a problem.

599
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's not a problem that comes up in my everyday life.

600
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm not wondering what I should be worried about.

601
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Just because it doesn't come up in your daily life

602
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
does not mean it's not a problem.

603
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't see how it's a problem.

604
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's just blinding yourself to things that you aren't aware of.

605
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But that's the whole issue.

606
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That you don't think it's a problem.

607
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Because it could be a problem one day.

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How could it be a problem?

609
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay, here's how it could be a problem.

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It is possible that every cow that we murder for us to eat

611
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
actually is a conscious entity

612
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and is really upset about it

613
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and we're just committing genocide every single day.

614
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That is possible and I would like to look into that.

615
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay, that's just one example.

616
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But I want to apply that logic across the board

617
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
to make sure we do the right thing.

618
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm pretty sure that cows don't like being killed.

619
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's why I said it's just one...

620
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But that's the thing.

621
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Whether we should give a shit.

622
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Because if it just is reacting to pain

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and it's pain receptors, then...

624
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think people react to pain exactly the same way.

625
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't think there's too much of a difference between a cow and a human

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
when it comes to death.

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Reacting to pain and our pain receptors is exactly what we do.

628
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then tell me, Gib, why do you care if a human dies

629
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and you don't care if a cow dies? What's the difference?

630
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well, I don't necessarily care if a human dies.

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It depends on who the human is.

632
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't by default care about humans more than I care about cows.

633
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I hear about people dying in the news all the time.

634
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It doesn't affect me at all.

635
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You would care if a human died in front of you

636
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
or if a cow died in front of you.

637
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes, both the same.

638
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because it's death happening in front of me.

639
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That would not be the same.

640
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No, they wouldn't be the same, but they would both disturb me.

641
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah, they would both disturb me.

642
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Seeing something in front of you is a lot different

643
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
from knowing that something happens.

644
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I know slaughterhouses kill animals and I eat the meat.

645
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I know people die in horrific wars

646
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and I don't eat that meat.

647
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I mean, they don't sell that meat.

648
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But if I were to see either of those things in real life

649
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I would get upset and disturbed and want it to stop.

650
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But I don't see it in real life.

651
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't see it all the time.

652
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's just out of my vision.

653
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But just because...

654
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay, the problem right now, Nate, is that you're thinking...

655
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You are saying nothing of value.

656
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You are saying nothing of value.

657
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If I don't see it, it's not a problem.

658
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No, let's not.

659
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The whole thing is that, Nate, you're talking again

660
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
from a grand humanitarian vision.

661
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We need to set a precedent that sets all of human behavior

662
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and elevates all of humanity as a species.

663
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Where Gib is just saying,

664
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm just trying to live my life and half...

665
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
99% of the time I don't give a fuck about any of this

666
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
because it doesn't affect me personally.

667
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's two different lifestyle choices

668
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and philosophical perspectives on how to run yourself.

669
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's really what I was doing there.

670
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I was just trying to explain to Nate

671
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
why I don't care about his issues that he seems to have.

672
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You're not concerning yourself with the long-standing...

673
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But that's not an argument against anything I'm saying.

674
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You're just saying you don't care.

675
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, and I'm explaining why I'm sighing

676
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
every time you bring this up because I think it doesn't matter.

677
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
That's why I was saying it.

678
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It doesn't matter to you.

679
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay, got it.

680
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It doesn't matter to you.

681
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It does matter to me.

682
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Every week, it's just...

683
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Nate presents some grand vision

684
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
of how humanity needs to change right now.

685
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That's right.

686
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And we all just listen and sigh.

687
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Nate just needs to start a new podcast called

688
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Nate Fleet where it's all about creating a better humanity.

689
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
How are we going to be a guest on there?

690
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The best future ever.

691
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Can I be the co-pilot on that ship?

692
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'll have to figure that out.

693
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't know if you're qualified.

694
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Nate, just to bring this down,

695
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
let's take it down from the grand philosophy thing.

696
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's look at some specific examples

697
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and then you can use your philosophy.

698
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The only reason I start grand is because you can write.

699
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's the idea.

700
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That's good.

701
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
For example, slaughterhouses with cows,

702
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
they're kept in these little bins where they can't move.

703
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They can't even step forward or sit down.

704
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They're stuck standing all day to keep their meat nice and plump

705
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and juicy and all that shit.

706
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What's it called?

707
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Kosher?

708
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
If you're going to kill a cow the Kosher way,

709
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
which is like the Jewish bullshit,

710
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you have to hang it upside down and then cut it

711
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and then it bleeds out and it's very painful and torturous.

712
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What do you think about all that shit?

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Is that okay?

714
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Here's the thing.

715
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I think cows are under the standard of intellectually caring about them,

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so I'm fine with all of it.

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Totally don't care.

718
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It can go on all day.

719
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
See, I'm okay with killing cows to eat them

720
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and I'm not trying to...

721
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't know why we bought it in vegan shit at the beginning

722
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
because that's retarded.

723
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm okay with eating chickens and cows and meat,

724
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
but I'm not okay with it being tortured in order to die.

725
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think you can just kill it in a second.

726
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You don't have to torture that fucker like the Kosher way.

727
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, here's the thing.

728
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think that I am logically consistent on this point

729
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
because I say I am not interested.

730
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I do think that it is not worth worrying about the well-being of a cow

731
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and that applies to every aspect of its life.

732
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You can torture it.

733
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You can do whatever you want to, chop off all its legs,

734
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
bleed it out for its whole life, fill its veins with acid.

735
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Those are all equally things that I am not concerned about

736
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
about the life of a cow.

737
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Just because it's not as smart as you?

738
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's correct.

739
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But Nate, if you were there in the slaughterhouse

740
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and they were like, hey, best guy ever, come here a minute.

741
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
On the one hand, here's like a bolt gun.

742
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You're working at the slaughterhouse because, I don't know,

743
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
just shut up, stop criticizing me.

744
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Here's a bolt gun.

745
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You got to kill this cow.

746
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Here's a thing that you could just jam a rod into this cow's head

747
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and it would be dead in a second.

748
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Alternatively, it will pay you slightly more

749
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
if you will hang this cow up

750
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and gently slit its skin in some points

751
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and you need to watch it bleed out for an entire several hours.

752
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Like that scene from Reservoir Dogs.

753
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You got to play the song and dance around and stab it and shit.

754
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So we can assume I'll get more money for doing something way worse is the idea.

755
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

756
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Would you just be fine?

757
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Would you be like, oh, well, okay, it marginally benefits me.

758
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So I guess I'll just do it this other way and that's fine.

759
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Would you just be fine with that?

760
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I hear what you're saying and here's the thing.

761
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The issue is this is totally involved,

762
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
but it's not a sort of a part of the logical framework.

763
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But okay, so to answer your question, I would not do that.

764
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
No.

765
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I think it is for a very reasonable reason.

766
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Okay, yeah.

767
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I am a normal human being with all my emotional societal conditioning

768
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
built into me, which just informs me that, yes,

769
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
these things are weird and gross and uncomfortable to do.

770
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And I have never killed anything in my life.

771
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This is why I feel like you say you're not being hypocritical with your point.

772
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You're consistent on your point.

773
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's your job.

774
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's your job.

775
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But you say you're not being consistent on your point.

777
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But even then, as a normal human, you recognize that you will think differently

778
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
from your big philosophical idea that cows are not important.

779
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's a nuanced point there.

780
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, I understand, Nate, that what you're saying is that, like,

781
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
ideally, logically, it should not matter what we do to this cow.

782
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And whereas you can't divorce yourself from your human emotional response,

783
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
even though intellectually you know that it's fine,

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but it still feels wrong because of lizard brain or whatever.

785
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Well, I mean, I guess I can understand that point.

786
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Well, here's where I disagree with you.

787
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't think it makes sense to say, oh, here's a cutoff point,

788
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
because Carl Pilkington, who's just above the cutoff point

789
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and a silverback gorilla who's just below it,

790
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
they're very similar to each other.

791
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There's not a meaningful distinction between two things that are very close

792
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
but on opposite sides of that cutoff point.

793
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I really think you have to look at it as a spectrum.

794
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I am fully willing to look at it as a spectrum.

795
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, but then the problem with that is that at no point on the spectrum

796
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
does the value become zero, except at the very end,

797
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
until you get to an inanimate object.

798
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So even if it's a spectrum, then even like a microbe

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
has some minuscule amount of value

800
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that should be taken under some minuscule amount of consideration.

801
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That is true.

802
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You never hit a cutoff point where you're like,

803
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
okay, under this, anything goes.

804
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But I think that...

805
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You just have to involve practicality.

806
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But that's what your emotional response

807
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
that telling you, oh, doing this to the cow is wrong.

808
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's what your emotional response is telling you,

809
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
like, oh, even though this cow is not as valuable as a human,

810
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it still has some value and I still have some empathy for it, right?

811
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Well, the empathy just comes from us assuming that it feels the same way about...

812
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, I'm saying that your logical response,

813
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
that your emotional response there makes logical sense

814
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
if you view it as like an intelligent spectrum.

815
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Only to some extent.

816
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The way it seems, Nate, is that you're going into these logical situations

817
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with the idea that if you were a robot and you didn't have any emotions,

818
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
this is what you would come to the conclusion with.

819
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This is what you would say.

820
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then, you know, on the other hand,

821
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
you have the reality that you wouldn't actually say that

822
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
because you are a human.

823
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And I don't know why you have that non-human robotic way of thinking

824
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
even in consideration because it can't happen right now.

825
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You're not a robot.

826
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It doesn't make any difference.

827
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Our law system already is a divorce from emotional stuff.

828
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We already have systems in place to do stuff like this.

829
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm sympathetic to the idea of viewing things unemotionally

830
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and trying to come to logical conclusions without bringing emotion into it.

831
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I think that makes sense.

832
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Emotion does not mean best, by the way.

833
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
We're trying to come to the best solution

834
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
which may or may not be our built-in human emotional response.

835
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You're trying to come to the best solution.

836
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We were just talking about our opinions.

837
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay, well, let me say one point that is two Gibbs points

838
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
to agree with what's Gibbs been saying.

839
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
All right, yeah, here it is.

840
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Okay, here's the thing, though.

841
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Given the reality of what human beings are,

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
if I met a man who told me that his hobby,

843
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
like he's a farmer or whatever,

844
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and he has cows, his hobby is to like drain the blood out of the cows

845
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and fill their veins with acid.

846
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He liked to do it because it was fun

847
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and he liked watching them scream and die.

848
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
If he told me that, you know, I would be,

849
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
my logic would still apply that, you know,

850
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
their lives don't matter,

851
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
but what does matter is the kind of human being

852
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
who would do that sort of thing

853
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is a psychopath,

854
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
is not a person who, you know,

855
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is a valuable member of the human race,

856
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
probably, probably, like they are a freak,

857
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and it is logical that they might also do those sorts of things

858
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to human beings.

859
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And so you can logically form from that position

860
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
like, okay, this guy has problems,

861
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't like him, I condemn his actions.

862
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
On that basis, you can still condemn, you know,

863
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
things that are clearly bad that we don't like,

864
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
even if, you know, like the things being tortured

865
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
are not inherently valuable.

866
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, I want to say something about that torture

867
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and the cow thing.

868
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The whole thing with the kosher meat being,

869
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you know, you have to cut it by the neck

870
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and drain its blood until it's all gone,

871
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and that's the only way Jews can eat that,

872
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and halal meat is very similar.

873
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And that I don't agree with

874
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
because to get the meat out of the cow,

875
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
you just need to kill it.

876
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And to torture it like that is just, you know,

877
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
it's a religious thing.

878
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You don't need to do that to get the meat out, though.

879
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If you gave a Jew something that wasn't kosher meat,

880
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
he wouldn't be able to tell.

881
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
He'd have no fucking idea.

882
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We could all agree that these kind of traditions are retarded.

883
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, traditions are retarded.

884
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So, like, what I would say is that if there's something like,

885
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
well, if you like beef, you have to kill a cow,

886
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and I'm like, hmm, well, I like beef.

887
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I like eating beef more than I care about

888
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
some cow I don't know dying.

889
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So I'm okay with it dying in the least harmful way possible

890
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because that's just the nicest thing to do

891
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
is just to hope that it's the least harmful possible

892
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and they're not being tortured.

893
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I think that's a lot of people's general stance,

894
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is they like meat,

895
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but they'd rather, you know, the cow lives a happy enough life

896
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and then dies instantly without feeling any pain.

897
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah, I'm on hippo's side on that one.

898
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You're definitely right.

899
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Everything dies eventually, you know?

900
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
If you give them a quick death,

901
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what have we really lost here, you know?

902
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I mean, everything should die.

903
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think dying will be eternal bliss.

904
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I just don't want to be tortured before I die

905
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and I think animals probably feel the same way.

906
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Do you think the cow will get 72 virgins in heaven, Momke?

907
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Is he a lull or not?

908
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, this cow prays five times a day.

909
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Did he strap a bunch of bombs to his oven

910
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and blow up the barn?

911
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He was gonna. He was just about to.

912
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If you don't do that, you don't get those virgins.

913
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Damn it.

914
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What if he died to feed some like ISIS fighters, you know,

915
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
like some real heroes?

916
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Is Muslim cow a friend of Action Draft?

917
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Absolutely. They're best friends.

918
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He's like, you know, as we all know,

919
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Action Draft is a globetrotting, you know, cinema superstar

920
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and Muslim cow is his, like, token racial friend

921
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that's in the movies.

922
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Muslim cow is down there in Pokemon Hell,

923
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
just real salty that he didn't quite get the chance

924
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
to carry out his terrorist attack.

925
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Holy shit, somebody draw Muslim cow.

926
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's my favorite character.

927
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The day before he was gonna do it.

928
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, I get it.

929
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It'd be like having a burqa on the cow

930
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
because it's a cow, because it's a milk female burqa.

931
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, yeah, I guess it would.

932
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It would look like a big black something or other,

933
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
like a rock, almost.

934
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I got a big black something or other for you, hippo.

935
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
God, I don't know.

936
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Okay, I feel like I got out pretty much my whole position

937
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
on this shit.

938
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Maybe there's some more specifics we can talk about.

939
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Anyone got any things that really upset them?

940
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I haven't said my position at all, and as the only vegetarian,

941
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I feel like I have some problems.

942
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh, that's right. I always forget that you're a vegetarian, Tom.

943
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I forgot I have no respect for you.

944
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, no, that's good.

945
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Okay, lay it down.

946
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's the whole thing.

947
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Despite the fact that I'm vegetarian,

948
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
it's not something I project out in the world,

949
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and that's why I'm happy that everyone forgets,

950
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
because that means I'm not making a big deal out of it,

951
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and that's a good sign.

952
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I guess you're doing it right.

953
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, right.

954
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
When people don't know, that's a good thing.

955
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
By the way, I do feel like it makes sense

956
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
for a lot of the emotional vegetarians

957
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
to project like, guys, you're killing cows.

958
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Stop it.

959
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Okay, but anyway, I'm sorry.

960
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I think that if that's your position,

961
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I just care about whether a person is consistent

962
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
in what they believe.

963
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't blame the crazy vegans out there,

964
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
because to them, they really think

965
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that all around them are mass murderers,

966
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and they're like, what's happening here?

967
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Where am I?

968
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I get it.

969
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
If that's your view, that's pretty fucked up.

970
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
They're wrong, though.

971
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Whatever.

972
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Well, I mean, my perspective is just that

973
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I think that ethical consideration shouldn't be given

974
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
on any basis of intelligence.

975
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It should be on the capacity to feel pain,

976
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
because you don't have to be intelligent to suffer.

977
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
If you're feeling pain, it's uncomfortable,

978
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
it sucks, and I don't like it.

979
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I don't know about you.

980
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I try to avoid pain as much as possible,

981
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
because I fucking hate it, because it's the worst.

982
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So I don't eat meat anymore,

983
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
because I'm uncomfortable.

984
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't try and have a meal or anything

985
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that I wouldn't be comfortable preparing,

986
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
start to finish myself in all the actions.

987
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So I don't have meat.

988
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I don't kill insects or shit.

989
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I try not to, at least.

990
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If there's a big spider in the house,

991
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and someone wants to kill it,

992
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll take it and bring it outside.

993
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I have this innate respect for life,

994
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and it doesn't make any logical sense.

995
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's not even probably the correct thing to do,

996
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but that's just my perspective.

997
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Can I hit you with a hypothetical on that one?

998
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Sure, go for it.

999
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So let's say you discover,

1000
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
there's a big old mouse in my house,

1001
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and he's tearing up my shit.

1002
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He's eating all my food.

1003
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Would you put a mouse trap,

1004
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
or would you just let him live there?

1005
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Because you can't catch that fucker.

1006
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He's running around like crazy.

1007
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That was actually going to be my next point.

1008
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There's exceptions when it comes to pests and stuff.

1009
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If you have a termite infection in your house,

1010
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and they're fucking everywhere,

1011
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
or you're infested with mice,

1012
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
because we've had mice in the house before,

1013
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
it's a little different,

1014
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
because now they're directly affecting your domicile,

1015
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and your health, essentially,

1016
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
because if you have an infestation,

1017
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
that can quickly spread disease and fuck you up.

1018
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
At that point, it comes under the same umbrella

1019
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
as self-defense.

1020
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
If a dude came to my house with a gun,

1021
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and tried to kill me,

1022
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'd be chill with killing him.

1023
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1024
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So it's the same thing with,

1025
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
if your fucking house is infested with shit,

1026
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and you're going to die,

1027
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
you've got to get rid of that, too.

1028
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
At the end of the day,

1029
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
again, kind of like what Ben was saying,

1030
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you put yourself first and shit like that,

1031
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but I tried to just go through life

1032
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and not cause harm in general,

1033
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
try to stay in my lane, so to speak,

1034
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
actualize myself to the best of my abilities

1035
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
without interfering with anyone or anything else intentionally.

1036
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So that's my general philosophy,

1037
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and that's why I don't eat meat anymore.

1038
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't kill bugs or mice or anything like that.

1039
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I try and keep that shit.

1040
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The thing with bugs is, I don't kill bugs either,

1041
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but usually because I can safely get them outside the house

1042
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
or they're not bothering me.

1043
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
If there's a spider in a very far corner of the attic or something,

1044
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
he can stay.

1045
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Spiders are people, too.

1046
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Spiders are people, too.

1047
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But if there's a spider on my computer,

1048
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
behind my computer, I'm like,

1049
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
eventually I'm going to have to go back there,

1050
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
so I have to get rid of this guy.

1051
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But killing him, there's going to be bug juice everywhere.

1052
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I don't want that.

1053
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So I don't kill things mostly because

1054
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
there's no benefit to me killing them,

1055
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
aside from a visceral reaction to stop something existing.

1056
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But generally, I like to not kill things

1057
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
unless there's no other way.

1058
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Didn't there used to be a soft drink called bug juice

1059
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that had cartoon characters on the lid?

1060
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Bug juice is a thing I had at Boy Scout Camp all the time,

1061
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
which was a cocktail of different fruit punch mixes and stuff.

1062
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It was never very good,

1063
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but they would just put whatever kind of juice shit they had around.

1064
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But they'd have Yu-Gi-Oh's head on it or some shit, right?

1065
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I can't speak to that. I don't know.

1066
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Does anybody remember that?

1067
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I don't even know what you're talking about,

1068
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
but I'll take your word for it.

1069
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I remember watching Kids WB

1070
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and there'd be commercials for bug juice all the time.

1071
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't know. I just know it's like a Boy Scout thing.

1072
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It sparked my nostalgia.

1073
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It sounds vaguely familiar,

1074
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
so maybe it exists.

1075
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I would ask Tom something about that, though,

1076
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
about his pain stuff.

1077
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's not really challenging you,

1078
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but I think I would just want to ask,

1079
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
to be the most consistent with your philosophy,

1080
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
would you say that the ideal version of that would be Jainism,

1081
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
which is this religion that is 100% focused

1082
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
on causing zero harm to any other living creature,

1083
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
to the point where they wear masks at all times

1084
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to avoid breathing in bugs

1085
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and accidentally swallowing them and killing them

1086
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
in that kind of way,

1087
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and they're always careful to not step on bugs or anything?

1088
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Would you say that's like the ultimate extreme?

1089
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't think that's going a little too far,

1090
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and the reason I think,

1091
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I always say when I explain my philosophy,

1092
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I always say it's like,

1093
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
maximize your own happiness

1094
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
without intentionally causing anybody else harm.

1095
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I think intentionally is really important

1096
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
because lots of the times,

1097
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
in order to maximize your own happiness,

1098
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
you have to unintentionally harm somebody else.

1099
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
An example I use a lot of the times

1100
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is if you're going for your dream job

1101
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and there's one position for it,

1102
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
in order to maximize your own happiness,

1103
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you've got to shit on someone else's dream

1104
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
by denying them the job.

1105
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
If you're in a situation where...

1106
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Doesn't make any sense.

1107
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Doesn't make any sense not to do it.

1108
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Then all of a sudden,

1109
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
you're basically causing yourself pain

1110
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and the whole point is to not cause pain.

1111
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So if you're causing yourself pain,

1112
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
in that situation,

1113
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
somebody's got to suffer.

1114
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It might as well be the other guy.

1115
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's what the capitalistic system makes more sense

1116
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
because you both try as hard as you can

1117
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and the one who is more capable

1118
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
gets rewarded and prospers,

1119
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and that's what we want.

1120
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
If there are unintentional consequences,

1121
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
as long as you're not intentionally

1122
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
or maliciously harming anybody else,

1123
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
it seems to be okay,

1124
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
because you're not...

1125
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I don't think it's okay

1126
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
to be like,

1127
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
if I didn't mean to do it,

1128
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
then it's all hunky-dory.

1129
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
There's obvious exceptions.

1130
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
If you fucking brutally murder somebody

1131
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
with your car,

1132
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
it's like, I didn't mean to do it,

1133
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I should just be able to go home.

1134
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There's degrees of stuff,

1135
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
but just as a general guideline,

1136
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
you're trying to do the best that you can

1137
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
without intentionally or maliciously hurting

1138
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
other people.

1139
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I feel like a good general standard

1140
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
is your life.

1141
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I agree so far as you can't

1142
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
really actively try...

1143
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
If it's unintentional,

1144
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it's unintentional.

1145
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You can't set out to do less

1146
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
unintentional harm

1147
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because the unintentional harm is outside your control.

1148
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And yet, unintentional harm

1149
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
is still just as bad as intentional harm.

1150
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So I don't know.

1151
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I feel like...

1152
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't think it's worth...

1153
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't think it's any worse

1154
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
than intentionally bad than to do it unintentionally

1155
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
in the game of things.

1156
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The reason that's incorrect is because

1157
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
when people do things intentionally wrong,

1158
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
that creates a pattern of behavior that you can

1159
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
use to determine what their actions are likely to be

1160
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
in the future.

1161
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You can say that they are both equally damaging

1162
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to the world, but you do know

1163
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
when something is intentional versus unintentional

1164
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
that that person is likely to continue

1165
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
this kind of action, whereas if it was intentional,

1166
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
that's not the case.

1167
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Despite the effects being the same,

1168
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I think intentional is always worse

1169
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
for you.

1170
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
If I'm talking more like a code of conduct

1171
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and less for physical ramifications

1172
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
on the rest of the world,

1173
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and that's where I think

1174
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that distinction becomes important.

1175
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
To go back to the job example,

1176
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
there's a difference between me

1177
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
going in for an interview and then you going in for an interview

1178
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and you winning out over me.

1179
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That was you just being the better candidate

1180
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
or whatever. That's unintentional harm.

1181
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But if we talked

1182
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
on the train and we're both going for the same job

1183
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and you fucking made sure that

1184
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I didn't get off the train at the right time

1185
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
so I missed my interview and you got the job by default,

1186
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that's intentional harm.

1187
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You know that that guy is a bad dude, right?

1188
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You know if he's done that.

1189
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We're aware that this is a shady person and we don't want them

1190
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
doing that.

1191
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I'm pretty confused because I've never seen a cow

1192
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
go into a job interview.

1193
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
We're kind of moving away from animal rights.

1194
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Haven't you read the far side dude?

1195
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Oh yeah, you're right.

1196
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Belly washers.

1197
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The drink was called belly washers.

1198
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
On the subject of meat,

1199
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I want to say something like

1200
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
some people will say

1201
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
some people will be like, yeah,

1202
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I know it's bad that the cow gets killed for this meat

1203
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
but the cow is already dead

1204
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
so it's not bad if I eat it.

1205
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That's so stupid.

1206
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And I don't agree with that because it's supply and demand.

1207
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
If you're buying the meat,

1208
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
you're contributing to the demand

1209
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and you're indirectly but you're still

1210
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
supporting this

1211
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
system.

1212
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
That's why I don't do it.

1213
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
In terms of

1214
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
practicality, it's like, yeah,

1215
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
the deed's already done and you're just

1216
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
consuming flesh but at the same time

1217
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
you're contributing to the system.

1218
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You're leading to it happening more.

1219
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
My mindset is that

1220
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
if I was doing that myself,

1221
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I would be uncomfortable with it and therefore I don't participate.

1222
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But it gets a little more

1223
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
complicated to me at least

1224
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
when you think about the fact that

1225
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the cows that are being

1226
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
slaughtered for this meat are being

1227
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
bred specifically for that

1228
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
purpose.

1229
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Their life wouldn't even exist without this demand,

1230
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
right?

1231
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah, in a sense.

1232
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So that's where I get a little, oh man,

1233
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
it's too tough.

1234
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They're still living creature and they're still feeling pain.

1235
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What is the net?

1236
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Are we talking about that? That's when it gets tough.

1237
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
How do you measure goodness?

1238
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Do you judge it by net life

1239
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
enjoyed by all creatures on the planet?

1240
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You don't. You don't measure it.

1241
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Every baby that we do not have,

1242
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
everyone should be out fucking all the time

1243
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
to produce more humans to have more

1244
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
enjoyment. You don't measure it.

1245
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That's not a thing that you do.

1246
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You don't measure it but I'm talking about systems where we do.

1247
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But if you're trying to come up

1248
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
with a schema of what

1249
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
is good and what

1250
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
is a world worth pursuing.

1251
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I thought we were talking about cows though.

1252
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
These are all relevant questions.

1253
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Keep it to cows.

1254
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Keep it to cows. Talk about what could be good

1255
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
or about cows.

1256
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I think Nate's baby example is germane.

1257
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Well, it doesn't matter

1258
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
because it also applies to cows.

1259
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh wait, germane means good. I forgot.

1260
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So just to

1261
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
apply it to cows, if we got two cows

1262
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
and you don't eat meat

1263
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
so you just let them live out their lives

1264
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and they die, let's say they don't have kids or whatever,

1265
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
then that's fine.

1266
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But if you are a meat farmer

1267
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and you take those two cows and you breed them

1268
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and you make a whole fucking fleet of cows

1269
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
by the end. And so let's say you've got

1270
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
like a thousand cows now.

1271
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
But after, you know, how long does the cow live?

1272
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Let's say after like five years,

1273
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you slaughter them and kill them. Maybe that's a lot shorter.

1274
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't know. But you slaughter them and you kill them.

1275
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And let's say you do it in a generally humane way

1276
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
not like torturing them like the Jews love to do.

1277
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And

1278
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
you kill them and you sell it and whatever.

1279
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So in that equation, the one guy

1280
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
had like two cows and they had a great life.

1281
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
You lived with them. They were like your pets.

1282
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
They were your buddies. And then they died

1283
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
as opposed to a world where you've got now

1284
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
a thousand cows who all had pretty good lives

1285
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
but they did end violently as they were killed.

1286
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So like which of those

1287
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
is a happier situation for the world?

1288
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I mean,

1289
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
well, I'm not talking about the world.

1290
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think it's happier because now people have

1291
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
things to eat.

1292
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, let's just focus on the cows lives.

1293
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's definitely the first situation.

1294
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I don't know, man.

1295
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I think there's something.

1296
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
If a thousand cows

1297
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
live okay lives versus two cows

1298
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
living good lives,

1299
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
maybe the thousand had more

1300
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
to bind good lives.

1301
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We're talking about, I don't think,

1302
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I guess maybe my differentiation here is like

1303
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I don't think quantity

1304
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
has anything to do with it.

1305
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, why would the...

1306
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That can't be true because benefiting

1307
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
two people is better than benefiting one,

1308
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
isn't it?

1309
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Can I just say, why?

1310
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
God fucking dammit!

1311
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Can I say what I want to say?

1312
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Jesus Christ!

1313
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Why would one thousand cows

1314
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
live worse lives than just two?

1315
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Why is that part of it?

1316
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
No, it's just because we kill them at the end.

1317
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We kill them for meat after several years.

1318
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Is that it? Yeah, that's it.

1319
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I thought dying of old age is also painful.

1320
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It probably is.

1321
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Then what's the difference?

1322
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The time that was lived between the two?

1323
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Those two had a higher quality life overall.

1324
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They lived, let's say, 10 years.

1325
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
This is like a hypothetical scenario

1326
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
we're laying out here. No, this is totally

1327
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
applicable to real life.

1328
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
We're talking about how we should treat animals.

1329
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Well, okay.

1330
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Why is it okay to

1331
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
arbitrarily kill something

1332
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
after it's been deemed by someone

1333
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
else that their function has been served

1334
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
now they're going to keep going?

1335
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Well, you could argue that it isn't.

1336
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I don't because I don't care about cows' lives.

1337
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That's my position.

1338
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You do, obviously.

1339
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I think that's kind of ridiculous.

1340
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
It's like saying,

1341
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
what if the state took care of me and my family

1342
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
and I had seven kids but once I turned

1343
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
40 they fucking killed me and used my body

1344
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
for medical purposes?

1345
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Just to Ben's point, Ben was just making a question

1346
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
about which of those is a better world?

1347
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Which world has produced more joy?

1348
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Well, if all the cows had

1349
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
a decent life, then by virtue

1350
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
of the more cows having more of a good life,

1351
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
they all add up to

1352
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
something gooder. I don't know how you're measuring this.

1353
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
We're talking about

1354
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
1,000 cows whose lives is

1355
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
not great, but it's

1356
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
just good enough that it's not

1357
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
terrible.

1358
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's just worth living versus one cow that had

1359
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
like, yeah, this cow had a good ass life.

1360
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You know what I mean?

1361
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What do you mean why? This is the hypothetical

1362
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
that I'm laying out.

1363
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Fine, that's the hypothetical. I thought it was a different hypothetical.

1364
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
But if that's the hypothetical,

1365
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I would say

1366
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that's stacked in favour of

1367
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
the two cows having a great life.

1368
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But I'm just saying, if there's two cows

1369
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
and they die of old age, and if you have 1,000 cows

1370
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
that get killed, if they still

1371
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
have a decent life,

1372
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
it's better

1373
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
to have more cows because

1374
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
there's more meat and that

1375
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
impacts more people

1376
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
than two cows that don't give any meat.

1377
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Even if we're talking about just the cows,

1378
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't think it makes too much of a difference

1379
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
if there's 1,000 cows or two cows

1380
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
unless you explicitly say that

1381
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
the two cows have a much better life.

1382
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Which is why I think it's a weird hypothetical

1383
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
that there's only one answer to that.

1384
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Of course it's the two cows.

1385
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Alright, to me

1386
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
it seems obvious

1387
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
that 1,000 cows

1388
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
from a logical standpoint,

1389
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
1,000 cows living mediocre lives

1390
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
is probably more happiness

1391
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
overall than one or two cows

1392
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
living real good lives. But hey,

1393
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
that's just a theory.

1394
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
A game theory.

1395
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Thanks for watching.

1396
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I think from that

1397
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
sense of logic, I think

1398
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
we should be making as many people as possible

1399
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and making as many cows as possible.

1400
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That's the logical application.

1401
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You could also say that because all those cows die

1402
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and that's sad, that we should have no cows,

1403
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
we should have no people, we should have absolutely nothing

1404
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
because then there'll be no sadness in the world,

1405
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
there'll be no pain, there'll be no death.

1406
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I don't see how any of this fits together.

1407
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm getting really heated right now.

1408
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
To go back to

1409
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
my original point

1410
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
which is what I guess we were trying to talk about

1411
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm thinking more along the lines of

1412
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
not enabling happiness

1413
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
because I don't think there's any way

1414
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to guarantee happiness

1415
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
at least for human beings

1416
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
that's up to you.

1417
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You can only set up potential

1418
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
for happiness but it's your own actions

1419
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
in terms of whether you're happy or not.

1420
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
The kind of philosophy I follow

1421
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
is about avoiding causing pain

1422
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and by that extension

1423
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
avoiding suffering.

1424
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Tom, can I challenge your philosophy

1425
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
with another question?

1426
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah, I'm down to discuss. Go.

1427
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So plants and fish

1428
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
are very similar in that neither feel pain

1429
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and you have to kill both of them to eat them

1430
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
so why do you not eat fish?

1431
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I've asked myself that question

1432
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I think it's because

1433
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
that's much more of just

1434
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
a personal discomfort

1435
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
because they're still alive and I wouldn't want to deny

1436
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
something like that. But isn't a plant alive too?

1437
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I think it's just that fish

1438
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
have eyes and we have eyes.

1439
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I've thought about that a lot because it's like

1440
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
by that same philosophy it is still hypocritical

1441
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
to have plants. You'd have to subsist basically on nothing

1442
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
by nuts and berries essentially.

1443
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Nuts have lives. Nuts have potential for lives.

1444
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And as

1445
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Sonnet you discovered after he evolved

1446
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
with his new body, nuts and apples

1447
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
just won't cut it.

1448
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Is that true though? Do fish not feel pain?

1449
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
How do we know that? I've heard that.

1450
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
They're not smart enough to feel pain.

1451
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I just read it.

1452
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Let's just assume that that's true. I'm pretty sure it is.

1453
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I've heard it before as well.

1454
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's either a very popular myth or

1455
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
there's some science somewhere.

1456
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Even if we put in a hypothetical animal that's like that though

1457
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
we could still...

1458
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Personally, the fact that fish don't feel pain

1459
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
say if I was

1460
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
vegetarian or vegetarian, I would still

1461
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
not eat fish just because of that emotional

1462
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
attachment.

1463
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Because they have eyes and a mouth and I'm like

1464
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
it's a guy, it's a person.

1465
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I can very easily anthropomorphize a fish.

1466
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's very difficult to anthropomorphize

1467
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
a plant without making it

1468
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
an animal with plant-like qualities.

1469
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
At the end of the day, this philosophy

1470
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
completely

1471
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
comes into conflict with

1472
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
the structure of how life on this planet works.

1473
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Sure.

1474
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
We're all designed to

1475
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
the entire planet

1476
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
is basically one

1477
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
macro-organism where we're all parts of it

1478
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and that means we all are interdependent.

1479
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You can only resist this to a certain degree

1480
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
unless you just want to give up yourself and die

1481
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and then kind of go back into the soil

1482
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
and become fuel for something else.

1483
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's inherently flawed.

1484
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
The ultimate act of vegetarianism is suicide.

1485
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's not even

1486
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
a joke when you really get

1487
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
super deep into it.

1488
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This is why I don't go out and evangelize it

1489
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
or try to make a big deal out of it

1490
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
because to do it is definitely an act of hypocrisy

1491
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
to a degree

1492
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
the farther you go down that path.

1493
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Tom, it sounds to me

1494
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
what you're saying is at the logical end

1495
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
of vegetarianism lies

1496
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
this rejection

1497
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
of the systems that keep human beings alive

1498
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
or allows

1499
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
that's possibly true

1500
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
along the vegetarian lifestyle.

1501
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I would challenge the vegetarian

1502
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
ideology at its core

1503
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
because I think that

1504
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and my whole argument at the beginning of this podcast

1505
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
was a challenge to

1506
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
why they think the way they do

1507
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and why I don't think that it is necessary

1508
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
to concern ourselves with the lives of animals

1509
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
at least to the extent that vegetarians do

1510
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
or vegans or those guys who take it to that extreme.

1511
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Living itself

1512
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
is kind of a selfish thing to do

1513
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
because to keep yourself alive

1514
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
you have to consume resources

1515
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and if you get a job

1516
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
it doesn't get that job

1517
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
it's a bitter struggle for resources

1518
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
and position and status

1519
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and money and sex and all that stuff

1520
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
and

1521
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
that's why I really think that

1522
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
if you don't

1523
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
to live at all

1524
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
is to look out for number one

1525
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
above all else

1526
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and if you don't acknowledge that

1527
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I really think you're just kidding yourself.

1528
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Not to suck my own dick too hard

1529
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
so I think the only difference between

1530
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
our two positions here

1531
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
is that we both accept that living is

1532
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
a fairly selfish thing to do in general

1533
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
so we agree on that

1534
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
but you seem to be

1535
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
okay at pretty much leaving it at that

1536
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
whereas I am interested in continuing on

1537
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
to try to

1538
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
investigate the ideal situation

1539
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
where we're causing the least harm possible

1540
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
that's what I'm interested in from you

1541
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I am totally content with leaving it at that

1542
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
there you go

1543
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
that was pretty juicy

1544
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
anybody got any more points to make?

1545
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I'll pull them up but anybody got any

1546
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
more points to make?

1547
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I think frogs should take over as the main

1548
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
species on earth

1549
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
we have stupid podcasts that suck

1550
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and they

1551
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
they've really shot themselves

1552
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
in the foot by making those

1553
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I think me and Tom

1554
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
need to go out to dinner and he needs to

1555
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
prepare me the greatest vegetarian

1556
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
meal of all time

1557
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
well then fuck

1558
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Tom is good

1559
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Tom accepts the vegetarian lifestyle as shit

1560
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
but he doesn't anyway

1561
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I was almost sold

1562
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
that's the weird thing

1563
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I know some good vegetarian things

1564
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I like a lot of vegetarian foods

1565
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
there are good vegetarian meals I'm just a terrible vegetarian

1566
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I actually like tofu

1567
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
you know the thing

1568
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
you don't even miss for me

1569
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I didn't even bring this up at all but I actually

1570
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
would love to be a vegetarian

1571
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
for the nutritional benefits

1572
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
if you're a vegetarian you will

1573
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
not be fat you just won't be

1574
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
fat it's not gonna happen

1575
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
unless you're like a shitty one

1576
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
no come on

1577
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
you can eat high fructose

1578
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
corn syrup as a vegetarian

1579
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
right yeah I'm revising that

1580
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
here's the thing you can do for a vegetarian meal

1581
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
you get a bunch of vegetables

1582
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and some olive oil and you put it all in a

1583
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
pan you just chop it up a bit onions

1584
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
peppers asparagus all sorts

1585
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
of things you put them in a pan

1586
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and you just roast it you roast that for like

1587
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
an hour or so and it's just great

1588
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
no hypocrite sucks roast it there you go

1589
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
but that just sounds like a side dish

1590
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
like I'd still be hungry for them

1591
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
no no it's a big deal because of the olive oil

1592
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
dude just get a chili and olive oil

1593
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and garlic and pepper and all that

1594
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
haven't you ever had like

1595
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
haven't you ever had like vegetarian noodles

1596
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
at like a Chinese place with delicious sauce

1597
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it's purely vegetarian but it's fucking delicious

1598
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and it's like a big ass entree type meal

1599
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I love those those are totally vegetarian

1600
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
pasta noodle dishes with

1601
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
vegetables are great

1602
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Nate the only food I eat is fried chicken

1603
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
now you're speaking my language

1604
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
would you

1605
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
my snapchat is like

1606
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
half just like videos of me frying

1607
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
shit

1608
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
have you ever like

1609
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
eaten just the fried part of like

1610
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
the skin like all the fucking time

1611
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I feel that I first need it

1612
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
yeah maybe that's the only good

1613
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
bit maybe you should just eat that part

1614
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
yeah but they don't have extra

1615
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
yeah I'm a vegetarian I buy

1616
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
chicken wings and I cook them but I only

1617
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
eat the skin and I throw the rest to my dogs

1618
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
yeah

1619
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
makes perfect sense

1620
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I just feel more comfortable that way

1621
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
okay let's

1622
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
let's answer some of these questions here

1623
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
okay here we go

1624
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
at tbob806

1625
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
asks how do you guys deal

1626
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
with stress

1627
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
is there really any good way

1628
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
to deal with stress

1629
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I don't know it if there is

1630
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
the main way I deal with stress

1631
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
is to not worry about people seeing me

1632
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
get angry because if you worry about

1633
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
that it's just an extra layer

1634
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
an extra layer being embarrassed about your feelings

1635
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
is retarded I know how Gib deals with

1636
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
stress though Gib goes into

1637
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Dark Souls and kills an NPC

1638
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
that's how he lets off steam

1639
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I like that system a lot

1640
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
my reaction to stress

1641
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
is to shut down

1642
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and go catatonic and not do anything

1643
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
imagine Ben lying on the floor

1644
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
emotionless

1645
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
stress

1646
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
does it work

1647
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
no

1648
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
that's not my coping

1649
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
that's my natural reaction

1650
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
it's me sitting at my computer

1651
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
staring at a screen picking at my hair

1652
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
just for hours

1653
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
that's my stress reaction

1654
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
the best coping mechanism

1655
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
that I have with it is to

1656
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
fight through it and do something anyway

1657
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and usually that makes me feel better

1658
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
but of course easier said than done

1659
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
accomplishing one of the things

1660
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
on your task list when you're stressed

1661
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
is I think the best way

1662
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
it's also the most difficult thing to do

1663
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
it's really hard

1664
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
you're least motivated

1665
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
it's why you need to have a bunch

1666
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
of shitty projects that don't matter

1667
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
like I have with the

1668
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
risker drawings like I'm still doing

1669
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
if I can't think of anything to do

1670
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I do that and I feel okay

1671
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
if I get to the end of a day and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything

1672
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'll like make a t-shirt

1673
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
and that will be like

1674
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
oh I did something today

1675
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
okay what do we got here

1676
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
how about at based

1677
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
anime man says

1678
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
wait no it's a terrible question never mind

1679
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
okay here's a better one at our hero

1680
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
our good friend hgbguy

1681
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
asks this incredible question

1682
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
you may only choose one

1683
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
chicken or tea

1684
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
that's your question

1685
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I'd choose tea by default

1686
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I would be really sad to lose

1687
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
either one

1688
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
well I can have coffees

1689
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
who cares tea at chicken

1690
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
my gut reaction is that

1691
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'd really miss chicken but on the other hand

1692
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
like other meats are good as well

1693
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
whereas there's really no good substitute

1694
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
for tea

1695
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Ben do you make chicken nuggets

1696
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
out of a different animal

1697
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
actually you make chicken tendis

1698
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
out of a different animal

1699
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
can you make buffalo wild wings out of a different animal

1700
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I just yesterday watched

1701
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
a video of

1702
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Chef John from foodwishes.com

1703
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
preparing what he called city chicken

1704
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
which is just pork arranged

1705
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
to look like a chicken wing

1706
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and supposedly it's pretty good

1707
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
so maybe I guess I would give up chicken actually

1708
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
now that you said it

1709
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
fuck you

1710
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm kicking you guys out of the chicken nuggets

1711
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
fan club

1712
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I would definitely give up

1713
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I like tea but I don't need it

1714
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
speaking of chicken nuggets you hear about the guy who got

1715
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
the year of free nuggets from Wendy's

1716
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
did he get all those tweets

1717
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
did he get all the retweets

1718
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
he has the most

1719
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
he didn't get 18 million but I think it got

1720
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
like 4 million or something it's the most retweeted

1721
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
tweet of all time

1722
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
did he have that agreement

1723
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
ahead of time or like what was the arrangement

1724
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
here did he just tweet like hey if I get

1725
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
a million tweets what he did is he

1726
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
he tweeted at Wendy's and said how many retweets

1727
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
do I need to get a year's supply

1728
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
free nuggets and they responded 18 million

1729
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
so he quoted that

1730
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and said helping to get out I need my nugs

1731
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
yeah

1732
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
and he got like 4.5 million tweets and it was the most

1733
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
retweeted tweet of all time so Wendy's is like

1734
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
you know what we'll give it to you

1735
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
that's fucking great that's fantastic

1736
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that almost makes up for the porn

1737
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
the Wendy's porn yeah

1738
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
yeah

1739
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
wait I feel like I was gonna say

1740
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
oh yeah the one misgiving

1741
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
the one last misgiving I have about giving up chicken

1742
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
is that chicken breast is like the cheapest

1743
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
meat like all other meats

1744
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
are more expensive than chicken

1745
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
that's what would make me sad about giving up chicken

1746
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I feel like a lot of the time

1747
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
fried chicken it's mostly

1748
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
in the batter and I can do it

1749
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
with other meat

1750
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I probably could

1751
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
nothing beats chicken nuggets

1752
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
with buffalo sauce baby

1753
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
you can't beat it

1754
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
some of that honey mustard

1755
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
sauce

1756
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
you gotta give up tea

1757
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
who gives a fuck about tea

1758
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
yeah

1759
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I drink tea every day

1760
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and even I know chicken

1761
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I mean how are you gonna bulk without chicken

1762
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
come on

1763
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I enjoy chicken more often than I enjoy tea

1764
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I should give up the tea

1765
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
it's better than tea

1766
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I like it

1767
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
but I've already done this in giving up chicken

1768
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
that's true

1769
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
there's so many different kinds of tea

1770
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
so many different kinds of chicken

1771
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I think

1772
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I could probably

1773
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
if I wanted to give up meat entirely

1774
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
it wasn't that hard

1775
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I did it in one day

1776
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Jesus Christ

1777
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
how long have you been a veg man

1778
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think seven years now

1779
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
seven years

1780
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
now Tom this is an important question

1781
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I forgot to ask

1782
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
as a vegetarian do you still eat pussy

1783
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
you know

1784
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
that is my one flaw

1785
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I suppose

1786
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
on the rare occasions I'm allowed

1787
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
you hypocrite

1788
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
okay here's another question

1789
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
hey guys do you think

1790
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
vegetarian women still swallow cum

1791
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
yes

1792
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
better

1793
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
if a cow could talk

1794
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and would say like

1795
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
take my milk go for it no problem

1796
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
swallow my cum dude

1797
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
swallow my cum

1798
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
okay here we go

1799
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
at Gergerad

1800
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
says what is the ideal

1801
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
breakfast of champions

1802
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
especially excited to hear a hypocrite

1803
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and his take on English breakfast

1804
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
also his name is toasty boy

1805
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
is the breakfast of champions

1806
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
in reference to anything

1807
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
what's your favorite breakfast

1808
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
that was the slogan for weedies for a while

1809
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
right that's true

1810
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
weedies is not involved in my breakfast of champions

1811
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I occasionally have

1812
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
an English breakfast

1813
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
with tomatoes

1814
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and mushrooms

1815
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
and toast and bacon

1816
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm into that

1817
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
it's all nice and greasy and cool

1818
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
but I don't have it every day

1819
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
because it's a lot of stuff to do

1820
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
but yeah

1821
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
English breakfast is my favorite

1822
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't know if

1823
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
yeah English breakfast is good

1824
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
every breakfast you eat is an English breakfast

1825
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I don't know if this is the best

1826
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
well, Nate

1827
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I have two breakfast stories

1828
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
one is

1829
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
we went one year to like

1830
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Connecticut or something and we stayed at this

1831
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
weirdly fancy hotel

1832
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
we were in this hotel that was

1833
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
really fancy for some reason

1834
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I think I do remember that

1835
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
yeah

1836
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
and there was like a big like painted mural

1837
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
on the ceiling of the foyer or whatever

1838
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
anyway it was advertised

1839
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
that there was free breakfast

1840
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
like free continental breakfast meaning like

1841
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
some fucking danishes and coffee

1842
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
and like a little like sealed

1843
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
pouch of cereal or whatever

1844
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
but I went to like this other room by accident

1845
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
it was like a restaurant in the thing

1846
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and I ordered Lobster Eggs

1847
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Benedict thinking that

1848
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I remember that

1849
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
thinking that this was the free breakfast

1850
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
and they gave it to me

1851
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and then they were like yeah $35

1852
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I was like I'm just a kid

1853
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't have any money

1854
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
and then like I don't know

1855
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I went and got mom or something

1856
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and like she was like

1857
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I think they gave it to me for free

1858
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
because like I was a kid

1859
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
so that was one of the best breakfast I ever had

1860
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
the other one, okay the other day

1861
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
a couple days before I left Digi House

1862
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
we went out to Waffle House together

1863
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and Waffle House is kind of

1864
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
is kind of pricey for what it is

1865
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
like the food's not great

1866
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
it's kind of shitty and it's not that cheap

1867
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
but you can like

1868
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
hash browns are like $1.75

1869
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and a triple serving of hash browns

1870
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
is like less than three times

1871
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
it's like $3 and you can get a topping

1872
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
for like 50 cents a piece

1873
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and one of the toppings is sausage gravy

1874
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
so go to Waffle House

1875
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
get a triple hash browns

1876
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
with sausage gravy and it is a huge

1877
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
fucking bowl of hash brown

1878
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
smothered in like

1879
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
ladles full of sausage gravy

1880
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I was stuffed and it cost me like $3.75

1881
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
that sounds amazing

1882
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
it was amazing

1883
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
everyone try it

1884
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
that sounds pretty good

1885
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
go and rip off your local Waffle House

1886
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
by the way I fucking love sausage gravy

1887
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and I hate that they don't eat it

1888
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
above the Mason Dixon line

1889
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
yeah we do

1890
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I like never had it

1891
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
in life until I was like an adult

1892
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
we grew up in fucking Massachusetts

1893
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
every gas station would have

1894
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
biscuits and gravy available

1895
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
to eat and they had sausage gravy

1896
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
they don't have it around Boston

1897
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
yeah biscuits and gravy was not a thing

1898
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
around Boston

1899
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
you could get it at KFC

1900
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but not like sausage gravy

1901
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
it was like shitty

1902
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I remembered my actual

1903
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
favorite breakfast I ever had

1904
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
it sounds weird but it's

1905
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
cold salmon

1906
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
like cold salmon fish

1907
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
with

1908
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
scrambled eggs

1909
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but put in the microwave

1910
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
it's very strange

1911
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
but it's really nice

1912
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
like cold salmon and hot

1913
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
microwaved scrambled eggs

1914
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
delicious if you have that

1915
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
that reminds me of another breakfast favor

1916
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
but it also worked good for brunch or lunch

1917
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
which is a bagel with cream cheese

1918
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
capers, onions, tomato slices

1919
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
and thin sliced smoked salmon

1920
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
or the locks bagel

1921
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
is one of my other favorite breakfast

1922
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
but you gotta have the capers

1923
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
the capers really make the meal

1924
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
trust me

1925
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I wanna hear what you guys think of this one

1926
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
for the breakfast of a true champion

1927
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you sleep until noon

1928
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
and then you eat lunch

1929
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I got breakfast of champions

1930
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I was gonna say I don't have breakfast

1931
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I intermittent fast but I also sleep all day

1932
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
regardless of when I wake up

1933
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
wait that's not the dietary intermittent fasting

1934
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
of like the professional bodybuilders

1935
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
that's not what you're talking about

1936
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I eat for an 8 hour period

1937
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I fast for 16 on the daily

1938
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and do you do this for like

1939
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
the weight loss?

1940
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
that's how I heard about it

1941
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
but I just do it because

1942
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
like fuck why not it's easy

1943
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I kinda do the same thing where

1944
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I'll eat for 16 hours and then for 8 hours

1945
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I won't

1946
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
you talk about 18 hours

1947
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
16 hours straight

1948
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
like that's a big meal

1949
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
no no just like you know every now and then

1950
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like sometimes they eat breakfast and lunch and dinner

1951
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
like these random little meals throughout the day

1952
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and then 8 hours no eating at all

1953
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I don't understand what you're talking about

1954
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
he's saying that he eats throughout the day

1955
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and then goes to sleep

1956
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I fast when I'm asleep

1957
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
it's a fucking joke

1958
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Tyrone likes to pyramid his meals

1959
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
meaning each meal is bigger than the last

1960
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I met Tyrone's dad the other day

1961
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
he was a short Mexican guy

1962
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Tyrone's 6 foot 10 and 300 pounds

1963
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
what?

1964
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
that's some donkey

1965
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
here's a question

1966
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
at Vivian Flamer

1967
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
at Vivian Flamer asks

1968
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
will you validate me by answering my humorous question

1969
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
that leaves little room for discussion

1970
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
towards the end of your podcast please

1971
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000

1973
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
at anime

1974
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
people have weird names

1975
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
maybe it is

1976
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
oh yeah that's probably it

1977
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
oh you got it good job

1978
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
have you ever had any paranormal

1979
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
or otherwise inexplicable

1980
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000

thing happen to you

1985
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
or just inexplicable

1986
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I went to Pokemon hell

1987
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
how was it

1988
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
it was hot

1989
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I left

1990
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
it hurts a lot

1991
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
trust me

1992
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I had a ghost

1993
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I had a ghost

1994
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
so my college

1995
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
was real gay

1996
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I guess it was

1997
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
the most haunted college

1998
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
in New Jersey

1999
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
it had some shitty little claim to fame

2000
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
there were a couple of local ghosts

2001
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
in different buildings

2002
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
when I

2003
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
first got there as a freshman

2004
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
they had a thing

2005
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
there was like a raffle

2006
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
to see who got to go on this ghost

2007
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
tour

2008
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
where a tour guide would go around and talk about the ghost

2009
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and like oh my god this is a fucking

2010
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
tale

2011
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
we went around to different places

2012
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
oh this is the ghost that supposedly he is here

2013
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and we went up to the top of this

2014
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
administrative building

2015
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
that is not a normal place

2016
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
to go

2017
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and we were standing up in this kind of

2018
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
conference room with windows

2019
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
and

2020
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
he is talking about the ghost

2021
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
he is talking about a ghost of a woman

2022
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
who died

2023
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
and there is a lightning flash

2024
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
someone takes a picture in a camera

2025
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
and I swear to god

2026
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
reflected in the window in this room

2027
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I see the image

2028
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
of an old man in a poncho

2029
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
standing next to a little boy

2030
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
that looks an awful lot like a ghost

2031
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and I was like hey excuse me

2032
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I just saw a ghost in the mirror

2033
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I saw the ghostly image of an old man

2034
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
in a poncho standing with a little boy

2035
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
and he was like oh no that is not the ghost that lives here

2036
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and I was okay never mind don't worry about it

2037
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
it is fine

2038
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
and then

2039
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
some fucking goth chick

2040
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
was like uh

2041
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
got all spooked and she was sitting on a radiator

2042
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and she was like uh and she kind of made a scene

2043
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
about it and the tour guide was like

2044
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
it is and she was like oh I felt something

2045
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
but you know I'm very receptive to the spirits

2046
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
you know I talk to ghosts

2047
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I talk to ghosts all the time

2048
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
and then yeah and then she went on this big stupid thing

2049
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
about her retarded beliefs or whatever

2050
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
was it not because she sat on a hot radion

2051
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
she went ah

2052
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
she fucking she faked the whole

2053
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
goddamn thing for attention

2054
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
that son of a bitch

2055
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I need to ask so how

2056
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
convinced are you that what you experienced there was a

2057
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
paranormal event

2058
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
20%

2059
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
okay that is what I wanted to hear

2060
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I had a real one

2061
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
if you want to hear my real paranormal event

2062
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
sure sure sure

2063
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
so one time me and my buddies we went to

2064
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Red Lobster and you know like they

2065
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
for some reason in all these fucking places

2066
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
you know Yorda Crab Legs or Lobster

2067
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
they don't take the meat out for you

2068
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
they are like here here is a $25

2069
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
shore for you have fun

2070
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
so I got all the meat out of my Lobster

2071
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
and I had this shell sitting over there

2072
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
and I found a bit and I think

2073
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
there was a ghost in the shell

2074
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
wow

2075
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
fuck all of you

2076
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
rap events gay bullshit

2077
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and not my hilarious meme

2078
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
you just put the words

2079
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
of a thing that everyone knows

2080
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
it was just it was all just a shaggy dog

2081
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
story

2082
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'm starting my new podcast

2083
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm starting the pro labs and gators

2084
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
podcast

2085
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
there's a question that's not purely

2086
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
this is a purely a vanity question

2087
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
a facu

2088
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
at facacababaca

2089
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
god damn it

2090
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I don't know whatever

2091
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
facucabobaca asks how do you like your steak

2092
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
and I'm only answering this because I just had

2093
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
the best steak in my whole life two weeks ago

2094
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
at this rip my parents came to visit in Cincinnati

2095
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and we went to this place called the precinct

2096
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
for the first time in my life they want to go to a fancy restaurant

2097
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
so I got this

2098
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
reservation at the place I never believed

2099
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,340
There was such a thing as a good restaurant. I assumed everything was McDonald's quality or worse

2100
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:22,520
And I got to this place and we had this it's famous for its steaks like a Cincinnati famous restaurant and

2101
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:28,460
Had the fucking steak and it was just the literally the best meal I've ever had in my entire life

2102
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,460
And it was I believe

2103
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:37,040
Medium no it was medium rare. Yeah, it was me. I think medium rare is the way to go with stay

2104
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,580
It was it was pink and juicy and so fucking succulent. Yeah, everyone go to the precinct

2105
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,840
It's not a steak, but I just went to a place called Moxie burger yesterday

2106
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:56,040
Which I'd never been to before and ordered the classic Moxie burger, which is it's a burger medium rare with bacon

2107
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:02,600
like a cheese sauce some other like spicy aioli sauce on it or something and a fried green tomato and

2108
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,200
I'd never had a fried green tomato before it kind of tastes like a pickle. Anyway, it was super good and

2109
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:16,000
Medium rare medium medium rare is the point. Oh, I just I just thought of a cool thing to say. There's a good be a hashtag

2110
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,600
Liking well done steak is the equivalent of liking Dark Souls 2

2111
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:28,600
That's a comparison. I thought it's quite apt because people people garbage. Yeah, no people

2112
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:36,080
It's mostly because people have come out and said, you know, I think well done steak is the best and I'm like, well

2113
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,080
It isn't you just like it

2114
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,720
So you're you're dumb. I

2115
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:45,200
Agreed. Okay. Here we go. He decky camea said that as a boy

2116
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:51,280
He would eat steak but his but he would eat American steak only he couldn't understand all the words like he couldn't fully

2117
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:58,000
Appreciate the taste of the American steak which inspired him which inspired him to make his own steak as an adult and like

2118
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:05,200
Deliberately leave out some of like the key ingredients so that the so that the player of the steak had to like piece the story together in their own minds

2119
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,240
But you said he decky camea. What you mean is he did talking me is a I'm fucking

2120
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:15,920
I was quite lost there. Yeah, fuck me now. Sorry. That's his first name. Whatever. Who cares to me is a key

2121
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,920
Okay, here's a here's another question. Okay, this is a this is one

2122
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:26,280
I've been mulling over in my mind for a long time at Mostafa was here asks. Is it gay to fap with friends? Yes

2123
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,120
I'm not prepared to condemn it to gay. All right quick get out of here. You fucking there are situations

2124
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,120
How do you mean there are situations?

2125
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,120
If you're back-to-back if you're back-to-back

2126
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,120
If you're back-to-back, it's not gay, dude

2127
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,120
No, they're not gay

2128
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,120
But why?

2129
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,120
If you're not gay, you're still a fag

2130
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,120
Just go to the fucking next door

2131
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,120
Well, just go home

2132
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:57,480
Would you be like would you be like like like two of you like backed into it like like back-to-back like fighting off waves of zombies like jizzing all over them

2133
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,520
Right

2134
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,120
That would yeah, that'd be okay. Look there was this this isn't this isn't actually like the full fap story

2135
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,120
But it's like when I was a little boy

2136
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,120
My friend showed me

2137
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:15,480
Some hardcore you're gay you guys you guys all know a heatherbrook right though the famous deep-throat artist

2138
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,720
She's a goddess

2139
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:22,080
And and she was my friends showed me that and I didn't jack off with them

2140
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,000
But I went to the next room and I jacked off and I just feel totally

2141
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,480
Vindicated for that that whole event and I don't feel there was a shred of gayness in the whole thing

2142
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,920
If anyone is gay, it's them for giving me a boner

2143
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,540
That's gay to bring up a porn when around your friends one time as a youth

2144
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,160
Me and a friend like like went to the bathroom

2145
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:49,080
And I like was peeing in the urinal and I finished and then for some reason I decided to like jerk off into the urinal

2146
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,280
Yeah, and like I was a little kid and like I don't know I like I thought it was cool

2147
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,740
I was like hey, hey, I'm jerking off. He's like are you jerking off? I was like, yeah, I am

2148
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,080
But you know what unlike Nate, I'm gonna get I was fucking gay and weird

2149
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,140
One time at summer camp a dude just pulled out his dick and showed it to me and said like dude, isn't this sick

2150
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,680
Is it I'm gonna be sick

2151
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,200
Are you a doctor by any chance

2152
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,360
We live in a mad world we live in a mad world a world of possibilities

2153
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,800
Personally, I don't think we're gay

2154
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:37,000
I don't think there's anything gay with a jerk in your dick while looking at a woman if your friends next to you fuck it

2155
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I got to agree on that

2156
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,520
Jerking off to a woman is gay then you need to be a value in your own sexuality

2157
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,520
Why do you got to do it with your buddy?

2158
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,840
Watching the same porno dude. That's weird, too

2159
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,720
The thing about is that the the the proximity of the dicks and the the awareness of both of you that there's some

2160
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,840
There's a there's a live dick somewhere right next to you

2161
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,640
What if we're both on our blind side it if you glance at it if you think about it then you're gay

2162
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,600
No, what if I don't examine well if you're at a separate like it's I mean we're the same blanket

2163
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,600
That's kind of just being gay with each other

2164
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,640
I mean

2165
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,400
What is wrong with all of you think about the historical context Tom come on like

2166
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:26,840
If you're double-teaming a girl that's basically like masturbating only using a girl as a masturbation to tool

2167
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,440
Right there

2168
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:50,040
That's funny term, okay, but but also consider even more apropos is the old like nudie picture

2169
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,640
Cinemas they used to have where everyone would go in and and fucking pee-wee Herman went and jerked off

2170
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,760
That's a bunch of strangers, and I assume they're not like next to each other

2171
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:06,360
I assume they're all like seated in they have a little cubicle like like that the people at the top jizz on the people on the lowest

2172
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:11,560
That's called that's called trickle down economics

2173
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:18,680
What if there's somebody at home who lives in a poor family, and they have to share a bedroom with like their brother

2174
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:24,720
Are they allowed to jerk off are their brothers in the room? You know yes desperate times call for stealth situations

2175
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,720
Yeah

2176
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,280
Stealth jerking off is different

2177
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,840
Totally different we've all

2178
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:44,360
Okay, okay, yeah stealth I mean I mean I'm I'm imagining like you both got your dicks out like right conscious, and you're both like yeah

2179
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,080
We're jack you're the gay one if your mind went straight to that

2180
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:57,440
That that's that's why I brought up like the whole like awareness thing like do they know that I'm doing it or

2181
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:01,680
Do I know that they're doing it if both of you know that the other is doing it, then it's pretty gay

2182
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,840
Disagree what I'm not looking at his dick. I'm looking at the tits on the TV. Okay, you know what?

2183
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:17,780
But it's stupid I wouldn't do it. I would feel let me ask you this is it gay to sword fight with your dicks is that no no

2184
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,480
I think it depends on how you do it

2185
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,840
It's only gay if your intention is to come from it. Yeah, I sort of agree. I sort of agree

2186
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,480
Yeah, I guess

2187
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,200
It's okay

2188
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:39,240
Just like cuz if a guy grabs your junk it just starts groping you like you may in fact get a boner despite being totally

2189
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,560
Heterosexual just from the physical stimulation to the same in the same way

2190
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,360
Getting a boner in order to sword fight with a dude is totally not necessarily gay

2191
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:53,840
But if the act excites you and the rubbing of the dicks against each other if that excites you that's gay

2192
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,560
And just why touching it has to be

2193
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:06,460
Maybe it maybe I said it right Ben I got a question for you physical stimulation is is is not gay then

2194
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,760
Then physical stimulation of two dicks

2195
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,560
Is

2196
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,920
It's not gay if it feels good guys

2197
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,080
Then I've got a test for you. Let's say your girlfriend wants to surprise you she says here Ben

2198
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:25,640
I'm gonna blindfold you give you a blow job. Yeah, she does. Oh, it wasn't her

2199
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,640
She had her brother do it

2200
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,520
And you think it was a chick are you now gay? Well, yes for sure

2201
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:42,480
Although I am although I am single now because my girlfriend is the intention is dead now

2202
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:51,520
The whole thing about about sexual orientation is that it's a preference if it's if you don't know that it's a guy

2203
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,520
Then it's fine. Yeah, so you just wear a blindfold all the time. You know as much and then sword fight all you want

2204
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,920
Okay, we we plumbed the depth. I feel like we've learned a lot today

2205
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:09,840
You guys are one piece experts has Luffy ever stretched out his dick like a sword and sword fight it

2206
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:16,800
It has well he hasn't done that. Yes. Well. Yeah, but there's that one though. There was that one chapter where there's those

2207
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,160
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, get get ready for this. What happened was stretched it. Yeah, I think they start the scene

2208
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,600
All right now listen to this listen

2209
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,720
So so Luffy once crash landed on an island of only women

2210
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:32,040
He was found you know, he was hurt really bad a bunch of women found him unconscious

2211
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,000
They brought him to a bath and they started bathing and they took off all his clothes and they were like oh my god

2212
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,720
He's he's got like a mushroom attached to we got to pull this off

2213
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:45,080
There was literally chapters of this girl. I forget her name Marianne or something stretch trying stretching his dick

2214
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,920
Oh, it's so stretchy. Why wouldn't it come off trying to separate his dick from his body?

2215
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,400
He's getting jacked off in canon one piece

2216
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,720
And they do it because they don't know what a man is yeah, I don't know

2217
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:06,480
Okay, it's pretty hot though. Nonetheless. It's pretty great. Now if it was a bunch of Amazon men would Luffy be gay. Yes

2218
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:14,040
Not from that but because he was unconscious, but then when he woke up he would become gay immediately

2219
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:21,040
Aware what awareness of sexual acts with men is what makes you guys. This is way more fun than animal rights

2220
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,840
We should do a whole episode. What is gay? This is way more fun. Oh my god. What is gay is a great

2221
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,520
Let's come back. Did you already did that on our social media podcast you faggot?

2222
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,880
It was already decided that it's only gay if the balls touch that that's a pretty good rule one theory

2223
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,080
We got alternative theories

2224
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,800
What about what about if one of your balls touches your other ball is that gay? That's definitely

2225
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,720
Yeah, gay gay. I'm gay right now

2226
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,880
There's not a man alive who's not gay is

2227
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,560
Nobody's gay. Oh

2228
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,640
Here's our last question

2229
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,800
At at pancake monster asks or at pancake monstay because I guess they couldn't fit the R

2230
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:18,080
What PCP member would be the easiest to kidnap? I'm gonna say Ben St. I will email his address to you

2231
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:29,000
I mean Ben St. Is just like ET only instead of Reese's pieces just take garbage and he'll follow and need it

2232
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:41,160
Ben will that's true. Ben is Ben is very predictable. He's very weak-minded. He is very susceptible to suggestion and trickery

2233
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,920
I don't think you'll have this trouble

2234
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,600
I'm just like a deer in the headlights all the time

2235
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:56,080
