1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello, hello, hello America. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast again. It's Sunday.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When we record this, we record this on Sunday.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, everybody. It's the show. We're both dead, it sounds like.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, I just stayed up all night last night and then I got like two hours of sleep.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not for any reason. I just didn't want to go to bed.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You like you do sometimes. So now I feel like shit for no gain, but that's okay.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's okay. It's good actually.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, it's not okay. I feel bad. I feel icky and sicky and sad.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Are you COVID free though?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I think so. Yeah, I don't see any reason to think I wouldn't be COVID free at the moment.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you COVID?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, completely avoided COVID.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So that's nice, although it does mean that yesterday, last week, yesterday, last episode, yesterday episode,

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
where I said, oh, I would be in the air. I could have flown. I just didn't know that I didn't already have it.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I could have had fun in America with friends and instead I was depressed crying all the time on the floor.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I played Jack 2 on my PS4 and that was alright.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Jack 2 though. It's a great fun little game until you get to like one of five missions of the worst thing ever made.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I got to one and then I rage quit. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't stand it.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was so tired of seething in real life. I didn't need to see that a video game as well.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I love Jack 2, although it's been a long, long time since I played it. I played the whole. I love the whole Jack series.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What a bizarre series. What a bizarre progression of games.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When I was young, it felt normal because I hadn't grown up with like, oh, the normal thing to do is to make Mario 64 and then Mario Sunshine.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When you're a kid, they can convince you anything's normal. Any fucked up shit. They want a big hand off to you.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So like going from a Banjo-Kazooie style collect-a-thon in different worlds to a GTA, Tony Hawk, free roaming city, murdering civilians and being like,

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog now. Bit weird. But it works.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It really does. I mean, it's got the same basic mechanics, right? It feels kind of the same to just run and jump around.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Kind of the same.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Spin dash and whatever.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think the platforming doesn't have much of a role to play, obviously.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think the hardest platforming comes in like, bits that you have to do with the jet board.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, the jet board. You have to fucking grind. You have to fucking grind every shit.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can grind on railings. It's Tony Hawk GTA Banjo-Kazooie.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And then Jack-3 is just like that again, but bigger.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah. I can't remember.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In Jack-3, they gave the big like dune buggy like vehicle. The huge driving areas, yeah.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Which was probably my favorite part of that game. They had the whole light eco as well, which you could fly and there was time stuff.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They had all these gimmicks built on the first game and the second game.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And they're like, okay, well, to make a third game, we have to build more gimmicks.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I think it sort of got to a point where there's too many, too many different things.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think they just needed to have the cars, the dune buggy stuff. But I don't know, whatever.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's what you do when you're making a video game and you don't know what to put it.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You just put in big, big cars. That's what they did with Banjo-Kazooie.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Not some bolts, right?

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh my God. They did.

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's the oldest trick in the book.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then the Crash Team Racing. The dad with Crash Banjo-Kazooie as well.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sure. Diddy Kong Racing?

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Everybody goes in a car at some point. Even Mario. Mario got a car.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He did. Good for him. Good for him.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The mission I was playing, it might not be that hard for some people.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But it was like, you're in the drill platform, which is like a giant drill,

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
drilling around in the ground. And you can look down and it's down there.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And you're on a platform high above spinning around because the drill is spinning,

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
which is kind of fun as a cool level.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But this mission is you get into a little turret thing on a rail

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and then you have to shoot these Crimson Guards jet pack guys.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And there's like a wave of 40 of them and they come from all around you.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And using the analog stick, it just sucks.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I looked it up. It's like, how do I do this?

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it was like many forum posts of like, this is the hardest mission in the entire game.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, I don't want to spend like three hours on this.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm going to go do nothing instead.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Man, I did.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then there was a one after that, which...

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That'll show those developers.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Fuck them.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not going to get their fucking trophies.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm playing on the PS4.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not going to 100% your shitty game suckers.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
On the PS4 port of Jak 2, it's kind of terrible.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Not like the games fine, but it's just sort of like buggy and extremely laggy.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Like way laggier than the PS2 would be, which is sad.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because eventually the PS2 will stop working.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
True.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the PS4 is relatively okay.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess I can emulate it. I think PS2 emulation is decent now.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Used to be like really...

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Probably.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Really shaky.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But now it should be fine.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Whatever. Who cares about Jak 2? Me. That's who.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right. That's correct.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to complain about the weather.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's so fucking cold.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's been so fucking cold here all week.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's so cold that the cold is like seeping through my windows.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And my radiator and my space heater aren't even enough.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That sounds dreadful.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It is a little dreadful. It's down to like almost zero degrees.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And my...

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just build a fire, get some lugs, get some cold, build a fire on the floor.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My window's too big. I just want it to stop.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Just like stop. Just stop having the properties of glass you fuck.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are they like shitty windows? They're like a single...

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, they're not great. I don't know. Probably.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, they probably are shitty windows. I don't know.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everything in my apartment is shitty.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But yeah, they're letting the cold in real good.

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then my radiator...

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And then my fucking radiator.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sometimes it gets so excited that it just starts clanging like really loud.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like it sounds like it's exploding.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Like a loud clang noise.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like a few feet away from my bed, so I'm just like...

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wakes me up at night.

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think I've complained about this before.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I probably will for the foreseeable future.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is that for that be like water hammer?

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Water hammer?

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Where like a bubble of air is in the pipes.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And something or other causes like the water to slush around.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And like that movement.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The water goes really fast and then smashes into the end of the pipe.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't really know what I'm talking about.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I'm...

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Water hammer.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because it's the sort of thing that would make a loud clang.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's not as loud as it gets.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But you can't hear it?

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, well it's going.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not as loud as it gets.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well okay, there is...

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Water hammer is a phenomenon that occur in any piping system where valves are used to control the flow of the steam.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The result of a pressure surge.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, it even sounds like it.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's interesting that there's a word for it.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hydraulic shock colloquial water hammer is a pressure surger wave.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So like if...

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think there was a time where there was something like that in the plumbing in our house.

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So I had to like...

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The plumber had to come and let air out to the top.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He had to go to the top of the house and let air out.

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So that there wouldn't be so much slushing around.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know how that fixes it, but...

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I guess if there's water everywhere, then water can't like accelerate and then stop suddenly.

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, you fill in the air bubbles.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, I think so.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Did I mention that like a few weeks ago, or maybe like a month or two ago,

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I had water leaking out of my fucking apartment ceiling?

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You did, yeah.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I guess that wasn't really a saga because it surprisingly did get resolved fairly quickly.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's the kind of thing that I can't like...

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's the kind of thing that you can't ignore.

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That turned out to be...

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean, you know, you see that and you're afraid that like a pipe has burst

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and like some fucking sewage is leaking somewhere.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No, it was like condensation from like one of the radiator pipes.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It wasn't like too too gross or anything.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just a bit.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I haven't had that happen anymore though.

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't condensate.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The radiator does work.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's just loud as fuck.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's annoying.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You know, speaking of cold,

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've been watching Game of Thrones like I said last week.

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've been watching it.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm on season six now.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's so many scenes that are like...

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They're like north of the wall.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They're in the snow.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They're like white walkers in the wildlings and all that.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And they don't have...

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They just have their coats and they're just walking and then they go to sleep

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and there's no fire.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They would die.

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They would just die if they didn't build a fire.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How do they even do anything?

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It doesn't make sense.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It feels like a little stupid, a little silly.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you think that they shot it in like...

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It wasn't as cold as it seemed?

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like they made the shot seem colder somehow?

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sure they were in cold locations.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But like, you know, the actors, they act and then they go to a warm like tent or trailer or whatever.

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And they warm up after their shoot.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But like, in the story, like characters will just be like,

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
oh, there's no time to build a fire.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We just have to huddle for warmth.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
In like the super cold, the winter, the definitely icy...

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like how the fuck?

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Can that even be done?

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I thought you would definitely die of hypothermia.

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think so.

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, I think so.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know, I didn't see any later seasons.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Maybe they wouldn't surprise me too much if they get sloppy about that kind of thing.

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That seems like the kind of thing that Preston Jacobs would lampoon in a review.

195
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Maybe if it's like possible.

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I mean, I can buy, like if a character is supposed to be like super hard and they can take any amount of weather, it doesn't matter.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They're just a social badass, they can just do that.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Like a wildling leader, I can buy that.

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But like Samuel Tarly, chubby boy, very unprepared for the world.

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Fat little baby needs his fire not to die in the cold.

201
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Little soft bitch.

202
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He doesn't know how to build a fire, so he can't and he doesn't.

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And he's not like shivering the next morning, he's fine.

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He's talking like he's not going to die.

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, he's talking like he's not going to die, but he's totally going to die.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, it's just sort of like when I feel cold, such as in winter, in real life, I'm like, dang, I can't stand this.

207
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I feel like if you know to go outside when it's cold, it's probably just that they fucked it up and didn't think about it.

208
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Your instinct is probably correct.

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I feel like they would need a fire in this situation.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't know.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well, they would be at least like the cheeks would be redder, the nose would be like icicles hanging off it or something.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think I, what did I watch?

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I think I stopped watching it at some point and I got all my, I got all my Game of Thrones from Preston Jacobs reviewing the new episodes.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

217
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Is that the one I'm thinking of, the person who does like the books with the full size of the video and then it becomes one third size of the video and then other things.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And then it ends up with a large map of words and pictures relating to the topic he's talking about.

219
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's, I'm not sure if it's that exactly.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's like, oh, what the hell is up with Varys and he goes into like.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You might be thinking of Alt Shift X.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh yeah, yeah, I recognize that name.

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, Alt Shift X is the, Alt Shift X is the mainstream sell out Preston Jacobs.

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm proud of knowing that person.

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Norminess is next to godliness.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's true.

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Preston Jacobs, I guess he wrote a novel.

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's like a pseudo historical novel.

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think it's called like, I think it's called like of wolves and Indians or something like that.

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's really, it's fun.

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's funny because like all of his video, it sounds like a title that he would give like one of his like series explaining something about Game of Thrones, but it's just the title of his book.

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's, it's, I'm not interested in reading it.

235
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's, it's funny.

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's funny to me when a YouTuber is like, I did something other than YouTube and I'm like, shut up.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Get back to the, get back to doing the thing that I came for.

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Get back to the, the click minds.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Get, get back to the, you get back to the video factory.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You sap, you slob.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's why I had to, that's why I stopped doing videos so that people wouldn't, wouldn't yell at me when I did things other than make videos, like make a video game for instance.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Very good.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Very classic.

245
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It was all, all calculated.

246
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I didn't want to get typecast.

248
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I didn't want to be too successful.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
As the, as the sonichu Winnie the Pooh poker streamer, put a Nuzlocke guy.

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You can't really have like a single thing going on with your channel.

251
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can't pin me down.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, that's, yeah, it's true.

253
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I mean, I guess the, like the sonichu lectures are what most people know me for because they're like the biggest things.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But you know, like I only did two of those.

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So, yeah.

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Everything, and everything else got modest views.

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Then the Nuzlocke's and the Winnie the Pooh stuff, they're all pretty, pretty modestly viewed.

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
None of that was a huge runaway success or anything.

260
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Sad, but true.

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh well.

262
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's funny that, like, I really remember the Nuzlocke's, but I think the, the main thing I remember from them is just, you're playing the video game.

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then when you get a new Pokemon, you draw them.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And when they evolve, you draw them and it's like the little picture changes.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I was like, oh, I love that.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I like the little picture changing.

267
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I sure would like to see a little picture change again.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh no, they died.

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The little pictures changed though.

270
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I mean, I'm entertained by this.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I like doing that.

273
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I am sort of mentally preparing for another Nuzlocke at some point.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I kind of want to do another Nuzlocke.

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I have some ideas for gimmicks for it that I will, I will, I think I have to do it at some point.

276
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't, I'm not, I'm not ready to do that like right away, but it's definitely a thing that I, certainly a thing I want to do.

277
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Although, like, I don't know.

279
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want to do it and I guess that, that means I will do it.

280
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But also like, you know, I say that knowing that like, I guess my old Nuzlocke's got some views.

281
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They got some viewership.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Maybe they got, I think the biggest ones might have like 30k views or something, which is not nothing.

283
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Honestly, honestly, you know what?

284
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Now that I think about it, a Nuzlocke series would probably get viewed more than say the Poo videos did.

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

286
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is a genius move, actually.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's definitely what I should do.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I got a gimmick for you.

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

290
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Instead of a Nuzlocke, you do-

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How about a less nuke?

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, you do a lock nuts where all the Pokemon wear chested belts and you lock them and their nuts are locked and you lock nuts.

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And then what?

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And when they die, they can finally release.

296
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's an edge lock.

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's an edge lock.

298
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All of the, all the Pokemon are edging the whole time.

299
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then when you've knocked out and they finally come, they have to go.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They have to leave.

301
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They have to leave the show.

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

303
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I mean-

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, they're not dead.

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You banished them because they finished edging.

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

307
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And like, well, guess you-

308
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're no longer pure.

309
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Guess you should leave now.

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Goodbye.

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sure.

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Only virgins on this Pokemon team.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Only virgins.

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Only virgins.

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And if you lose your virginity, if you have an orgasm for any reason, under any circumstances.

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Super virgins.

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Super virgins.

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Just like, oh, like the super straight thing, but it's super virgins.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And it's like, not only have I never had sex, I've never even come.

320
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I've never even, I've never even felt anything.

321
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So based.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So chase.

323
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So based and chase, baby.

324
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah.

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
USA.

326
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
USA.

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Classic USA.

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sure.

329
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Classic USA moment.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm trying to think of the word.

331
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's like-

332
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm trying to think of the word.

333
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's like wordle.

334
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wasn't it, was it Isaac Newton who wore like a Chastity device so he wouldn't like jerk off when he was like sleeping?

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That doesn't, well, I don't know.

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Or was it like Kant or someone like that?

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Isaac Newton was a perma virgin.

338
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Funnily enough, you know.

339
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He stuck all those needles in the back of his eye to see colors and he didn't get any puss.

340
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No.

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What the fuck?

342
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, nobody fucked him.

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Nobody fucked him even though he literally invented the rainbow.

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He invented the prism.

345
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He made light from the sun.

346
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He invented light and the rainbow, giving him a monopoly on leprechaun's gold.

347
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Wait, if he invented the rainbow, maybe people thought he was gay and that's why.

348
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh my god, that's right.

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He was typecast.

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He invented the pride flag and everyone was like, oh, I see.

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, this isn't cool yet.

352
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We don't like this at the moment in society.

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not so cool with what I'm seeing here.

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And he was like, no, no, it's like science.

355
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No, look, look at this.

356
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You can make telescopes and stuff.

357
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Microscopes even.

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Look what happens if I shoot it through a clear rock and everyone was like, shut up.

359
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Gay.

360
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

361
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Not away with you.

362
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Away at devil worship.

363
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah.

364
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Something, something game of thrones.

365
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Something, something.

366
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Renly's rainbow guard.

367
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Ha, ha.

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Faith of the Seven.

369
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Rainbows.

370
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Lamal.

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Ha, ha.

372
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Duh.

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What part of the show did you stop watching?

374
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do you remember?

375
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What part did I stop watching?

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think it was maybe right after Euron shows up.

377
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, so that's the beginning of season six.

378
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's where I am.

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Did I watch, did I watch all the way to season six?

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Maybe I did.

381
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

382
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Spoilers ahead, but I'm going to say the big thing.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Uh-huh, sure.

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The end of season five is where Jon Snow dies.

385
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, yes.

386
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes, I saw that.

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I did see up to the, I actually know that was where I stopped watching.

388
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That was the last one that I saw.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

390
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Euron appears in like episode one or two of season six.

391
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

392
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I was, I was basically right.

393
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

395
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That was, that's, that's the season where the, the books, there's no book stuff.

396
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

397
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The season five was like largely book and then it sort of stopped being the books near the

398
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
end of the season.

399
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's the end of the, the end of the, is it the, the end of the fifth book is just

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Jon dies, right?

401
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And same with like the end of the fifth season is Jon dies.

402
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And then it's like, well, now, now what?

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay.

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I, man, I don't, I don't like, I've said this before.

406
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't like watch enough shows.

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't read enough.

408
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't watch enough stuff.

409
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't consume, I don't consume enough media.

410
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Way too much of the stuff I like consume is like reviews and like critical stuff about

411
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
other things.

412
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Stuff I haven't even played.

413
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I've watched so much like Elder Scrolls criticism.

414
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I've never played an Elder Scrolls game.

415
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's sick.

416
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's, I'm sick in the head.

417
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm sick in the mind.

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I think it's, I think it's a sickness in society.

419
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Not me though.

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's society's fault.

421
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I guess so.

422
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's, I guess the reason review content is more approachable is because it's free and

423
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
it's right there and they explain everything completely so that you don't have to be wondering,

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
am I wasting my time playing this game?

425
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And then you watch review and they explain why this game is good and bad and you're like,

426
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
okay, well now I know.

427
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And so that, that inherently is more appealing to start with.

428
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But if you never go on to play or watch the thing, then you end up just seeing reviews

429
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
of stuff.

430
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I watched the new, do you know a channel, the channel called Bob Vids?

431
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Nope.

432
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's not a huge channel.

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's most known for, he did a bunch of videos about why CinemaSins is bad and he did a few

434
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
videos called Everything Wrong With, Everything Wrong With, in which he would do like dings

435
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
of CinemaSins.

436
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think I saw one of those somewhere.

437
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

438
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well he made a new video, like just like a few weeks ago, I think, where he sort of

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
does like, okay, it's been four years.

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Has CinemaSins improved on anything?

441
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And the answer is no.

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, why would he?

443
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah.

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Well he, yeah.

445
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I mean he said, he said they won't change and then he was like, well did they?

446
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I was right.

447
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
He was talking about their review of the newer Suicide Squad, the one with the giant starfish.

448
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And he shows like, he shows like the climax of it.

449
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He shows like the final moment.

450
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I haven't seen the movie, but it's the bit where like, there's like a flashback of like

451
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that girl talking to her dad about like, why rats are just like us.

452
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And like, if rats can be useful, then so can we.

453
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Like they're the lowest creatures just like us, you know.

454
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And it's like a, it's like, and it's like a touching little moment.

455
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I was, and I was like, oh, wait a second, wait a second.

456
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That seems like kind of like a good, was that movie good?

457
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Are there good movies?

458
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Is that a good scene in a mainstream film?

459
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh, fuck.

460
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It just changed everything.

461
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm gonna have to go watch.

462
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I know the feeling of like, oh shit, I don't watch it.

463
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't consume enough media.

464
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What's wrong with me?

465
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I used to be all about consuming media.

466
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Now I don't.

467
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, like, I don't know.

468
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It shouldn't be a job.

469
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
No, it's just, it's not like, it's not like I feel like I don't do enough like for a job.

470
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think I feel like because I don't consume enough media, I think I don't have enough like things to like think about.

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think I don't like have enough like new stimuli that is like making me think about stuff and giving me like things to discuss with people.

472
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I mean, does that, does that void have to be filled with like media?

473
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Could you not fill it with a hobby instead?

474
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Like, oh, I'm gonna learn wood carving so I can carve a little wood thing.

475
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I guess, I guess you could.

476
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I guess you could, but like mainstream media is like a, is like a shared cultural thing.

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Whereas like wood carving is like an endeavor one generally embarks upon solidarily.

478
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No, there's probably wood carving reddits and communities.

479
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Well, yeah, sure.

480
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There would be for any craft.

481
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean, yeah, you're, you're right.

482
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Like you want to go to the water cooler and be like, oh, did you watch the latest Housewives in a pit episode?

483
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Housewives in a pit, the new.

484
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Housewives in a pit, they're going crazy.

485
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They're going crazy.

486
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They haven't given them any food.

487
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

488
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Margaret like, like Margaret like clawed her way pretty far up the side this time until,

489
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
until George, George yet, you know, she got her hands on the, on the shovel and like,

490
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and like knocked her down and like broker femur with like the blade of the edge of the spade.

491
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And then that put that put it into that.

492
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh yeah.

493
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Very exciting episode this week.

494
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

496
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So you go around like, you know, the cultural consciousness, you talk about the thing.

497
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

498
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You go to the water cooler and say, look what I made, look at this wood, like a wooden ring.

499
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's like a ring made of wood.

500
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And look at the carving on that.

501
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

502
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And they say, cool.

503
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Sure.

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

505
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I think, I think what annoys me a little bit is the insistence that you've got to be hooked

506
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
into whatever bullshit is being made.

507
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I don't like it most of the time, except when it's really, really good, like Game of Thrones

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
or Breaking Bad or something like an HBO drama is usually something fun to get into because

510
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
it's quality, as well as culturally significant.

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like, I don't even one slight tiny piece of a shit to go and watch anything on Netflix

512
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
ever, or like, or like a Disney plus, or any of these streaming things where it's like,

513
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it's not immediately available.

514
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Well, I don't care.

515
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah.

516
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Mandalorian, when you go away.

517
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

518
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I think I'm, I think I'm just, I think I'm just thinking about like, I think I'm just

519
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
thinking about like, how do, how do I, how do I, how do I make more like connections with

520
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
people?

521
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
How do I connect with people more in life?

522
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Is, is movies, is movies what I'm, what I'm missing?

523
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean, it's a, I mean, if you're not interested in them.

524
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah.

525
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I doubt that they would be like a springboard for like a super interesting relationship on

526
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
its own.

527
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Maybe it would like be an icebreaker.

528
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Like, have you seen that movie?

529
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah.

530
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I guess that, that's what it could be.

531
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't know.

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah.

533
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Shit.

534
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Hell, I don't know.

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Hell, I don't know.

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I just thought that rat, thought that rat scene was pretty good.

537
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Bob Vidd said that rat scene was pretty good.

538
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And then he showed it.

539
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I was like, Hey, yeah, it was pretty good actually.

540
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Good job.

541
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Good job.

542
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Suicide Squad.

543
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Did they say, I'm the Jane Rat that meets all the rules?

544
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, no, no, no, no.

545
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
They were just regular sized.

546
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Unfortunately.

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That was a good, Bob Vidd is good.

548
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He doesn't really make like content.

549
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I mean, his only like, I think his only like regular content was that everything wrong

550
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
with, everything wrong with, and he only did like six of them.

551
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And then I think he was kind of just like, Hey, I'm done.

552
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Fuck it.

553
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And now he occasionally puts out like a little like five minute shitpost or a little like

554
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
joke video or something.

555
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Now it's making everything strong with this wrestler.

556
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But he came, but he came back for one last, for one last, one last word about the, about

557
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Cinema Sins in 2022 when we needed it most, when we really needed to be told that Cinema

558
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Sins was bad in case any of us had missed the memo the first time.

559
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah.

560
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Geez.

561
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't have any shit.

562
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't have any notes.

563
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't have any notes for stuff to talk about this week.

564
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think I'm thinking about like, maybe I should watch more movies because this is another week

565
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
where I'm like, well, what do I, what do I talk about?

566
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What did, what did I do?

567
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What did I do this week?

568
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If I'd watched a movie, I could talk about like a cool movie I watched at least.

569
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

570
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The idiots that listen to this would surely love to hear my thoughts on God, I don't know,

571
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
whatever is out now.

572
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Smiling friends is out.

573
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I haven't seen that yet.

574
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, um, you know.

575
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That's the, the Zach Hadel and, uh, uh, Kusek, Michael Kusek collaborative show.

576
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah.

577
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Um, I was seeing that all over the place and I kind of meant to actually go check that

578
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
out, but I, I forgot.

579
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So I haven't seen it.

580
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I, I was on like adultswim.com and I said, um, you don't have the right IP address.

581
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Uh, maybe, maybe you should use today's sponsor, Nord VPN.

582
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You can get a million dollars for free.

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It would, it would take me like 20 minutes to circumvent that, but I just couldn't be

584
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
bothered.

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I will watch it though.

586
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Cause it, it, I've seen clips and those are funny.

587
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I've seen a few clips that seem pretty, pretty good that I heard people, you know, I didn't,

588
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I didn't see anybody like, I didn't see anybody saying like it sucked or it was overhyped

589
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
or it wasn't as good as everyone was saying.

590
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I only saw people being like, this part was really funny.

591
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I liked it.

592
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I was like, okay, cool.

593
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah.

594
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They got the, the sick animation guy that does a voice and maybe some animation as well.

595
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The sick animation.

596
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
No, I don't think so.

597
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Uh, yeah.

598
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Nate likes him.

599
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He's like a weird animation guy who's done some small things for adultswim before.

600
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
They mostly are on YouTube.

601
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Uh, how do I explain it?

602
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Sick animation.

603
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Like it is sick.

604
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
A lot of it is like grotesque, but not like in a, you know, I have no idea how to explain

605
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
the body of work of sick animation.

606
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I mean, I'm seeing some images here.

607
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't, I don't know.

608
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't recognize this at all.

609
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't think I've ever seen this before.

610
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
They're, they're funny.

611
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
They're like, uh, they're like alternative humor, cranked to absurd levels.

612
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Hmm.

613
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay.

614
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I think that their, their latest one, Michelangelo was about Michelangelo, the turtle, but it

615
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
was trans.

616
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And there was a, there was a, this was an altercation at work where somebody misgendered them.

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But like that's the plot of a lot of their animations.

618
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's just sort of like.

619
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Somebody's trans and then they fight about it.

620
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No, no, no, no.

621
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Not the trans part.

622
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,760
It's just sort of like, it's a relatively mundane situation with weird characters involved.

623
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,880
And then they do weird things and it ends abruptly.

624
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,240
It's hard to know like what the joke is other than it's absurd.

625
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
It's absurd and it's great.

626
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
And I like it.

627
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,000
There's a lot of ones I like.

628
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
There were, there were like so many, there were a lot of voices that I recognize.

629
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Like Mike Stoklasa was in the pilot.

630
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

631
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I remember that.

632
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That's funny.

633
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay.

634
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I, okay.

635
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,800
I heard different people saying that the, the angry video game nerd was in it, but like,

636
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,500
I saw a disagreement about like what he did.

637
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,880
I saw someone say that he voiced Satan and I saw another person saying, no, there was

638
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,600
just like a still image of his face in, in the episode somewhere, like he, what his voice

639
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
was not actually in it.

640
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

641
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,080
I mean, you could check that with the credits surely.

642
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,000
If James Rolfe was in there, you know, I saw the, I did see the credits and it did say

643
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
James Rolfe.

644
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I just, um,

645
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Under what?

646
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Like voice acting?

647
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.

648
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It was listed as a voice.

649
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay.

650
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,920
I think it, someone said it was Satan, but then somebody else said no.

651
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760
So I don't know.

652
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,200
I probably could just check it if I wanted to.

653
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,960
I think I was thinking, I would just watch the app.

654
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,160
I think I was thinking I would just watch the episode and listen for when I heard him,

655
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,400
but I haven't done that yet.

656
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
So whoops.

657
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:40,440
Yeah, it's, it's definitely the sort of thing cause Zach, like a new grounds guy is like,

658
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,640
has been for years, like in, with like internet culture, more so than industry stuff.

659
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,960
So there's a lot of like deliberate like, oh, let's get this person, let's get Mike

660
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Stoklasso.

661
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Let's get like this and that.

662
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Yeah.

663
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Get in our show.

664
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Cause they can.

665
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
That's great.

666
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
It's inspiring.

667
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,000
I think for a lot of people who like make things on the internet, like, oh, there's a show.

668
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They worked hard.

669
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,160
They made a show about it and they made all these stupid references that they had and

670
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,960
like their, their let's play.

671
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,200
And it's like, oh, you can, you can just be in a let's play and make stupid jokes and

672
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,240
then make a show eventually if you're good enough and put them in there.

673
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
And it's like,

674
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Can you though?

675
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,440
It's, it's, it's an unrealistic, like a goal cause that never happens, but it's nice to

676
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
see it.

677
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Yeah, sure.

678
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
It's fun.

679
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:39,640
Like, I guess, uh, I don't know, obviously, yeah, it's not an attainable goal for most

680
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,760
people, but like, I don't know, I guess it had to be someone.

681
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,600
Why not, why not these internet guys that, that show whatever seems like it came out

682
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
good.

683
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,240
It's all, it's all good.

684
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,520
Uh, I'll, I'll probably check it out.

685
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,840
I'll make a show.

686
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll make a show and it'll be better than this show.

687
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,320
I'll put it on all the television channels and the streaming services.

688
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
That's right.

689
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
That is what I'm going to do.

690
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Yeah, that is exactly, that is exactly correct.

691
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,920
It's going to be called Ben St.

692
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,040
Uh, it's going to be, it's going to have a logo that says Ben St.

693
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,920
Patreon.com slash.

694
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,560
Oh, you know, I was thinking.

695
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:28,360
Somebody, one or two people, I think, asked me, uh, if I was going to make Blu-rays of

696
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,000
the Nuzlocs, like the old ones.

697
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,440
I saw that comment.

698
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,520
And I, yeah, and I remember, like, I've said this before, years ago, I tried to do that.

699
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,600
I tried to make, like, DVD menus for, uh, uh, I think it was Genocide, the first one.

700
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,000
And I got fed up with the software and I was like, fuck it, this is stupid.

701
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,160
But now, you know, I got the Pleeve and the Wii Blu-rays, uh, buy the Pleeve and the Wii

702
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Blu-rays, DM me on Twitter, uh, send me money, send me $30 plus shipping to, uh, IASUcomic

703
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,080
at gmail.com, uh, please, uh, thanks.

704
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,720
Um, and, uh, oh, I said, I, I, I made a joke tweet that they were canceled and, like, tons

705
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,640
of people thought I was serious.

706
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,960
Like many multiple people, like, thought they were actually canceled, like I was actually

707
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,200
canceling the Blu-rays.

708
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,920
I saw people thinking, like, oh, he must have got a DMCA from Trixie or something.

709
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,280
Like no, I, I thought I was really clearly joking, but like, like half a dozen people

710
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,240
were like, oh, they're canceled.

711
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Why?

712
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Was there a DMCA?

713
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,560
I was like, no, no, I made a joke about making it into NFT, um, anyway.

714
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,000
It's too close to, to serious posts they've seen.

715
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I guess so.

716
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,960
The world is, is funny now.

717
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,280
There is no such thing as, as a joke.

718
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,760
It is just funny.

719
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
Yeah, sure.

720
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,400
Uh, but no, they're real.

721
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,000
In fact, I had, I had like a dozen more to burn yesterday.

722
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,680
I think I have like four more to burn today, uh, a few more.

723
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,400
Um, but anyway, yeah, I could, if I wanted, I could just get slobed on, on, on Fiverr.

724
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,560
To do, I would just have to get the files together and tell him like, yeah, make me another one.

725
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,560
And then I would just have, you know, I have some extra discs left over.

726
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:32,000
I could, if I wanted to, I could make, I could make Blu-rays of the, of the, of the, of the

727
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Nuzlocke.

728
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah.

729
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Nuzlocke, Genocide and Nuzlocke.

730
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,040
And I was thinking, you know, since I want to do another Nuzlocke, I think probably what

731
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,760
I'll do is when I do that, at the same time, I will like, I will make, I will just make

732
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,320
a blue, like one test Blu-ray of the old ones and be like, yeah, hey, you could fuck it.

733
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,440
You can buy Blu-ray DVD cases for all, all of them.

734
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I made them.

735
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Why not?

736
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,720
I got this, I got this fucking printer.

737
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,160
I got this fucking printer that prints on discs.

738
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Yeah.

739
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,400
I guess if you got all the equipment.

740
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Yeah.

741
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,560
I got all the equipment now, paid, paid for from the, from the profits of the Blu-ray,

742
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
of the, the Pleeve and the Wee Blu-ray.

743
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,360
So I have all this stuff now and why not continue to use them to produce stuff?

744
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Right?

745
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:31,280
I don't know if that many people would actually want the Blu-rays of that, but like maybe a

746
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
few would.

747
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,640
And like, I don't have to make a lot.

748
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
I could make like 10.

749
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,400
I used to make like 10 copies and sell them of 10 people on them.

750
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,160
Yeah, it's, I mean, it's, I feel like people would like it just for the, the, the novelty

751
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,720
of having a Nuzlocke from Ben St.

752
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Honestly.

753
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,440
On physical media.

754
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,800
I will probably do it just even, even if, even without, without any expectation of like

755
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,920
selling any at all or very many or anything.

756
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,240
I'll probably just do it just because it's, it would be funny.

757
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,120
It would just be funny to have done it and be like, yep, it's on a Blu-ray.

758
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,360
Everything's on a Blu-ray now in the, in the year where everything's becoming an NFT.

759
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,920
I am like a decade behind the curve.

760
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,280
I'm, I'm making the jump to Blu-ray, baby.

761
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Yeah.

762
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Yeah.

763
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
I don't know.

764
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
So that's.

765
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
No, it's cool.

766
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
I'm just thinking.

767
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
So that's the plan.

768
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I guess.

769
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
I don't know.

770
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,040
I'm thinking about like, I've got my, my Redman comics now.

771
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,520
I saw, I saw those.

772
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,200
I saw those on Twitter.

773
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
They look and feel great.

774
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,440
They're a nice little small book.

775
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,800
You can have it in your, in your purse.

776
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,120
How big, how big are they?

777
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,520
They're like two 10 by two 10 millimeters.

778
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Two 10 by two 10.

779
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,520
So like smaller than a mouse mat.

780
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,520
Hmm.

781
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Let me, let me, let me pull up iRuler.com.

782
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
iRuler.

783
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Uh, okay.

784
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
200.

785
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
It's just pictures of emperors.

786
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
Oh, okay.

787
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,520
It's kind of a, oh, it's bigger than I thought actually.

788
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Uh, yeah.

789
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Gotcha.

790
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
Gotcha.

791
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Okay.

792
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
So like.

793
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
I think, I think it's that big.

794
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Seven inches, eight inches.

795
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah.

796
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,520
Seven inches.

797
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,520
I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the iRuler and 20 millimeters is about eight inches.

798
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,520
Or sorry, 20 centimeters, a.k.a. 200 millimeters is about eight inches.

799
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I typed in two 10 by two 10 millimeters and I got lenses.

800
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
No.

801
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Oh.

802
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
No.

803
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
That's wrong.

804
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
No, thank you.

805
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Well, whatever.

806
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
I know what they are.

807
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
They're over there in the, in their box.

808
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
So I don't want to take them out.

809
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Yeah.

810
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
But yeah, I got those.

811
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I got the, the spine with the little red man on the side.

812
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,520
And that was, that was my favorite part.

813
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
It's in the tweet.

814
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,520
Let me, let me, let me go take a closer, let me go take a closer look at that.

815
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Uh, my, the pleb, pleb and wee blue rays have the night.

816
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,520
They have the funny little, funny little, uh, Digi and Jesse little, little guys on the,

817
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,520
on the, on the spine.

818
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Oh yeah.

819
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,520
That's actually kind of to the same.

820
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
That's where.

821
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Yeah.

822
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Digi bro is, is just sitting down at the bottom of the, of the blue ray spine.

823
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
There he is.

824
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,520
He's just hanging out.

825
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
That's great.

826
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
That's great.

827
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Yeah.

828
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,520
It's, it's cause it was like one red man comic per page.

829
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,520
Um, and I did like a hundred of them.

830
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
I didn't even realize that's how many I've made.

831
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Are you, are you wearing some kind of like fluffy pirate shirt?

832
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,520
No, I'm wearing like a hoodie with a zip.

833
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,520
Oh, okay.

834
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
It just happened to be outside.

835
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Yeah.

836
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,520
It's, it's cool.

837
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
The third picture here, it looks almost like you've got like, like a white cuff and then

838
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
like a big puffy, like puffy arm.

839
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Okay.

840
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
Just, just check in.

841
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,520
Uh, but yeah, those, uh, those are nice quality and I have those.

842
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,520
The Lord of Ghosts books are also printed and they will be with me tomorrow as we're

843
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
recording on Monday.

844
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Um, and then I'll have to buy a bunch of, uh, envelopes and boxes to size so that I could

845
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,520
fit both of the comics and the plush and whatever else in the pin.

846
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,520
And I can be like, okay, I needed this many envelopes at this size.

847
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Then I can start fucking sell it and mailing them out.

848
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
That's exciting.

849
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
It is.

850
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
I'm, I'm almost ready to start.

851
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,520
I have a big stack of about like 48 DVDs or blue, blue rays here and I'm, I just have

852
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,520
to make like the last few more and I have all the envelopes addressed.

853
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,520
I haven't put the, I haven't put the things in the, I have to put them in the envelopes

854
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,520
and then, then I can take them to the post office.

855
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I'm going to take them all in one go because I don't want to make multiple trips.

856
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,520
Frustratingly, there used to be, before I moved here, apparently there was a post office

857
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,520
like right next to my house, like like one street over.

858
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,520
I guess they closed it due to COVID or something.

859
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
So now I have to take like, it's like a half an hour bus ride.

860
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I mean, you know, and include wait times to take like a fucking like two buses to get

861
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
to a, a damn post office.

862
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
It was very inconvenient.

863
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,520
It sucks.

864
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,520
It does.

865
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
It's too bad.

866
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
It's just, just too damn bad.

867
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
But anyway.

868
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,520
Yeah.

869
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,520
Mail-in.

870
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,520
Mail-in.

871
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,520
I can't wait to, can't wait to get my, what did I, I got the Redman book.

872
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
I got the Lord of Ghost book.

873
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
I got the plush.

874
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Did I get it?

875
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Was there anything else?

876
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
You got the pin.

877
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Oh, the pin.

878
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Yes.

879
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,520
The pin.

880
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Of course.

881
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Of course.

882
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Yes.

883
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,520
Very, very good.

884
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Very exciting.

885
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,520
There's still, there's still the matter of the, the ghost costume I have to make.

886
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Oh yeah.

887
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,520
And, and oh, and, and the doodle inside the book.

888
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,520
I think you had, you had like the maximum tier size.

889
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Yeah.

890
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
So you have everything.

891
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,520
So you get a doodle.

892
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
I will doodle something in the book for you.

893
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,520
Please.

894
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Sign it.

895
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,520
Please.

896
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,520
And thank you.

897
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Oh yeah.

898
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,520
So, so if, if the, the Lord of Ghost books are with me, I will have already sent out like

899
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,520
a questionnaire for people to send their addresses and what they want doodled if they were on

900
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
that tier.

901
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,520
So I guess if anybody who is listening to this had backed the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter,

902
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,520
who had pledged enough money, remember to tell me, because if I don't know what you want

903
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,520
me to draw, it'll just take a while for me to send it.

904
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
I'll, I'll leave them for last.

905
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,520
And then if you never respond, I'll just draw something and then send it.

906
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Can I tell you right now what I want you to doodle in mind?

907
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
Yes.

908
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Draw me, draw me, just draw me a picture of Phantom Horn as he appears in Phantom's

909
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,520
Revenge.

910
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,520
Phantom Horn.

911
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,520
Phantom Horn.

912
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,520
That version.

913
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,520
That version of Phantom Horn.

914
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,520
Yeah.

915
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,520
With the sword and the, and the raincoat and, and all that.

916
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
All right.

917
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,520
Did you, did you see my, my, my promo image, my Phantom's Revenge?

918
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
I did.

919
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,520
That was very cool looking.

920
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,520
I was so, I thought that came out so good.

921
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I was enamored of it.

922
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,520
You ever, you ever draw something and you just really love it and you just stare at it for

923
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
like a really long time?

924
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Uh, there have been moments.

925
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Yes.

926
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
I had, I had a moment like that with that.

927
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,520
I was just like, ah, I was, I was in awe of what I have created.

928
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,520
The, you know, sometimes, you know, the muse just works through me.

929
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
You know, I'm not responsible for works of genius like that.

930
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
They simply happen through me.

931
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,520
Yeah.

932
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,520
That's true of everything I do, actually.

933
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
Anyway.

934
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
Loved it.

935
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,520
Yeah.

936
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,520
I was glad, glad you caught that.

937
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Somebody, somebody was asking, somebody was asking me if I would make a plush Uwupati

938
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,520
for, for the, for the eventual Kickstarter for that.

939
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Uwupati.

940
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
I guess I could.

941
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,520
And I'm, and I'm used like, what if, what if I made a gummy, a little gummy Uwupati?

942
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Oh my God.

943
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
Cause, cause like it's got, um.

944
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
It's, that's a perfect gummy thing to make.

945
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,520
Yeah.

946
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,520
Cause he's a slime boy.

947
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
It's made of goo.

948
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
It's made of goo.

949
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:49,520
And it's got, cause you know, his, um, his, his, uh, most distinguished, I mean, he's got

950
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,520
the, the, the shape, the general shape and the cute eyes, but then like the brain, like

951
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,520
the visible brain, like floating in his little like membrane bubble.

952
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,520
And I was like, what if I made like a, like a carrot, like a caramel brain or something,

953
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,520
like a chocolate brain and I like encased it in like a, in like a sour green apple,

954
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
a, a gummy or something.

955
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,520
I don't know.

956
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,520
That would be unbelievable.

957
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,520
It would be unbelievably delicious.

958
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,520
You mean.

959
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
No.

960
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Yes.

961
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
It would be.

962
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Well, I feel like a chocolate thing inside of a slime goo would be a bit weird, but.

963
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
Yeah.

964
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
That's, that's a striking image.

965
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
Right.

966
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Right.

967
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,520
That would be like a, like a, what do you call it?

968
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,520
Like a, not gourmet, but like a, a candy thing that took a lot of work to make.

969
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Oh, like a, um, what's the, what is the word?

970
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Um, like hand handmade?

971
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,520
Is that the word?

972
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Like a hand crafted, like a, like a patissier?

973
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,520
No.

974
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,520
There's a word to describe like the, the fine artistry that goes into a single chocolate

975
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
treat, a confectionery thing.

976
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah, there is.

977
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Hmm.

978
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
Oh, I'm drawing.

979
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
I'm drawing a blank.

980
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Bass is the word.

981
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
Uh.

982
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Uh.

983
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Dude, bass is five letters.

984
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
That could be a word.

985
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
Oh.

986
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Oh, I got it.

987
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
I have, I was spoiled on yesterday's word.

988
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
I have not been spoiled on today's word.

989
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,520
So have you, have you done it yet?

990
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
No.

991
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
Should I do it right now?

992
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Do it right now.

993
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
All right.

994
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Have you, have you done today's?

995
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,520
I have.

996
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
Yes.

997
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,520
All right.

998
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
I'm going to start.

999
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
All right.

1000
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
We're going to walk through it.

1001
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,520
I'm going to start with my, my typical starting guess, which is a aches.

1002
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
I like, I like that one.

1003
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Oh, okay.

1005
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
We got the A and the S.

1006
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Um.

1007
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,520
All right.

1008
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:50,520
So I want to do, I want to guess a word that has an A and an S in the middle.

1009
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,520
So what about?

1010
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Hmm.

1011
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Uh.

1012
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,520
What about like rat?

1013
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
Rass.

1014
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,520
Raisin?

1015
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
No.

1016
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
Uh.

1017
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,520
Rass, raspy.

1018
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I got the R.

1019
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Hmm.

1020
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Nothing in.

1021
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,520
No greens.

1022
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
Okay.

1023
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,520
So an A.

1024
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,520
An A, there's an A in, in column three and four or three or four.

1025
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
There's an S in column.

1026
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,520
Well, one, one, two, or.

1027
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Oh no.

1028
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,520
No.

1029
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Uh.

1030
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Hmm.

1031
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,520
Hmm.

1032
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Hmm.

1033
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Okay.

1034
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,520
Can't give anything away.

1035
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
I can't say anything, but it is very quiet.

1036
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,520
Yes.

1037
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Uh.

1038
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
Oh dear.

1039
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,520
I didn't realize this might.

1040
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,520
This might require like extent, some somewhat extended periods of silent

1041
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,520
contemplation.

1042
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Um.

1043
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
Uh.

1044
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
What?

1045
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,520
Okay.

1046
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,520
Okay.

1047
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
I'll just, what if I did?

1048
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Because I want to try another one with the A and the S and the R.

1049
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,520
I just rearranged.

1050
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,520
So.

1051
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,520
How about.

1052
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,520
Hmm.

1053
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,520
How about.

1054
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,520
So.

1055
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,520
Uh.

1056
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,520
No, not sauce.

1057
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,520
That's not.

1058
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,520
That's not gonna work.

1059
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,520
Um.

1060
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
So.

1061
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Uh.

1062
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,520
No, not sauce.

1063
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,520
That's not.

1064
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
That's not gonna work.

1065
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,520
Um.

1066
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
So.

1067
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
So.

1068
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
So.

1069
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
So.

1070
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
So.

1071
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,520
So.

1072
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
So.

1073
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
So.

1074
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
So.

1075
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
So.

1076
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
So.

1077
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,520
So.

1078
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,520
So.

1079
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,520
So.

1080
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
So.

1081
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,520
So.

1082
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,520
So.

1083
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
So.

1084
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
So.

1085
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
So.

1086
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
So.

1087
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,520
Okay.

1088
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
What about, how about, um, slay?

1089
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,520
What's another?

1090
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
What's slay?

1091
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520
Sleigh Queen.

1092
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Sleigh Queen.

1093
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
I've already guessed, I've already guessed why.

1094
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,520
So that would be a way.

1095
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
How about slack?

1096
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,520
I already, I already guessed C. How about in slake?

1097
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,520
I already guessed E.

1098
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,520
Slah.

1099
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Slah.

1100
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,520
Slah.

1101
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Slah.

1102
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,520
Slah.

1103
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,520
Slah.

1104
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Slah.

1105
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Slah.

1106
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,520
Slah.

1107
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,520
Slah.

1108
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Slah.

1109
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Slah.

1110
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,520
Slah.

1111
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,020
Slam, because this is exactly what goes on in your head when you play.

1112
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,480
Oh, slit, slew, blit, blue, green.

1113
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,240
Yeah, trying to like, trying to like, force a word.

1114
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,600
Finetically figure it out, even though a lot of the times the word

1115
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,900
phonetically does not sound the way it's spelled.

1116
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,380
OK, you get fucked.

1117
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,780
What if it OK, what if I went with like slow?

1118
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,120
No, there's no there's no O.

1119
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,540
It's got to be an A and an E.

1120
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,540
I'm sure those are the only two vowels.

1121
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,180
Slaw, slaw wheel, Ryan.

1122
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:10,060
Slah, sledge, slah, slacko, S-L-A-K-O, slab, I'm just trying to find a combo

1123
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,520
that doesn't waste any letters.

1124
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,560
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, OK, OK, what about no salt would have an A

1125
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,120
in the same position as before?

1126
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,600
Damn it.

1127
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,280
OK, OK.

1128
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,800
Oh, wait, no, I've only found one.

1129
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,240
I've only found one vowel.

1130
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:38,440
So it could have like slow, sloy, no, slo-

1131
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,080
Eliezer, could you put a graphic of this on screen so people can look at something?

1132
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,800
So like the first word been guessed at the top.

1133
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, but what about like a loan?

1134
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,680
Well, that would have an S, loans would have another.

1135
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,400
What about, oh, what about no, loser, loser would would have the S in the same?

1136
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,320
Just don't want to waste any any information.

1137
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:24,000
Low, low, no, it would either be loafs or could do loafs.

1138
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,240
No, I know, like bread.

1139
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,840
No, it'd be a VES.

1140
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,640
I think I think loafs is a word.

1141
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,000
I think loafs is a valid is a valid word.

1142
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,760
I don't think so.

1143
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,200
But maybe maybe it's another Americanization.

1144
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,840
Those damn Yankees, they fucked me.

1145
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,880
Yeah, with them was it's favor favor, right?

1146
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,480
They have no honor with a U.

1147
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,600
It has a U in it.

1148
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,080
Honor, honor, honor, damn.

1149
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,280
How about Maros?

1150
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,840
Joy, no.

1151
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,200
America.

1152
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,720
How about Tart?

1153
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,000
No, I can't do Tart.

1154
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,240
I can't do Tarty because it's got I already guessed why in the last lot.

1155
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:23,080
Tart, tar, tariff, is there two F's in tariff?

1156
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,280
Yes, damn it.

1157
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,760
Well, there's two R's to I know.

1158
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,120
Yes, no, it's T-A-R-I-F-F, I think.

1159
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,520
How about OK, OK, I got it.

1160
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,960
How about Tal?

1161
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,120
How about how about Talon?

1162
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,160
Wait, no, there's no R and no S in that.

1163
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Fuck.

1164
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,760
Did you guess it already?

1165
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,040
No, I'm going to do it.

1166
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,440
OK, the L, the L is good.

1167
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,600
Wait, no, no, I repeated the A.

1168
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,000
I repeated the second slot.

1169
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,840
Hey, I'm so fucking stupid.

1170
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,680
Oh, whoopsie.

1171
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,880
I know I just realized this kind of annoying.

1172
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,440
What's this?

1173
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,840
Wordle has six letters.

1174
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,040
Yeah, some word.

1175
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,960
Someone got rid of this discord was like,

1176
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,560
why didn't they make the name five letters

1177
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,880
like like the whole game is about?

1178
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,320
All right, squirtle.

1179
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,320
OK, mo, mo, mollar, mollar.

1180
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,880
Oh, my this might be it, actually.

1181
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
No.

1182
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,680
OK, it's pretty good.

1183
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,280
Oh, it's solar.

1184
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,480
OK, got it.

1185
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,240
Got it.

1186
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,320
Got it. Got it in five, baby.

1187
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,800
I got mine. I could have got mine in three.

1188
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,160
Well, I'll I'll I'll run you.

1189
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,360
I have never gotten one in less than five.

1190
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,720
I have five in five and three in six.

1191
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,400
So I'm not that great at this, actually.

1192
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Not going to three.

1193
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,000
No, I got three in six.

1194
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,400
I got five in five and three.

1195
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,440
Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah.

1196
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,120
That's what I meant to say.

1197
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,800
The the trick is is like

1198
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,560
never guessing if you would repeat a letter.

1199
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,520
Yeah. Or if a word like.

1200
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,040
I don't know. Never never make a guess.

1201
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,360
I mean, well, I don't know.

1202
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,480
I guess I never make a wasted guess.

1203
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,320
Yeah, that's why, like.

1204
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,120
It was a waste.

1205
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,280
It was a waste to guess Talon because that I wanted I knew

1206
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,480
I wanted to have an A in a new spot to find where the A goes.

1207
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1208
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,720
There's there's definitely like a like a strategy to

1209
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,200
yeah, like getting each new each new guest to give you

1210
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,120
like the maximum amount of information it possibly can.

1211
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,000
So like ice, that's the strat to always win.

1212
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,240
But maybe not always to win in like few guesses.

1213
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,080
I don't know to win in a few guesses.

1214
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,520
I feel like you kind of got to like maybe maybe going with your gut.

1215
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,800
Maybe going with your gut will get you more like wins in three,

1216
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,960
but also like will risk you just like fucking up and failing.

1217
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:23,480
I I usually don't have why I say usually it's always I never have.

1218
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,240
A strategy for the first word, I just think of one.

1219
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,480
So I put in pride for this one.

1220
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,920
P R I E D like you pry it open.

1221
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,040
Oh, yeah, from that.

1222
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,080
And then I thought, OK, the R can't be in the second slot.

1223
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,360
I'll try the thing that begins with R and I put roast.

1224
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,040
And I gave me the O and the A and the S and the R all in different places.

1225
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,400
So from there, I struggled, but I've eventually figured out.

1226
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,960
Oh, so now I put it in, but is the wrong middle letter?

1227
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,200
If I if solar, if I had just thought a little harder,

1228
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,120
I would have realized with my guest molar that wait a second,

1229
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,160
I know there needs to be an S in the word.

1230
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,880
So, like, yeah, I could have just guessed solar right away

1231
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,320
if I thought about it.

1232
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,640
But I but I but I didn't oh, well.

1233
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,440
Oh, well, that was that was how much.

1234
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,960
How long did we just make the listener listen to me?

1235
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,240
Oh, well, we're at all.

1236
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,480
They love it. They love it.

1237
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,120
They're playing along with like a week old.

1238
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,520
They fucking better. Yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,280
There's got to be some app that lets you like play old wordles, right?

1240
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,120
There aren't, but there are

1241
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,760
like wordle adjacent games that are basically the same thing

1242
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,960
that just make random things you can play.

1243
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,040
Because what I want to do, yeah, is go back and play the other

1244
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,440
like 200 wordles that I missed.

1245
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,800
Like if I'm going to pay DLC, honestly.

1246
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,160
Yeah, they should just do that if they want to make a million dollars.

1247
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,120
But who wants to do that?

1248
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,640
I think the the thing with it.

1249
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,840
Is they don't want because, like, obviously,

1250
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,560
you can just look up the answer

1251
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,560
and they don't want people to have access, easy access to the answer.

1252
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,720
But like, but you can already have 24 hours.

1253
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,160
Yeah, like look up the answer.

1254
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,000
So it's like, I don't know why I disagree.

1255
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,840
I think it's annoying that that you can get your wordle

1256
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:42,360
like based on your time zone, like Europeans get it before I get it.

1257
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,640
I think that's dumb.

1258
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,680
I think they should just have one universal time when it turns over for everybody.

1259
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,080
It's stupid that like it's stupid.

1260
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,040
It's stupid that like some people have the new wordle

1261
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,560
and they can solve it and post their solution.

1262
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,480
Well, other people like have to wait.

1263
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,960
I just think that's like bad design because because wordle,

1264
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,600
like the whole point of wordle, like the puzzle is fine.

1265
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,880
But the point of wordle, the innovation of wordle,

1266
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:12,400
the things it makes successful is the virality of like the emoji

1267
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,880
sharing mechanism and the like the communal aspect of everyone's

1268
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,760
posting their results and comparing the results.

1269
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,840
So it just makes more sense to if it turns over at one time for everybody,

1270
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,120
then everybody can be there at the same time and be like,

1271
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,560
oh, new wordle just dropped. Let's all let's all do it.

1272
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,360
I kind of agree.

1273
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,760
But I feel like if it had that quality,

1274
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,880
some people in the world could do a wordle

1275
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,800
and then five minutes later do the next wordle

1276
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,400
while everybody else is asleep on the other side of the world.

1277
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,160
And then they'll wake up like it's exactly the same problem

1278
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,040
that you could see other people's things before you'd have a chance to do yours.

1279
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,560
Well, I mean, it's always it's always going to be a problem.

1280
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,040
No, it reduces the problem, though, because then ever everyone has it available.

1281
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,240
Everyone has the same window to be spoiled in.

1282
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,560
There's not like some people that are more spoilable than others.

1283
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,120
I don't find it. I mean, maybe I'm just I'm not really worried about the spoilers.

1284
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,600
I just it's not so much the spoiler thing.

1285
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,200
It's that like when if like like like other people in like, say,

1286
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
my discord server, they're doing the wordle.

1287
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,080
So like the Europeans are all like doing the wordle, comparing their guesses.

1288
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,600
And then the Americans just got to be like, all right, cool.

1289
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,080
Well, I'll let you know how it went for me seven hours from now.

1290
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,680
Slame, it's dumb. I like it.

1291
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess.

1292
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,720
The the the instant communication is not possible in time zone stuff.

1293
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,680
Yeah, I think I think I think it's I think it would be it's more.

1294
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,120
I don't think much would be lost

1295
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,040
if like the new wordle doesn't appear at midnight for everybody.

1296
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,320
I think it would be OK if for some people it appears at midnight

1297
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,320
and for some people it appears at 5 p.m. and so on and whatever.

1298
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,640
Because it's still because everyone still gets one every day.

1299
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,760
Yeah, that's not those are my those are my wordle thoughts.

1300
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,640
That's my criticism.

1301
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,400
That's my that's my advice for the wordlers.

1302
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,200
Get it get it together.

1303
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,040
Yeah, I mean, I've I find it to be quite fun,

1304
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,040
but it is mostly the communal aspect.

1305
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,160
I was playing on some of those other sites where you can just do randomly

1306
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,720
generated wordles words, but it's not wordle.

1307
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,880
It's just exactly the same thing on a different website and it there is no one per day.

1308
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,440
So you get a random seed, you got a word and you got to figure it out.

1309
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,080
And I'm like, OK, let's try this.

1310
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,640
And then I realized that once I finished it, I can't tell anyone about it.

1311
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,960
And right, I realized that the game itself is too luck based

1312
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,600
to be like a compelling strategy game.

1313
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
There's there's some strategy to it.

1314
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,240
There's some strategy.

1315
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,200
But it is a guessing game.

1316
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,560
That yeah, the first word you use

1317
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,600
is like it determines quite a lot.

1318
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,920
And yeah, and another thing is that you can use your information

1319
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,360
of past wordles to be like, OK, well, it's probably not going to be the same word

1320
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:29,720
as yesterday. So like, yeah, like if you remember a bunch of them,

1321
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,520
it's like, well, it's probably not any of those.

1322
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,120
But I mean, how much does that really narrow it down?

1323
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,280
There's still like 100,000 words that it could be true.

1324
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,600
But if you if you like guess and you get a bunch of yellow letters

1325
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,400
and you're like, OK, I could arrange them in this way.

1326
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,480
But that would give me a very similar word, a letter, a word from like two days ago.

1327
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,280
And I'm like, well, it's probably not going to be that one.

1328
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,320
So knowing that I could think what other word could it be?

1329
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,760
And it's like, I don't know.

1330
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,920
If there's more strategy with the the wordle game, if we assume

1331
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,680
that the list of wordle words is is not purely randomly seeded

1332
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,640
but is curated by someone, then I think it's probably true

1333
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,680
that you wouldn't expect to see like two very similar words back to back.

1334
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,160
Although you might. Sure, you might.

1335
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,600
I mean, how it's been to 111.

1336
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,560
How many five letter words even are there?

1337
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,920
I think I looked it up and there's like 168,000. That's OK.

1338
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,320
OK, we're all right.

1339
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,320
Yeah, we'll be OK. Yeah.

1340
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,560
We'll keep it going for a few years, I guess, few decades.

1341
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,600
Yeah, I mean, it's it's a good it's a good little puzzle,

1342
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,200
but the the share button and the emoji.

1343
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,960
That's yeah, that's where the real fun is.

1344
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,440
Yeah, because if I want like a real.

1345
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,440
Puzzle.

1346
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:59,080
I like having all the information and my disposal at my at my use.

1347
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,400
So like if I can have all the information and then it's like figure out

1348
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,280
the answer with all this information and like, oh, let's hmm, let's hmm.

1349
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,400
And it's like a puzzle. It's fun. It's it's brain tingly.

1350
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,560
It's engaging with wordle.

1351
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,280
You can just get fucked by having a bad guess on the first one.

1352
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,480
It gives you not enough information to get the word.

1353
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,640
I feel like there's probably I feel like there is probably some

1354
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,000
like optimal strategy that is pretty much that you'll never lose.

1355
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,080
Yeah, me either.

1356
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,440
It's it's like if I let oh, you say quidjibo.

1357
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:40,160
And that's like the word that the letters that are perfectly

1358
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,560
tailors to be like of all the five letter words.

1359
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,720
These are the ones that come up the most often.

1360
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,440
And there is for you should put them in there.

1361
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,440
So I don't I would rather not know what that is.

1362
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,320
Yeah.

1363
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,360
And even then it won't work every time.

1364
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,880
Yeah.

1365
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,240
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder if

1366
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,040
with an optimal strategy, you would be guaranteed to always win wordle.

1367
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,600
I I'm going to define when, you know, to always I feel like in six guesses.

1368
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,240
I feel like in six guesses, it's always possible.

1369
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,240
I think there's kind of enough to fail.

1370
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1371
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,440
I think most likely if you use like different letters on each word

1372
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:33,000
and each word is a real word, then I think six is enough every time.

1373
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,520
This would make a good I haven't done it in five yet, I don't think.

1374
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,240
You haven't done it in five.

1375
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,440
Oh, let me check my let me check my stats.

1376
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,960
Wait, you've you've done it in three, but not in five.

1377
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,000
Statistics. Oh, no, I have done it in five.

1378
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,000
I've done it once in five, three times with four and then twice with three.

1379
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,840
That's funny.

1380
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,440
I'm just too smart, you see.

1381
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:05,400
Too smart, too smart for too smart for five, but also too stupid for five.

1382
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,880
I just go above and below.

1383
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,440
I can't get that perfect sweet spot of smartness.

1384
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,840
Yeah, wordle, wordle, great, great stuff.

1385
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,520
Like every time I type it, I type wordly instead.

1386
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,680
No, worldy, worldy, worldy.

1387
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,480
Well, that well, that's over.

1388
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,400
What? I don't know.

1389
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,920
What else? What else is going on?

1390
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,200
Hang on, I got a P.

1391
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,320
I'll be back in a second.

1392
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,760
All right. A few moments later, a.

1393
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,640
Hello.

1394
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,120
And we're back and we're back.

1395
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,600
And we're back.

1396
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,200
Pleab in the wee blue rays, 30 fucking dollars.

1397
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,480
Patreon Venmo me at Ben St.

1398
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,000
Capital B, capital S.

1399
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,400
If you don't have PayPal, you could Venmo me if you want to.

1400
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,200
You could send it to my Bitcoin wallet.

1401
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,440
I got a Bitcoin wallet.

1402
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,400
I posted it on Twitter.

1403
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,480
Why would anyone send to a Bitcoin wallet?

1404
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,040
Surely their donation will disappear immediately.

1405
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,480
Um, this Bitcoin will change value.

1406
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,640
It would fluctuate.

1407
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,640
That's true.

1408
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,600
But if I if I withdrew at the same day,

1409
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,320
it would probably be more or less secure.

1410
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,440
I don't know if if all.

1411
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,280
Listen, if all you got is Bitcoin,

1412
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,560
I will accept Satoshi's in my Bitcoin wallet.

1413
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,480
If it would just be just, I mean, I think it would be pretty funny.

1414
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,920
I think it would be pretty funny to buy

1415
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,080
Pleab in the wee blue rays with a Bitcoin.

1416
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,560
Uh, right, right.

1417
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,480
Come on. Come on.

1418
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,600
It's just that's just funny.

1419
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,720
That's just that's just comedy.

1420
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,760
Posting posting my posting my Bitcoin wallet in the server.

1421
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,760
Right there.

1422
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,800
Oh, yeah, there it is.

1423
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,120
I'll send little little Bitcoin gremlins to come and steal it.

1424
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,120
You can you can now.

1425
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,720
No, digital like skirmishes digital like a rating party.

1426
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,320
You can share your wallet and it just means other people can put money in.

1427
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,920
They can't take money out.

1428
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,840
And by money, I mean cryptocurrency, which.

1429
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,400
I get, I guess it's money.

1430
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,240
I guess it's sort of money.

1431
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,480
I don't know.

1432
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:37,120
I guess the only other thing on my on my topic list is

1433
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,800
covid house since my dad had covid.

1434
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,440
And yeah, it was like, oh, probably like too risky to fly.

1435
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,440
Maybe it wasn't risky enough to fly.

1436
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,200
It wasn't risky enough.

1437
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

1438
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,120
But like, you know, whatever, staying in my room,

1439
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,240
staying away from dad.

1440
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,480
How is he doing?

1441
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,280
Is he is he sick?

1442
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,920
He was coughing and spluttering, but it appears to be all right.

1443
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,520
He had the double vax in the boost.

1444
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,080
So OK, too much damage going on.

1445
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,960
He seems fine.

1446
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,840
He's walking and talking and stuff.

1447
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,400
Yeah, we have to talk across the room.

1448
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,600
Sure, sure.

1449
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,800
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

1450
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,920
Sorry, you can continue.

1451
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,760
But I just I just remembered I got something.

1452
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,880
Let me show you what I just ordered on Amazon that just arrived at covid.

1453
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
That's fucking right.

1454
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,040
It's fucking covid, baby.

1455
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,600
No, it's some fuck.

1456
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,040
Well, yeah, and yeah, I was just going to say that.

1457
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,520
It's been.

1458
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,520
It's been like a little it's been fine.

1459
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,560
It's been fine.

1460
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:56,760
I thought it would be worse, but like nobody else in the house has got it yet.

1461
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,520
Even mom who's been spending time with them.

1462
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,280
She's been wearing a mask, but like they've been in the same room.

1463
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,720
I think it's just because like everyone has the vax.

1464
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,920
So like transmission is difficult for the virus.

1465
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,920
It's it's more difficult, more difficult.

1466
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,200
Yeah, it's yeah.

1467
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,600
So luckily, hopefully dad will test negative soon.

1468
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,840
It's been like eight days and he's been positive every day.

1469
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,200
Oh, how much is a how much is a test over there?

1470
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,320
Because they're like expensive.

1471
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,120
It's like it's like 15 bucks for a fucking test over here.

1472
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,200
It's annoying.

1473
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,400
We haven't been doing the tests every day.

1474
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,960
It was like on day six or seven, if you test negative twice in a row,

1475
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,600
you can stop isolating because it's thought to be gone.

1476
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,120
But if you don't test twice, two days in a row, then it's like you still have it.

1477
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,000
Yeah, if you don't test negative.

1478
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,080
So on the sixth day, my dad started taking them one per day.

1479
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,200
It was looking like it was going to be gone.

1480
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,280
But then on the eighth day, it was there again.

1481
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,440
So whatever.

1482
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,720
OK, I found this is not the exact model that I got.

1483
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,440
But actually, it's it's pretty close.

1484
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,560
Yeah, I ordered one of these and I got it now.

1485
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,200
It just arrived.

1486
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,320
And you know, is that like the the you like doing paint work?

1487
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,320
Yes, like sawdust.

1488
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,000
Yes, it is.

1489
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,040
Yeah, it's for like industrial applications.

1490
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,080
I wanted to buy one of these last year.

1491
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,120
Just because I think they look cool, but they do.

1492
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,680
I kind of meant I just kind of assumed they would be really expensive.

1493
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,640
They're not there.

1494
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,320
It was like it was like forty five bucks for like the mask and the cartridges,

1495
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,400
like the filter cartridges, because the pink things on the sides are replaceable.

1496
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,200
I can I just assumed it would be expensive and I didn't look into it.

1497
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,800
And I think I also was kind of like.

1498
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,440
If I get a mask like that, it's sort of like, I don't know, it feels kind of like

1499
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,760
I don't want to be that guy who's like super paranoid looking.

1500
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,640
Yeah, like I don't want people to think that I'm like some kind of like prepper freak,

1501
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,360
you know, I don't want people to think that I'm some sort of like

1502
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,760
anti social weirdo who is like going above and beyond like doing

1503
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,240
like taking unreasonable measures to isolate myself from society.

1504
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,720
Like, you know, a regular if a regular mask works,

1505
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,240
then why wear one of these unless you're a psycho?

1506
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,080
Right. So I talked myself out of it.

1507
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:33,200
And I think I think it was also kind of like it would be sort of giving in to panic

1508
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,200
to to to to to do to go this hard.

1509
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,320
But that was when I thought it was expensive.

1510
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,920
Turns out it's not so it's actually fine.

1511
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,720
But like I always I wanted one and I think I wanted to look like that.

1512
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,880
I want to look like Bane.

1513
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,480
I want to look like a monster.

1514
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,960
So I didn't do it.

1515
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,360
And then it was to my eternal shame.

1516
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,040
So I finally I finally pulled the plug.

1517
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,160
I'm not pulled the plug.

1518
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:01,640
I finally pulled the lever, hit the hit the switch,

1519
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,080
pulled the whatever I did it, and I think it literally like arrived

1520
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,600
in my house like today and is like sitting in a box upstairs in my foyer.

1521
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,840
Probably I haven't checked yet.

1522
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,480
Do you have one with green filters or do you have like rowdy pink?

1523
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,880
Tragically, they only come in pink.

1524
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,480
I wanted purple ones, but they don't know.

1525
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,640
Yeah, you would think if they make them in like that bright

1526
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,680
day glow color, like you would think maybe they have them in different colors.

1527
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,200
No, they just only come in pink for some reason.

1528
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,840
I don't know why, but a bit disappointing.

1529
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,440
I guess I could dye them or paint them or something.

1530
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,520
I don't know you spray them with paint and then plug them up.

1531
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll work.

1532
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,680
That'll work.

1533
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,120
Yeah, I can't actually breathe in it anymore, but it looks amazing.

1534
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,720
Looks incredible.

1535
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,760
You should you should wear like a like a big fireproof jumpsuit

1536
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,960
alongside that and a backpack with a flamethrower attached

1537
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,120
and hold a flamethrower and go around with a flamethrower.

1538
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,720
I should just I should just I should just have a bubble.

1539
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,360
I should just live in a bubble, live in a hamster wheel.

1540
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,960
You should have a 10 rewb to like bubble.

1541
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, those guys never get COVID.

1542
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,600
If I would, if I could.

1543
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,760
Yeah, so anyway, I'm pretty excited about that.

1544
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,240
Don't know when I'll have the chance to wear it in public.

1545
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,320
You know, I bought the gator.

1546
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:46,000
I bought the neck gator that had my face, but in like RFCK colors

1547
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,800
with like the bright green teeth.

1548
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,920
Yeah, did you wear that or were you chicken?

1549
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,440
I did. I did wear it a few times.

1550
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:59,240
The thing about that, though, is like this is this is not just all all

1551
01:19:59,240 --> 01:19:59,960
gators like that.

1552
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,800
Like I've seen gators that have like a face printed on them

1553
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,440
and they don't they don't actually look like a face when you wear them

1554
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,520
because like they're warped and stretched over a surface.

1555
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,320
Like it the illusion is not.

1556
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,560
It's not convincing.

1557
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,320
Like your brain does not see it and think, oh, it's a it's a guy

1558
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,200
with like a creepy smile.

1559
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,400
You think like, oh, it's a guy in a gator.

1560
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,920
Wait, what's that printed on the gator?

1561
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,040
Is that oh, it's supposed to be like a mouth.

1562
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,720
OK, whatever. Right.

1563
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:30,880
It's just it's unfortunately just not a very convincing visual effect.

1564
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,000
But I did wear it a few times.

1565
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,040
So this is my new that this is the new one.

1566
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,440
It's like, do I have the do I have the guts to just go out in public?

1567
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,320
Looking like a.

1568
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,160
Well, here's what will be I don't know.

1569
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,200
What do you think?

1570
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,640
Would people see this and be like, this guy's a freak?

1571
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,200
Or would people see this and this like, this guy is flattening the curve.

1572
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,640
We should all be more like this guy, this guy's a hero.

1573
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,360
I think I think they'd think both of those things at the same time.

1574
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,960
Hmm.

1575
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,840
And you know what?

1576
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,760
This this freaks flattening the curve.

1577
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,160
This just this sick fuck.

1578
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,720
Yeah, I'm glad I'm not a freak like that.

1579
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,760
But like, God bless him, he's flattening the curve.

1580
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,200
You know, good for him.

1581
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,320
Keep on keeping on.

1582
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,280
But like far away from you got to have

1583
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,720
like an ensemble that works with it.

1584
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,040
Yeah, this guy in this picture.

1585
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,640
Just wearing the fucking Polish.

1586
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,200
It does not look correct.

1587
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,000
No, we're wearing just a shirt.

1588
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,640
He's not he's not he's not prepared for when life attacks.

1589
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,640
He's putting on this mask as a lark.

1590
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,920
This is a joke to him.

1591
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,600
He looks like he's joking around.

1592
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,880
He's dead eyes.

1593
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,240
He's he's he's laughing at us on the inside.

1594
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,800
Man, I never I never posted a picture.

1595
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,960
Of myself wearing the the I have covid shirt.

1596
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,520
And now I don't have covid anymore.

1597
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,840
Oh, did you take a picture?

1598
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,960
Well, no, I didn't.

1599
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,000
I meant to because my dad regifted me the I have covid shirt that I got him.

1600
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,480
He just he just gave it back to me for Christmas

1601
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,120
because I had covid on Christmas and I just thought that was really funny.

1602
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,880
But I never took a picture of it.

1603
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,800
So, I mean, I like I could just put it on and do it now.

1604
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,920
It would be cheating, of course, because I don't actually have covid.

1605
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,240
I could go out and get covid and then just for the bit.

1606
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,440
Like it really just for the pick. Yeah.

1607
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,040
You like cough mid like picture take.

1608
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,600
Somebody I hate I hate to call them out.

1609
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,560
I hate to call them out.

1610
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,600
No, no offense or anything to comment or Gary Hackett.

1611
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,480
But I did see your comment on the last episode asking us to please quit talking

1612
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,560
about covid and I just got to say, man.

1613
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,960
Hey, man, we're living in the real world.

1614
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,280
We're dealing with it.

1615
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,800
You know, this is not a game.

1616
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,000
This is not a joke.

1617
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,480
This is this is reality.

1618
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,440
We're talking about things that exist.

1619
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,080
I'm sorry, covid.

1620
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,920
I wish covid quit would quit talking about us.

1621
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,360
There are lots of terrible things.

1622
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,800
Honestly, I wish people would stop talking about NFTs.

1623
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,280
We're talking about NFTs before.

1624
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,560
Wish people would stop talking about those and they would go away.

1625
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,960
They haven't.

1626
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,600
No, Ben, we're about to talk about NFTs.

1627
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,280
We've got to switch.

1628
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,720
We've got to change topics.

1629
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,720
Right.

1630
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,520
But that's all I think about.

1631
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,080
How about like covid then?

1632
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,240
Yeah, they have a covid better than NFTs.

1633
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,560
I saw a poll on Twitter like which would you you could you could destroy

1634
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,000
one forever, NFTs or or covid?

1635
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,880
And I was like, it's actually covid.

1636
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,720
It's actually kind of hard.

1637
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,120
Is it?

1638
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,800
I don't know.

1639
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,000
covid covid is making everything in the entire world bad.

1640
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,160
OK, it's slightly.

1641
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,200
OK, here's the the question, I guess, is yes.

1642
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,560
Like obviously right now, covid is a bigger problem for me.

1643
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:04,840
But will covid eventually not be such a huge problem?

1644
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:11,560
Whereas NFTs will exist and continue to make the world a worse place forever.

1645
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,080
Right.

1646
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,120
If that's the case, I think maybe there's an argument for NFTs

1647
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,640
being worse in the long haul.

1648
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,760
Sure.

1649
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,080
I mean, you don't know what's going to happen with covid.

1650
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:27,280
It could be a new variant that is 10 times more deadly than the Omicron.

1651
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,480
It's it's bounced back and now it's going to kill everyone again.

1652
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,640
Oh, yeah.

1653
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,640
Did you see there was like a news story I saw that was like.

1654
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,480
This is like a parody.

1655
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,440
This is like a joke.

1656
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,840
Like I couldn't believe this was real.

1657
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,520
It was like, oh, oh, we found it.

1658
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:51,800
They found a a mutant strain that's like covid and Delta like merged into one.

1659
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,520
No, no, no, no, sorry.

1660
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,360
Omicron and Delta merge into one.

1661
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,960
They're calling it Delta Cron.

1662
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,720
It was like, shut up.

1663
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,720
You know, they're not calling it.

1664
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,000
Who's calling it?

1665
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,200
So one guy who's actually you, you, you're calling it this.

1666
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,440
You're calling it that and making and pretending it's news.

1667
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,240
New York Times or the the sun or whoever.

1668
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,880
Shut up.

1669
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,640
Stop it.

1670
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,680
Where's the like the scrotum variant going to come out?

1671
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,440
That's not a Greek letter.

1672
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,040
Yeah, well, Greek people have scrotums.

1673
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,160
I guess some.

1674
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:34,800
Oh, there is.

1675
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,600
Is it up Salon that has like it's like it's a little W.

1676
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,840
Wait, Greek.

1677
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,720
There is one that is a little like round W.

1678
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,800
Kind of looks like a ball sack, I guess.

1679
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,320
Yeah, it is.

1680
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,880
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's lower lower case omega.

1681
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,840
Lower case omega.

1682
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,720
Add total nuts, total and totally nuts.

1683
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,400
There it is.

1684
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,200
So there it is.

1685
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,320
Yeah, Omega variant.

1686
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,760
Omega lol, Omega lol, Omega lol variant is on is on its way, I'm sure.

1687
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,480
I didn't hear about most of these variants.

1688
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,760
I guess we must have gone through a bunch that nobody heard of.

1689
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,520
Oh, well, whatever.

1690
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,200
Yeah, death, you know, the world pandemic cares.

1691
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,840
It is it's pretty it's pretty boring.

1692
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,520
I mean, it is boring, actually.

1693
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,800
It is it is it is what's what's the word I'm looking for?

1694
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,920
Drury Drury.

1695
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,600
Yeah, sure.

1696
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,280
Droll, not Droll.

1697
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,520
Droll means funny.

1698
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,480
Droll, actually.

1699
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,880
Droll means funny, actually.

1700
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,880
I thought Droll was like a dull.

1701
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,920
No, it just sounds like it sounds like it means that.

1702
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,960
But it actually went.

1703
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,920
OK, I think it's because I heard music.

1704
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,480
Yeah, jokes on the Simpsons where someone would say, how Droll?

1705
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,640
And like they say it like that and they say but they say they mean like, oh,

1706
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,200
this is funny, but they're like a boring person with a British accent.

1707
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,360
As all as all British people are Britishism must have been an old person term.

1708
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,920
Yeah, the oldies would say that.

1709
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:13,080
Yeah, the only time I ever heard it in pop culture was someone just someone boring,

1710
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,480
describing something that is boring, but they're saying that it's funny.

1711
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,760
So I think it's like why I got that mixed up.

1712
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,400
Yeah, how how Droll?

1713
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,920
Right.

1714
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,320
How Droll drills you in the head.

1715
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,720
How Droll?

1716
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,800
Hmm, corn cob.

1717
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,480
Don't. I say to the drill instructor,

1718
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,280
don't put on the news that I that I got mad.

1719
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,680
Huh?

1720
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,320
You know, the drill, the drill, the account.

1721
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,520
I was thinking of the tool.

1722
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,720
No, that's that sucks.

1723
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,880
The AI version of drill.

1724
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,320
Can't wait to wear my AI generated drill tweets.

1725
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,440
I've seen a few.

1726
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,040
I think there's a couple different like drill AI accounts.

1727
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,080
How is drill?

1728
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,800
How is drill such a genius?

1729
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,480
How does he just put banger after banger out every day?

1730
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,680
He just has like a different mind, a better mind than the rest of us.

1731
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,600
It's good. It is good.

1732
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,920
He just does things the rest of us can only dream of with language.

1733
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,240
We can't we couldn't do what drill does if we spent a million years practicing.

1734
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,520
It's the way he is.

1735
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,680
Just it's the way he says nutsack and shits out my ass.

1736
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,120
That it's really like I guess.

1737
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:35,920
Yeah, he puts it.

1738
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,200
He puts those words in the perfect context.

1739
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,960
Sure.

1740
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,280
She's his his his his trade his trademark words.

1741
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,320
Uh, man.

1742
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,600
All right, I guess stop looking at Twitter.

1743
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,440
Twitter's dumb. Twitter's bad.

1744
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,080
Uh, there.

1745
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,680
What else happened this week?

1746
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,520
I'm floundering. I'm floundering.

1747
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,720
I'm struggling. I'm struggling.

1748
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,160
I'm struggling to fill time.

1749
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,160
Hey, hey, audience.

1750
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,080
This is me, Ben saying, admitting that I'm just filling time.

1751
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,480
I'm just killing time.

1752
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,040
I'm just here for a paycheck.

1753
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,160
Listen, I don't want to be here.

1754
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,520
I know that you, the listener, don't want to be here listening to this.

1755
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,520
Why don't we just call it?

1756
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,600
Why don't we just as a mutual as a mutual favor to one another?

1757
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,800
I'll stop recording this podcast and you can stop listening.

1758
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,400
Why not?

1759
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,040
I saw on the last episode just came out

1760
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,440
people like, oh, thank God, five hours of PCP content.

1761
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,280
I'm like, Dan, they really, really want those long episodes.

1762
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,040
They do. We've been recording.

1763
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,760
I get it. Oh, no, not even two.

1764
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,280
They're going to kill us. They're going to crucify us.

1765
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,360
Genuinely, yeah, when we now, when we do a two hour episode,

1766
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,320
everyone is like, what the fuck?

1767
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,880
What the fuck? What am I supposed to do on my commute?

1768
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,160
What am I supposed to do on my?

1769
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,320
Yeah, drive quicker.

1770
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,840
Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,960
Make the train go faster.

1772
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,720
Uh, yeah, they, they, they, they love it.

1773
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,640
They love it. But why?

1774
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,480
Why not? Listen, save us all the time.

1775
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,240
Just just go pledge to the Patreon

1776
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,880
and then just click unsubscribe and just forget about it.

1777
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,000
Just forget we exist. All right. Listen, they'll save you the time.

1778
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,880
We won't have to make them anymore.

1779
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,120
Just just pledge and forget your pledged.

1780
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,520
And we can all just we can all just go.

1781
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,760
We can all we can all just you give me money

1782
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,320
and I give you the freedom to not listen to the podcast.

1783
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,040
I give you permission to stop listening.

1784
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,640
I tell you, it's OK to quit. Yeah.

1785
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,320
That's that's the curse.

1786
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,360
You're you're you're you're not you're not actually allowed to stop listening

1787
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,680
unless you have pledged.

1788
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:49,520
It is a it is a transactional transaction.

1789
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,560
It is a it is a deal.

1790
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,640
The deal of a lifetime.

1791
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,760
I mean, I guess the one thing.

1792
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,080
The one other thing you give me five dollars a month,

1793
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,200
you get you receive your life back, your freedom.

1794
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,240
Breaker of chains, yeah.

1795
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,920
Uh, the other thing that I've been thinking about recently,

1796
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,080
because I've been watching Game of Thrones is like a world building.

1797
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,720
And what about the worlds that I must build?

1798
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,520
For my stupid comics that suck? Sure.

1799
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,360
Oh, wouldn't that be great to have all that? Absolutely.

1800
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,560
And I'm like, I go I go on like fantasy map generators

1801
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,560
and I generate a bunch of like, oh, there's rivers here and there's a coastline

1802
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,800
and we've got all these places and I can name them.

1803
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,920
And I'm like, cool, the tools in my disposal to create this world

1804
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,080
in such detail as George R. R. Martin creates his.

1805
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:45,880
What a wonderful world I live in where I can I can make all these things.

1806
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,480
And I just sit there looking at it and like, OK, well, any moment now,

1807
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,040
I'll just make the I'll just do it.

1808
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,440
I'll just make that world.

1809
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:57,040
What do you have like any second like a drawing program open or something?

1810
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,680
I got like a drawing program open.

1811
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,680
I got like documents.

1812
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,960
I'm like, OK, so what are the kingdoms called?

1813
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:07,520
You know, yeah, you know, what?

1814
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,960
You know, I can't probably think of anything good.

1815
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,320
Let's never do anything.

1816
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,200
Let's never do that. Let's never think about that again.

1817
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,920
Absolutely.

1818
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,800
Why is it so hard?

1819
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,320
Why is it so hard to just to just create like a vast network

1820
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,920
of interconnected like kingdoms and empires and and factions

1821
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,800
and characters and and lore and history?

1822
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,920
How's that so hard?

1823
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,680
Why is that? So I kind of be easy.

1824
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,040
Well, I kind of be snap my finger and it's done.

1825
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,120
Oh, it is easy.

1826
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,880
Oh, yeah, it is. You're just dumb.

1827
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,240
That's all.

1828
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,680
No, you're just you you're just uniquely bad at it.

1829
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,960
Everybody, everybody has their own world and the lore.

1830
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,640
And they've all just like, oh, yeah, you know, I I just didn't want to show anyone.

1831
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,320
I made three of those before breakfast.

1832
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,760
What? What are you talking about?

1833
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,160
Everyone's got them in their drawer and they're just like,

1834
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,480
yeah, I don't want to show you and I don't feel like I need to show you.

1835
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:06,880
And you just have to suffer as the only person in the entire world

1836
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,080
who is bad at doing that one thing that everyone else knows.

1837
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,360
Damn.

1838
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,000
Well, you see, it's it's actually because covid shrank the part of your brain

1839
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,560
that is good at making maps and thinking, oh, well,

1840
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,240
well, you better not get it or it'll be even worse.

1841
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,880
Maybe that's why maybe my maybe I need that brain shrinkage

1842
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,360
to increase the efficiency of my neurons.

1843
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,400
Right. You've got too much.

1844
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,400
You've got too much unnecessary padding in there.

1845
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,920
It's it's keeping the world building my brain.

1846
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,080
Deep record with covid.

1847
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:41,840
Oh, just put the new one to each other.

1848
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,440
And it just becomes like a fucking neutron bomb.

1849
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,640
It's just dense like a neutron star.

1850
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:54,600
That's that's what all those like a galaxy brain things mean.

1851
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,600
That's what the image is of is if somebody right.

1852
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,040
You you don't you don't want a big brain.

1853
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,840
You want a small dense brain.

1854
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:06,040
You want it to be you want to be compact is streamlined aerodynamic.

1855
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,200
Sure. What? Why not?

1856
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,440
Oh, that makes me you.

1857
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:19,480
Uh, how is the I won't say any details.

1858
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,080
How is the secret project going?

1859
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,360
You kind of put it aside for December, right?

1860
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,600
Have you been I put it aside for December

1861
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,920
and I was going to I was going to fly out to America.

1862
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,320
But there have been there's been time to work on it a little bit.

1863
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:39,560
Yeah. So it may come out before February, probably in February.

1864
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,080
OK. And it's looking very good.

1865
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,000
It's it's it's it's based.

1866
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,160
It's epic. I was I looked at a tweet by Tom

1867
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,600
who was like saying, oh, it's cool to have like a big project

1868
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:59,560
that you can release in secret, but it's shit for the algorithm.

1869
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,080
Oh, I saw this tweet and I was like, it's true.

1870
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,800
I probably would have more like interest in what I'm doing

1871
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,000
when I release it, if people already were expecting something

1872
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,440
like in you, what they were expecting to release.

1873
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,840
I'll be honest, I'll be honest.

1874
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,040
That tweet that tweet annoyed me.

1875
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,960
I thought I think it's a wrongheaded attitude to take about it.

1876
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,440
I I I feel similar.

1877
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,840
But how am I going to drip feed for the algorithm?

1878
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:32,400
Who cares? I generally agree.

1879
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,720
Because the algorithm is like it's it sucks.

1880
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,520
Even when it's good for you, it's it's never like you're doing.

1881
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,520
It just happens.

1882
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,480
You know, you know, it's more important than drip feeding the algorithm

1883
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,200
having a fucking project that you finished. True.

1884
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,400
That's like 10,000 times more important is making making the thing

1885
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:56,240
not not hurting the thing into a drip feed of algorithm pleasing.

1886
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,880
Yes, or whatever. Yeah.

1887
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,680
Well, that aspect of like using it for the algorithm is is one thing.

1888
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:07,520
But like, I think it's like otherwise generally true

1889
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:13,880
that like or at least it gave me pause to be like,

1890
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,880
should I have like announced this earlier?

1891
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,560
Should I have like given somebody given people something?

1892
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,400
Because I don't think anyone in the entire world is waiting

1893
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,080
and with bated breath about what my secret project is.

1894
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,280
They just know I've said it a few times.

1895
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,840
They're like, yeah, come on, Gabe, just that nobody cares.

1896
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,320
Well, I think it's yeah, I mean, why would they could they don't know what it is?

1897
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,400
They don't know what it is, except a few patrons

1898
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,720
who have listened to the Money Spenders podcast, where I explain it like

1899
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,400
that there's no like images yet.

1900
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,760
Here's here's what I think.

1901
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,600
I think I think it doesn't really matter.

1902
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,560
I think what matters is that when it's out,

1903
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,800
people will like it and be impressed by it.

1904
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,000
That's like so much more important than

1905
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,040
than whatever, you know, that you

1906
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,680
that you drip feed at it or something.

1907
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,040
But it's not that I want to drip feed it for algorithm.

1908
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,080
It's just sort of like, I don't know, sometimes it feels like.

1909
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,800
I'm looking at it and I'm like, this is great.

1910
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,760
This is amazing compared to like what I ever expected it to become.

1911
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,280
But then I'm like, what if it's not amazing enough for anyone to give a shit?

1912
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,240
Maybe we should work on this for another 20 years and never talk about it.

1913
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,440
No, we shouldn't do that.

1914
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,360
We should release it soon, sooner rather than later.

1915
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:41,400
Release and like, I guess I guess I have the same sort of thoughts

1916
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,360
about like Phantoms Revenge.

1917
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,880
Like, I think it's I think it's great.

1918
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,960
I think it's a masterpiece.

1919
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,960
But is it like?

1920
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,200
But is it? But is it like such harsh critics?

1921
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,000
Well, OK, they see something that you worked really hard on.

1922
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,600
And they don't know about that.

1923
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:02,280
And they just sort of like, well, I'd rather play this other game that came out.

1924
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,400
Right. Yeah.

1925
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,320
And like that.

1926
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,240
Yeah, it's kind of bad.

1927
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,760
And I'm like, oh, that's going to happen to me.

1928
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,080
It's not. Of course it would.

1929
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,960
It's not that I'm worried that people will like say it's bad.

1930
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:16,680
It's that the worst thing would be if like people are just like,

1931
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,280
what is this? I don't get it. I don't care.

1932
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,520
You know, if it just if it just gets no attention, which is like,

1933
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,760
yeah, that could happen.

1934
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,200
Yeah, it could happen.

1935
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,120
Uh, I think I mean, I think it's good.

1936
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,200
I think it deserves.

1937
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,800
I think it deserves some attention.

1938
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,880
And I think if I just if I just, I don't know, I'll just talk about it a lot.

1939
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:41,680
I'll just like, I'll put it in front of people to the best extent that I can.

1940
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,360
And I think and I think it's good enough and cool enough.

1941
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:50,320
And there's enough in it that even if it's not like a smash hit or anything,

1942
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,640
which like it won't be, but like, I don't know.

1943
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,840
I think I think I think some people will will take notice and be like,

1944
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,720
hey, this guy made a pretty good little video game.

1945
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,400
Which, you know, what more can I ask for money?

1946
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,840
Well, yeah, yeah, money, please.

1947
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:14,800
Yeah, that's that's the my secret project is like, I don't know.

1948
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:20,360
It's it's just closer to being releasable than it was before.

1949
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,800
Sure. I'm going to be working on it tomorrow.

1950
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:28,080
I have been I have not really been doing any work on Phantom's revenge

1951
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,360
because it's it's basically done.

1952
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:34,640
It actually needs what it needs is work done on converting it

1953
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:38,280
to an HTML version that can like play in browser.

1954
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:42,000
Because when I try to play it HTML in browser, it like is is

1955
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,480
fucked up and broken for some reason.

1956
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,760
And I need to figure out why that is.

1957
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,280
So that's kind of important.

1958
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,080
Yeah. So that's kind of important.

1959
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:57,120
But then also, I've been making like an itch page for it, you know.

1960
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:03,040
And so that's something that that's like, I think that's like mostly done.

1961
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,400
Yeah, the page is basically looking fine.

1962
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:09,400
Yeah, I got I'm putting off the fucking HTML.

1963
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,760
Port, because that's like, it's going to be really fucking boring.

1964
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,400
You're really fucking boring work that I don't want to.

1965
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,320
I just don't want to do it.

1966
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,640
I don't like I have no idea what's broken about it.

1967
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:25,160
So I don't even know like where to start looking.

1968
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,560
And I'm like, God, I hope it doesn't take me like two fucking weeks

1969
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:34,200
of like work on it, just like just to make it work in another application.

1970
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,200
Like that would suck.

1971
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,720
But that's sometimes how it is.

1972
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:41,560
Yeah, and getting things to work somewhere else.

1973
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,080
I'm just really confused.

1974
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,000
Like it's breaking in like weird ways that don't make any sense.

1975
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,840
And I'm like, why?

1976
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,680
Like, why are you doing that?

1977
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,880
For instance, in this is just one problem.

1978
01:40:54,240 --> 01:41:00,520
The title screen, the title fades in from zero opacity to max opacity.

1979
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,680
Right. That's it.

1980
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,920
It just it fades in.

1981
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:11,080
On HTML, it fades in and then it blinks back to zero.

1982
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,560
And it starts like kind of fading in and then blinking back and fading in

1983
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,400
and then blinking out and fading in. And it's like, are you joking?

1984
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:21,640
Why are you literally like, why do you not know how to count?

1985
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,640
Why does the function not know how to count in HTML?

1986
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,760
What the fuck?

1987
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,600
Just very bizarre.

1988
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,720
So I'm not looking forward to it.

1989
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,400
OK, anyway, the sort of thing you never think about.

1990
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,680
No, I need the assets.

1991
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,080
I need the code and the things to work.

1992
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,880
No, I kind of thought I kind of thought it would just work.

1993
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,920
Well, sure. But like, yeah.

1994
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:55,040
There's so much about game development that's like invisible.

1995
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:59,920
Yeah, like hours upon hours to make sure that when you press the menu button,

1996
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,480
it does, in fact, open the menu. Yes.

1997
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:06,080
It's true. It's it's sad.

1998
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,960
But and then and then people aren't like impressed by that.

1999
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,320
They're just like, they want it to work.

2000
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:13,120
And if it doesn't work, they're going to piss their pants and scream.

2001
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,600
Because of course they should.

2002
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:19,800
Was that I think I think I think Brian Leo Malley on like form spring or something.

2003
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,480
Someone asked him he was just answering people's questions.

2004
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,080
And he said like he said something like

2005
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,840
like like comics are really hard, like they're a lot of work.

2006
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,840
Like every time you finish a page of a comic, it's like you feel

2007
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,160
like you did so much like they should throw you a parade

2008
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,200
because just because you finished one page.

2009
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
But like, of course, nobody does.

2010
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,480
And you just got to finish the next bit.

2011
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,240
You got to make hundreds of pages before you're actually done.

2012
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,440
That's how it feels. Right.

2013
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,600
Game dev stuff, you make you make you make

2014
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,400
you take a menu and you add like one more option to the menu.

2015
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,600
You make you make the menu scroll.

2016
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,680
And it's like I deserve a fucking monument built in my honor

2017
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,480
in the in Central Park for this.

2018
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,000
This was this was the hardest thing in the world.

2019
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,720
But it's but it's completely invisible on the user end.

2020
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,480
It's it's it's it's, you know, it's if it's designed well.

2021
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,440
They don't even notice it. Right.

2022
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:21,880
It's invisible. Yeah.

2023
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,240
But I mean. Yeah.

2024
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,400
I guess I guess all I can hope for is that, you know,

2025
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,200
to typical rubes, typical laypeople will probably

2026
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,840
will probably not appreciate all the effort that goes into making a game.

2027
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,440
But I mean, and how would they? Right.

2028
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,920
How would they know? How would they know? No, it's silly to expect them.

2029
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,280
But you feel it in your gut when they like

2030
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,160
when like a tiny problem.

2031
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,840
Yeah, is the thing they they like, oh, that's terrible.

2032
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,240
But you like you spent so long to try and get it even to that point.

2033
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,240
It was so much worse before.

2034
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:00,960
So many so many difficult things that go unappreciated.

2035
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:05,040
But the final product is the only thing that really matters.

2036
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,120
It does.

2037
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,400
But I guess something that I can hope for is that maybe other people

2038
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,600
who make who make their own games might see the game and be like, oh,

2039
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:18,080
well, there's there's like, you know, I understand how much

2040
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,120
how much must have gone into this.

2041
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,400
Like this is more complicated than it looks.

2042
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,120
Yeah, there's a lot of like art people who are like

2043
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,520
impressed with other art people who follow art people.

2044
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,720
And they're all talking about art and knowing about how it's created.

2045
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,200
And sometimes it's like there's so many art people, especially on Twitter.

2046
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,640
It's like, are there any like normal peers or any like normal people? No, no.

2047
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,800
Any any rubes, any any lay people?

2048
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:51,800
Yeah, any any filthy peasants who don't know how to hold a pencil?

2049
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,240
Hey, if you're a rub, DM me.

2050
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,480
Any rubes, rubes in the audience hit me up and

2051
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,000
tell me about tell me about that.

2052
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,680
Tell me about your Rube Goldberg machine.

2053
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:19,040
Man, Phantom's Revenge, Big Effort Post, Big Effort Post.

2054
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,240
Worth it? I don't know.

2055
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,240
I just I just don't know.

2056
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:32,640
Maybe perhaps one day, perhaps one day, I will have achieved something in my life.

2057
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:38,640
And I will look back and say, oh, yeah, you know, things really turned around for me.

2058
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:44,640
I think it was after I think it was after I spent a year making that game and I released that game.

2059
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:53,640
And, you know, through some through some through some series of consequences of having done that that at the time I could never have foreseen.

2060
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:59,640
You know, things really started to look up and change change the course of my life.

2061
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:04,640
And now I'm and now I'm like and now I'm now I'm worth something.

2062
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:08,640
That would be nice. A man can dream.

2063
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:14,640
I think I mean, it's easy to be cynical about your own achievements.

2064
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:23,640
But I think I've already kind of done that when I like made Balejape because it's like before that I was like a hobbyist artist.

2065
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,640
I drew occasionally. I used to draw at school, but I was making videos.

2066
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,640
I was like, I'm going to make a videos forever.

2067
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:36,640
I feel like if I had stayed on that path, my life would be cringe.

2068
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:40,640
Maybe I would have loads of subscribers or maybe not.

2069
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:44,640
And maybe it would be like the same amount of money, maybe a lot more.

2070
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:49,640
But I feel like I still would have eventually realized I didn't like it.

2071
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,640
I'm glad I'm glad I have, you know, a comic under my belt already.

2072
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:58,640
People like it and they remember it and they like the character and it's like, that's great.

2073
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,640
There's parts of it I don't like.

2074
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:09,640
There's parts of it that are stupid and bad, but like that, it's a good moment in my art career.

2075
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:14,640
They decided to do that and now I'm doing comics. I'm doing things like that.

2076
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,640
It can lead to bigger and better things right now.

2077
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,640
Nothing has come of it really.

2078
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,640
Nothing like substantial life changing.

2079
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,640
I like the direction I'm going, I guess.

2080
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,640
Yeah.

2081
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,640
I don't know.

2082
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:34,640
I feel like...

2083
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:45,640
What's this thought that's coagulating that I'm trying to express?

2084
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,640
It's like, I think...

2085
01:47:50,640 --> 01:48:00,640
I guess I already feel like I can make anything that I put my mind to.

2086
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:08,640
I don't feel like I'm not where I need to be artistically or anything.

2087
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:19,640
Not that I couldn't grow as an artist or anything like that, but I don't feel like I need to grow more before I can do the things I want to do.

2088
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,640
I'm there. I'm good enough for everything.

2089
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:36,640
All that's left to me now is to just continue to do stuff, make things that I want to be making, whatever those are.

2090
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,640
That's all sorted.

2091
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:51,640
The only other thing to think about is power, accruing power to crush my enemies while I continue to do that sort of thing on my own.

2092
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,640
To get a big break?

2093
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,640
Yeah.

2094
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:57,640
I don't know.

2095
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,640
I don't know. Heck, job storyboarding for a show or something.

2096
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,640
That would be cool.

2097
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Something like that.

2098
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:13,640
That's probably the only way that I could get some sort of big break.

2099
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:17,640
Storyboard for a show or something.

2100
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:27,640
The kind of artists that I know of who have gotten storyboarding gigs were way more successful than I am.

2101
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:37,640
People someone might have actually heard of, someone like Ryan Pequen got a job storyboarding on a regular show.

2102
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:49,640
You either got to have industry connections, it seems, or you actually have to be not zealust like Ben St. Famous.

2103
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,640
And I say that word with disdain.

2104
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,640
I spit that word in that contest.

2105
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:58,640
You have to have a real following.

2106
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,640
You have to be like a real guy.

2107
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,640
And frankly, I'm just not a real guy.

2108
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,640
I just can't do it.

2109
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,640
It's all been for nothing.

2110
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,640
So you think simultaneously that you can do anything, but that you're nothing as well?

2111
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:16,640
Ability-wise, I can do anything.

2112
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:20,640
Clout-wise, power-wise, I have nothing.

2113
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:23,640
That's how it feels.

2114
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:28,640
I'm held back just because nobody knows who I am.

2115
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,640
That's the worst thing.

2116
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,640
You've got a million-view video. Some people know who you are.

2117
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,640
It's just not, I don't know.

2118
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:40,640
Okay, the Sonichu video is fine and all.

2119
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:42,640
Yeah, some people know who I am because of that video.

2120
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:49,640
I don't think that video's existence earns me a lot of respect.

2121
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:51,640
You know what I mean?

2122
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,640
It's a Chris Chan video.

2123
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:58,640
And Chris Chan is literally the lowest hanging fruit on the whole internet.

2124
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:05,640
I think I would be lucky for someone with connections to be like,

2125
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,640
Oh, Ben St., you mean the Sonichu lecture guy?

2126
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,640
Yeah.

2127
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,640
I'm neutral about that, right?

2128
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:19,640
I think that's, you know, you know what I fucking mean.

2129
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,640
I know.

2130
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,640
I mean, I can't really relate because I've always had less clout than anyone.

2131
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,640
I don't feel like I have much clout.

2132
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,640
That's what I'm saying.

2133
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,640
I just don't feel like I have clout.

2134
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,640
I need it.

2135
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,640
I need it to hurt people that deserve it.

2136
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,640
I don't know.

2137
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,640
Go to the clout mines.

2138
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,640
I guess.

2139
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,640
Chisel some out.

2140
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,640
I guess.

2141
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:52,640
I don't know.

2142
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,640
Oh, you gotta feed that algorithm.

2143
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:57,640
Yeah.

2144
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,640
Gotta drip feed that content.

2145
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,640
Drip feed game dev vlogs.

2146
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:04,640
Game dev vlogs.

2147
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:06,640
Game dev vlogs.

2148
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,640
GIFs dev vlogs.

2149
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,640
I don't know.

2150
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:17,640
I feel maybe it's because I haven't had like a large clout.

2151
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,640
Exactly.

2152
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,640
I've had like a middling sort of size and it's like, that's pretty cool.

2153
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,640
I don't feel like I need to be like big.

2154
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,640
Of course, money is always nice.

2155
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:31,640
So that would be good.

2156
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:36,640
I need to be bigger, but I don't want to do any of the things.

2157
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:38,640
Well, same.

2158
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:44,640
That's why it's like, oh, in order to like maximize your chances of getting all this clout,

2159
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:47,640
you've got to do stuff that makes you miserable.

2160
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,640
I'm like, God damn it.

2161
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,640
No.

2162
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:53,640
Honestly, I don't even know.

2163
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,640
Honestly, I say that like, that's not even true.

2164
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,640
I don't even know.

2165
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,640
I don't even know like what I would need to do.

2166
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:05,640
If I wanted to sell out and get clout and become a big guy,

2167
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,640
I genuinely don't even know what I would need to do.

2168
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:17,640
Well, you got to have a clear like thing you do.

2169
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:19,640
When people say Ben St, they think of what?

2170
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,640
Exactly.

2171
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,640
Exactly.

2172
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:28,640
That you got to have a very clear thing and then do collabs with people in the same field

2173
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:34,640
until it's really like that seems to be what people do a lot.

2174
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:38,640
Or they just get lucky and people find them anyway.

2175
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,640
Yeah.

2176
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,640
Yeah.

2177
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,640
I don't know.

2178
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,640
So I don't know long story short.

2179
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:55,640
I'm just, I think I've had the same spiel before.

2180
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:03,640
Just about how mad I am that I'm not more powerful.

2181
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:05,640
You got to lift.

2182
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,640
Oh, I haven't lifted in like three weeks.

2183
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,640
That's the, that's the feeling.

2184
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,640
I stopped for COVID and I have not resumed.

2185
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:15,640
I mean, I do have to lift.

2186
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,640
If I can't have social power, then I'll become physically more powerful.

2187
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:21,640
I mean, why not?

2188
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:27,640
I had, man, I was almost, I was almost up to deadlifting 300.

2189
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,640
I'm sure I've lost like a ton off it now.

2190
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,640
I'm going to have to reset down to like some bullshit, like 250 or something.

2191
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,640
Maybe even lower.

2192
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:37,640
I don't know.

2193
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,640
Oh, well.

2194
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,640
Oh, well, I'll get some fun.

2195
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,640
I'll get some fun easy gains getting back to where I was.

2196
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,640
I'll be, that'll be, that'll be a hoot.

2197
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:54,640
I still have those sort of naive, like youthful imagination moments where I'm like,

2198
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,640
oh, what if, what if, what if, what if Clarissa became like a cartoon and she was on TV?

2199
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,640
That would be fucking sick.

2200
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,640
Oh my God, people would like Clarissa.

2201
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,640
And then I would go on to rule 34 and I would find rule 34 for her.

2202
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,640
And it would be like, I've made it.

2203
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,640
People are doing that of their own volition.

2204
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:15,640
Yeah.

2205
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:23,640
I don't really, I wouldn't really be, I mean, God, if someone came up to me and was like,

2206
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,640
hey, Ben, this thing you made, we want to make a fucking TV show about it.

2207
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,640
I mean, I'd be like, great.

2208
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,640
Amazing.

2209
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:34,640
I wouldn't really be like, I don't know, I wouldn't, it wouldn't feel.

2210
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,640
You wouldn't talk about it?

2211
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:41,640
I mean, I wouldn't, but I wouldn't be like, oh yeah, I want the thing to be on television.

2212
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:46,640
I would be like, hey, if you want to do that, like it's not my thing, right?

2213
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,640
Cause it's like, I wouldn't be making the show.

2214
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,640
I guess maybe if they asked me, like, we want you to be, to work on the show,

2215
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:54,640
to produce it for television.

2216
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:59,640
I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be like, oh yeah, I want the thing to be on television.

2217
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:01,640
On the show to produce it for television.

2218
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,640
I'd be like, sure, yeah, I'd do that.

2219
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,640
And then maybe I would be excited about the product because it's like, okay,

2220
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,640
this is what I am thinking.

2221
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,640
That's what I was thinking.

2222
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:14,640
I would have my Clarissa character comic books and it's like,

2223
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:18,640
we want to turn this into a thing and maybe put on Netflix or whatever the fuck.

2224
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:23,640
And I'm like, oh, oh yeah, I'll be the director and I'll tell people what to do.

2225
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:28,640
And I'll look at, I'll say this voice actor would be great for this character

2226
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,640
and say, okay, we'll see if we can get him.

2227
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,640
I can't wait.

2228
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,640
It's definitely going to happen in my head, in my fantasy.

2229
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,640
Can we get Frankie Muniz as the bandit king?

2230
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,640
Yes?

2231
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:43,640
I don't know who that is.

2232
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:45,640
I think I'm saying his name right.

2233
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,640
It's the kid who played Malcolm in the middle.

2234
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:49,640
I say kid, he's probably like 30 now.

2235
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,640
I can't remember his voice.

2236
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,640
You know Malcolm in the middle?

2237
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,640
I do.

2238
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,640
I've watched it many a time when I was younger.

2239
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,640
He's 36.

2240
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:01,640
That sounds about right.

2241
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,640
He's got like brain cancer or something or he's got some kind of like,

2242
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:08,640
he's got some kind of like brain problem.

2243
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,640
Too big, probably.

2244
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:14,640
He needs COVID.

2245
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,640
Okay, but has he tried it though?

2246
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:20,640
Don't knock it until you try it.

2247
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,640
True.

2248
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,640
Man.

2249
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,640
Well, that was a tangent.

2250
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,640
I don't even remember how we got on this topic.

2251
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,640
Talking about projects and stuff.

2252
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:41,640
Oh yeah, talking about Secret Project in January and whatnot.

2253
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:46,640
I guess that rules out my Secret Project being a Clarissa television show,

2254
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,640
if I've said that now.

2255
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:50,640
It's not that.

2256
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:55,640
Damn, I said I hoped to maybe get Phantom's Revenge released in January.

2257
01:57:55,640 --> 01:58:00,640
And with like the HTML version being all like, fucky, I just don't know.

2258
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:03,640
I just don't know if it'll be possible or not.

2259
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:05,640
Like I have no idea.

2260
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,640
I won't know how long that's going to take to fix until it's fixed.

2261
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:12,640
But, oh well.

2262
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,640
In the meantime, I have been selling,

2263
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,640
I have been selling Blu-rays.

2264
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,640
I've sold maybe like, probably like 55 or something.

2265
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:21,640
In total?

2266
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,640
Something like that.

2267
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,640
Probably, yeah.

2268
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,640
I made a few more, I think I made a few more.

2269
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:33,640
A few more people asked me for them after the last PCP came out.

2270
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,640
Like a handful of other people messaged me.

2271
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,640
So, pretty good.

2272
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:44,640
It's definitely justified itself as an endeavor.

2273
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:49,640
Like I said, I've got a big stack of them right here.

2274
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:52,640
And as soon as this episode is over, I have to get back to,

2275
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:55,640
I have another one in the burner and burn.

2276
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:00,640
Yeah, I think I got like four more to go or something.

2277
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:10,640
Okay, suddenly unlocked a memory of like every computer in the house

2278
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:14,640
burning a DVD for something because we were making DVDs.

2279
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:18,640
Were you like converting like VHS tapes to DVD or something?

2280
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:20,640
No.

2281
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:24,640
It was, okay, you know the agunary thing I do?

2282
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,640
Yeah.

2283
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:29,640
Haven't done it for past few years because of COVID.

2284
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,640
Yeah, true.

2285
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:39,640
But for a while there have been like, all the scout camp leaders,

2286
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:42,640
they get like a little digital camera and a little video camera

2287
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,640
that they can record things with.

2288
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:49,640
And we used to make DVDs for the camp mates to like,

2289
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,640
oh, this is what happened on all these days.

2290
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:53,640
And here's some, so a slideshow and a thing.

2291
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,640
Yeah, sure.

2292
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:57,640
And we were making DVDs for everyone.

2293
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:00,640
And that's a nice memory for some reason.

2294
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:03,640
All the houses is like, okay, mom and dad got a computer,

2295
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:05,640
I got a computer, gotta get all the computers,

2296
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,640
make a bunch of DVDs with them.

2297
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:13,640
Man, just imagine how shit it would be

2298
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,640
to have someone, to be like a caregiver for like,

2299
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:19,640
someone who's like, you know, learning disabled

2300
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,640
or like mentally impaired or something.

2301
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:27,640
And like, you have to like, you have to like take care of them

2302
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:30,640
like through COVID and like keep them like,

2303
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,640
Oh, god.

2304
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,640
You gotta make them comply with fucking CDC regulations

2305
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,640
and like explain shit to them.

2306
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,640
And like, they gotta deal with it.

2307
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:42,640
And you gotta deal with it.

2308
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,640
Wow.

2309
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:46,640
It's terrible.

2310
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,640
It would suck.

2311
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:50,640
It'd be so fucking bad.

2312
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:53,640
I'm sure like carers have like,

2313
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:59,640
they're allowed to visit the houses of people they give care to,

2314
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:02,640
like elderly people or people with disabilities.

2315
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,640
They should wear a mask and isolate with them or something.

2316
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,640
Of course.

2317
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,640
But it would be very, I mean, I'm sure when it was like

2318
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:15,640
lockdown in the UK, you couldn't go anywhere.

2319
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:18,640
You couldn't go outside unless you were exercising

2320
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,640
or shopping for food.

2321
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:27,640
And it's like, that would have been the worst for everyone,

2322
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,640
but especially disabled people.

2323
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:34,640
Man, lockdown was awesome.

2324
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,640
We should go back.

2325
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,640
Lockdown was great.

2326
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,640
No worries.

2327
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:42,640
Never had to worry about what you were doing.

2328
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,640
Never had to worry about looking like a loser.

2329
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,640
You were doing nothing.

2330
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,640
Never had to worry about looking like a loser

2331
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:50,640
because you got no plans on a Friday night.

2332
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:52,640
Now those were the days.

2333
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,640
Well, it's the same as normal.

2334
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,640
It's just that nobody expects you to have plans.

2335
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,640
Right, exactly.

2336
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,640
I mean, yeah.

2337
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:03,640
It's like, what are you doing this Friday?

2338
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,640
Oh, you know, interesting things and stuff

2339
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,640
that you wouldn't possibly understand.

2340
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,640
What I'm saying is back during lockdown,

2341
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:13,640
nobody asked that question.

2342
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:17,640
And that was just the way I liked it, actually.

2343
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,640
Every time somebody says,

2344
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,640
hey, are you doing something later?

2345
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,640
You should say, yeah, I'm going to kill you.

2346
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:30,640
Yeah, I'm going to.

2347
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:32,640
Yes, I'm going to kill you.

2348
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,640
You're going to die.

2349
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:36,640
Hmm.

2350
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,640
Fascinating.

2351
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:43,640
That's another way to make people stop asking.

2352
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:47,640
Hmm.

2353
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:54,640
Well, yeah, I'm lost in the sea.

2354
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,640
Lost at sea.

2355
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,640
I'm also lost at sea by Brian.

2356
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,640
Leo Malley.

2357
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:02,640
Not Brian Clevenger, Brian Leo Malley.

2358
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:03,640
Not the same.

2359
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,640
Very different.

2360
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,640
Very different.

2361
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,640
You know who Brian Clevenger is?

2362
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,640
Nope.

2363
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,640
He was the artist of the Sprite comic called the 8-Bit Theater.

2364
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:16,640
I don't know if you've ever heard of 8-Bit Theater.

2365
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:19,640
I don't know what it is, but I think I've heard it.

2366
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:23,640
It's a Sprite comic with the Sprites from the original Final Fantasy.

2367
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:28,640
There's Black Mage and Red Mage and Thief and so on.

2368
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:30,640
Right.

2369
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:31,640
White Mage.

2370
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:33,640
It's those guys.

2371
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:35,640
It was fine and all.

2372
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:37,640
He wrote a book.

2373
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,640
And because I read his webcomic, I bought his book.

2374
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,640
And his book sucks.

2375
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:47,640
It was called Nuclear Age, I think it was called.

2376
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,640
It was about a superhero and it was fucking bad.

2377
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,640
Even as a kid, I was like, wow, this is bad.

2378
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:55,640
This is like a bad.

2379
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,640
I'm not finishing this.

2380
02:03:58,640 --> 02:03:59,640
Give me a break.

2381
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,640
Yeah.

2382
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:03,640
Do you want to go to voicemails?

2383
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,640
Yes.

2384
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,640
Run out of topics.

2385
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:09,640
Yeah, let's do it.

2386
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,640
You just ran out of the unimportant ones.

2387
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:16,640
They're keeping your synapses far apart.

2388
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:19,640
Making it take too long to think.

2389
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,640
Alright, let's do it.

2390
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:27,640
The first one is an image link.

2391
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,640
Let's see.

2392
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,640
Alright.

2393
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:35,640
It's okay, I got to look at the big version.

2394
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:37,640
Ben, we need to talk.

2395
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,640
It's Tom and me and Ben.

2396
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:41,640
Ben, we need to talk.

2397
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,640
Sure, I look so happy.

2398
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:46,640
Gib and I are thinking of leaving the PCP.

2399
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,640
Okay.

2400
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:50,640
Huh, you're not mad.

2401
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:53,640
Why would I be mad?

2402
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:56,640
I don't want to keep you here against your will.

2403
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:58,640
Then it's settled.

2404
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,640
The podcast is over.

2405
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:02,640
Over?

2406
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,640
The podcast will go on.

2407
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:09,640
I'm not sure what...

2408
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,640
Wait.

2409
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,640
What is this?

2410
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:15,640
Is it...

2411
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:18,640
Yeah, probably.

2412
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,640
The nostalgia critic camp, so it's probably...

2413
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,640
The podcast will go on.

2414
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:26,640
Those eyes, those little eyes of mine,

2415
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:29,640
that's my face when the podcast will go on.

2416
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:31,640
No matter what.

2417
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,640
Sure, I'll keep the podcast running until I'm dead.

2418
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,640
What else am I going to do?

2419
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,640
I appreciate this.

2420
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:41,640
This is funny.

2421
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:42,640
This is nice.

2422
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:43,640
It is funny.

2423
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,640
I like that I have a color.

2424
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,640
Ben, your color is black.

2425
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,640
Tom's is gray, I guess.

2426
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:49,640
Should I make Tom red?

2427
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:50,640
Tom's color is red.

2428
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,640
Tom's color is red, but...

2429
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:55,640
I don't see him wearing red.

2430
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:57,640
You just turned into a skull.

2431
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,640
And Tom turned into...

2432
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,640
An old Chinese man?

2433
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,640
Yeah.

2434
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:05,640
Sure.

2435
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:07,640
Just like in real life.

2436
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:16,640
Well, hey, another fucking masterpiece of a voicemail.

2437
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,640
Okay, the next one is called...

2438
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,640
What is that noise?

2439
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,640
Three, two, one, go.

2440
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:25,640
Do you guys remember the yellow argument?

2441
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,640
Good times.

2442
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,640
Good times.

2443
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:30,640
I don't know.

2444
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:32,640
Is it like jacking off or something?

2445
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,640
It didn't sound like anything.

2446
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,640
It just sounds like you're hitting something.

2447
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,640
I do remember the yellow argument.

2448
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,640
Sure, I remember the yellow argument.

2449
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:44,640
Stupid.

2450
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:46,640
The thing I remember most from the yellow argument,

2451
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,640
from my perspective, is that I tried to play cold play yellow,

2452
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,640
but I didn't know how to play it.

2453
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:53,640
And I fucked it up.

2454
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,640
I thought it would have been funnier if I had played it better.

2455
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:59,640
Oh, like you're talking about on the episode?

2456
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:03,640
On the episode, I brought out my guitar and I started playing cold plays yellow.

2457
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:05,640
I'll be honest, I wouldn't recognize that song.

2458
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,640
Wait, wait, wait.

2459
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:08,640
No, yes, I would.

2460
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,640
And it was...

2461
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:10,640
Yeah.

2462
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,640
It was for you.

2463
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,640
Yeah.

2464
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,640
And it was all yellow.

2465
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:21,640
Yeah, I might not have recognized that song if it was just on an acoustic guitar.

2466
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:24,640
Yeah, it was probably inaudible.

2467
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:26,640
But I remember being like, oh, I'm so embarrassed.

2468
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:28,640
I didn't figure out the chords quickly enough.

2469
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:30,640
I didn't want the moment to pass.

2470
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,640
Oh, it was so bad.

2471
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,640
Alas, alas.

2472
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:39,640
Well, road's not taken, traveled.

2473
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,640
Next one is called Ben St. at Night.

2474
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:45,640
Three, two, one, go.

2475
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,640
It's just a scratch.

2476
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,640
I don't get it.

2477
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,640
Again, was it was it jacking off?

2478
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,640
Was the sound jacking off?

2479
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:58,640
Everything sounds like jacking off to me.

2480
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,640
It doesn't.

2481
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:05,640
It was just like somebody rubbing like a piece of plastic against another piece of plastic

2482
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,640
or some sort of rough surface.

2483
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:07,640
Well, the first one.

2484
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:08,640
I don't get it.

2485
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:11,640
The first one was rubbing, but then at the end there was a little like...

2486
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,640
A couple little smacking sound?

2487
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,640
I don't know.

2488
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:15,640
I don't know.

2489
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,640
I don't get it.

2490
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,640
It's too subtle.

2491
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,640
This comedy is too subtle for me.

2492
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:19,640
Absolutely.

2493
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:22,640
Delight like most comedy.

2494
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:25,640
Next voicemail is called Hi.

2495
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,640
Three, two, one, go.

2496
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,640
Next voicemail is called Hi.

2497
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,640
Three, two, one, go.

2498
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,640
Is it incredibly quiet for you as well?

2499
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,640
I could hear something?

2500
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,640
It's like a mouse taking a bite of a cookie.

2501
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,640
That's the sort of sound it was.

2502
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,640
All right.

2503
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:55,640
Well, thanks for the fucking voicemail, Joker.

2504
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,640
All right.

2505
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:57,640
Little mouse.

2506
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,640
Next one is an image.

2507
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,640
Okay.

2508
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,640
Here we go.

2509
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,640
Oh, okay.

2510
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,640
Low energy talking, true.

2511
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,640
Oh, it's me and Ben, low energy talking.

2512
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:12,640
Ben and Tom, doom and gloom talking.

2513
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:14,640
Everything is fucked.

2514
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:16,640
I believe that's true.

2515
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:20,640
Gib and Tom, very nice episode without Ben's bullshit.

2516
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,640
Unfortunately, it happened only once.

2517
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,640
Yeah, true, true.

2518
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,640
Ben, Gib and Tom, PCP at its peak.

2519
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:30,640
All annoying hosts are gone, not including Mage.

2520
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,640
All right, Mage is right.

2521
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:34,640
Oh, I see.

2522
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:35,640
Yeah, master risk.

2523
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:36,640
Yeah.

2524
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:40,640
Ben, Gib, Tom and guests, what the PCP used to be.

2525
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:44,640
Just Ben, shit episode, but seeing him alone is extremely funny.

2526
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,640
I listen.

2527
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:49,640
I agree with most of these.

2528
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:53,640
I do agree with, I mean, I don't remember the one that was just you and Tom.

2529
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:55,640
I have no opinion about that.

2530
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:58,640
My bullshit is great, actually, and you'd miss it.

2531
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:00,640
You'd miss it if it was gone.

2532
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,640
I can't remember what we talked about on that.

2533
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:07,640
I think it was mostly about art stuff, which is, I guess, my favorite conversation topic,

2534
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,640
because I'm always creating.

2535
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:11,640
I'm always thinking about creating.

2536
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:17,640
I think what the PCP used to be is just anytime we have a bunch of guests,

2537
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:22,640
like a bunch of guests, like Cybershell, Oblivion, Fall, Fisnaker.

2538
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:25,640
It felt like the old PCP, because I was like,

2539
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,640
When we have like seven.

2540
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:27,640
Okay, I'll say something now.

2541
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,640
Oh, wait, no, I can't speak.

2542
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:30,640
There's too many people speaking over me.

2543
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:31,640
Okay, I'll be quiet.

2544
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,640
Yeah.

2545
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,640
I'll wait.

2546
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,640
Classic PCP moment.

2547
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:38,640
Classic magical moments.

2548
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,640
All right.

2549
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:41,640
Yeah, good.

2550
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,640
It's true.

2551
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,640
It's all true.

2552
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,640
All right.

2553
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:47,640
Next one is another image thrown up.

2554
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:48,640
What is this?

2555
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:53,640
Okay.

2556
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:56,640
It's okay.

2557
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:58,640
Oh, this is about the logo.

2558
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,640
This is about the Shekels for Heckels logo.

2559
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:01,640
Right?

2560
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:05,640
Oh, okay.

2561
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,640
Sure.

2562
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,640
Alpha Libra.

2563
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,640
It looks like an F, though.

2564
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:11,640
That's why I put it for the F.

2565
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,640
Oh, I see.

2566
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,640
I never even thought about it.

2567
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,640
I never even thought about it, but...

2568
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:21,640
Yeah.

2569
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:23,640
Yeah, I mean, I...

2570
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,640
Yeah, okay.

2571
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,640
I mean, he's got a point, I guess.

2572
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:27,640
Hang on.

2573
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:31,640
But they changed the Euro to be the E.

2574
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:34,640
But it looks more like a C, which is why I put it for the C.

2575
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:36,640
But they didn't replace the other E's,

2576
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,640
or the other L with the Libra.

2577
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:41,640
So what's the choices?

2578
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,640
What's the choices?

2579
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,640
Yeah, all the S's should be dollars.

2580
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,640
All the E's should be Euros, I guess.

2581
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,640
It should be like a typing quirk.

2582
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,640
Really hard to read.

2583
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:54,640
All the L's should be whatever.

2584
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:55,640
Libras.

2585
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:57,640
That would be a pretty good typing quirk

2586
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:00,640
for a greedy capitalist troll.

2587
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:05,640
Every currency symbol that looks like a letter

2588
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,640
he just uses in place of that letter.

2589
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,640
Oh, the Yen would be a perfect Y.

2590
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:10,640
Exactly.

2591
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:14,640
Pokedollars, of course, would make a great P for pounds.

2592
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:21,640
I wonder how many currencies of signal or signs there are.

2593
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,640
There's ones that aren't used anymore, like the Frank.

2594
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,640
There must be...

2595
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:27,640
I don't even know what the sign is.

2596
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,640
Right, right.

2597
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:31,640
There must be so fucking many.

2598
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:36,640
I wouldn't be surprised if you could fill most of the alphabet with them.

2599
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,640
There's probably a few that they don't have.

2600
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:42,640
There's probably none that's like an X.

2601
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:43,640
No, maybe.

2602
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:44,640
I don't know.

2603
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,640
There's probably some crypto that's X.

2604
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:47,640
Oh yeah, XRP Ripple.

2605
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:48,640
Yeah.

2606
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:49,640
Just use Ripple.

2607
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,640
With crypto, everything's possible.

2608
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,640
Oh my god.

2609
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,640
Blockchain technology.

2610
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:57,640
Okay.

2611
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:59,640
Next one is called...

2612
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:03,640
Is it update on an old friend from an old friend?

2613
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:04,640
That's the next one, right?

2614
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,640
Yep.

2615
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:06,640
Yeah, okay.

2616
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,640
3, 2, 1, go.

2617
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,640
Oh, the new Davoo video.

2618
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:21,640
Yeah, Davoo put out a new video.

2619
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,640
Did you see that?

2620
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,640
Oh, I did.

2621
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,640
I did.

2622
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:27,640
Good for her.

2623
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:28,640
Good for her.

2624
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:34,640
But I'm extremely jealous of how good her voice is,

2625
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:35,640
and I couldn't watch it.

2626
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:36,640
I felt bad.

2627
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,640
Oh, really?

2628
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:38,640
Made me feel bad.

2629
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:39,640
But it's not her fault.

2630
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:40,640
It's no hate.

2631
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:42,640
I was just like, oh god, no.

2632
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,640
She sure does sound different.

2633
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:46,640
It's true.

2634
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:47,640
Completely different.

2635
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:51,640
Although she talks really slowly in that video?

2636
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,640
Or now maybe she just talks really slow now?

2637
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:58,640
There was a part that made me roll my eyes where she claims like,

2638
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:01,640
yeah, before talking in my old voice,

2639
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:04,640
it always made me feel like physical pain.

2640
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:08,640
And then I realized that it was because my voice was too deep.

2641
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,640
Shut up.

2642
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:11,640
No, it didn't.

2643
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,640
No, it didn't.

2644
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:22,640
There's a certain aspect of transitioning where once you feel gender euphoria,

2645
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:25,640
because you've never felt it before,

2646
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:30,640
you suddenly realize how much you didn't like everything previously.

2647
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:34,640
You had a general level of unhappiness going on,

2648
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:37,640
and it's invisible to you because that's all you've ever known.

2649
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:41,640
I can imagine that it feels like that way,

2650
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:47,640
but it is maybe a little over the top to say physical pain.

2651
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:48,640
You know what?

2652
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:49,640
I'm paraphrasing.

2653
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,640
She said something like it...

2654
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:56,640
I think she said it caused her pain or something like,

2655
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:58,640
yeah, whatever.

2656
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:01,640
I'll buy it.

2657
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:05,640
I felt similar things to similar stuff.

2658
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:07,640
I was surprised.

2659
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,640
She talked really slow.

2660
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:11,640
At least threw a lot of it.

2661
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,640
I think that video...

2662
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,640
You know, it's a video about Fival American Tale, I guess.

2663
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:20,640
It sort of claims to be a review.

2664
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:22,640
It's not a review at all.

2665
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:27,640
It's basically just like some light commentary about some things in the game.

2666
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:34,640
I'm pretty sure that it's basically just like a soft, sort of coming out video, basically,

2667
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:36,640
but doesn't call itself that.

2668
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:38,640
The purpose of the video is to come out,

2669
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:40,640
hey guys, I'm trans now,

2670
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:44,640
but it's not calling itself that.

2671
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,640
No, it's a video about Fival.

2672
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:50,640
But in it, I will take a brief aside to be like,

2673
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:54,640
yeah, I transition, this is my new voice, blah blah blah blah, whatever,

2674
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:58,640
which is fine, which is fine.

2675
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,640
I should probably just message her to ask how,

2676
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:04,640
like what she did to train it,

2677
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:06,640
just because I don't know.

2678
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:07,640
Perhaps.

2679
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:10,640
I would like knowledge about that.

2680
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:12,640
That's fair.

2681
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:16,640
That would be a reasonable thing to do if you want to know about that, I guess.

2682
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:18,640
I don't know.

2683
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,640
What can I say?

2684
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:26,640
Davoo, I guess I'll get into it.

2685
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:31,640
Davoo messaged me before putting that video out,

2686
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:35,640
like a few days before, maybe a week before or something,

2687
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:37,640
and said like,

2688
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:39,640
Ben, I'm thinking about,

2689
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:41,640
I'm thinking that maybe I might,

2690
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,640
you know, sort of come back to the internet a little bit.

2691
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:47,640
Like I made a Discord server and everything,

2692
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:49,640
and I'm like, okay.

2693
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:51,640
And she said like,

2694
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:54,640
but I wanted to tell you that,

2695
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:58,640
I actually just want you to know,

2696
02:16:58,640 --> 02:17:00,640
so you're not surprised,

2697
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:04,640
that I don't agree with what you were doing

2698
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:08,640
with the paying people to unpledge from Trixie's Patreon.

2699
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:11,640
So I just want you to know that I don't think that,

2700
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:15,640
I'm not for that, I don't think that's right or whatever.

2701
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:17,640
And I just like,

2702
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,640
I don't know, shut the fuck up.

2703
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:21,640
Shut the fuck up, go away.

2704
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:23,640
Piss off, I don't fucking care.

2705
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:25,640
You idiot, you fucking moron.

2706
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:27,640
You're a fucking rube.

2707
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:31,640
Davoo messaged me all the time to tell me about how much,

2708
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:33,640
how bad Trixie was to her,

2709
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,640
and how much she mistreated her and stuff.

2710
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,640
And then I'd be like,

2711
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:40,640
well you should say something about it,

2712
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:42,640
and she'd say no,

2713
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:44,640
no I can't,

2714
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:46,640
because what if something bad happens,

2715
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:48,640
what if somebody got mad at me,

2716
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:50,640
I can't say anything about it,

2717
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,640
but you should keep saying it though.

2718
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,640
I like what you're saying,

2719
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:56,640
but I'm not going to say anything.

2720
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,640
But actually, I don't agree with,

2721
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,640
you shouldn't mess with someone's income, Ben.

2722
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:03,640
It's wrong to mess with someone's income,

2723
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:06,640
even if they abuse me or whatever,

2724
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,640
whatever I said, I don't remember.

2725
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:11,640
That's too far, that's too far, I don't agree with that.

2726
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:13,640
Shut the fuck up.

2727
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,640
I hate Davoo, fuck Davoo.

2728
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:17,640
That's my statement about that.

2729
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,640
The end.

2730
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:23,640
Any thoughts?

2731
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:28,640
Incredibly transphobic Ben saying that again.

2732
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:31,640
True, true.

2733
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:33,640
What can I say?

2734
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:39,640
I'm just, I'm the product of my society.

2735
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,640
Alright.

2736
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,640
That's all I have to say about Davoo's new video.

2737
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:46,640
Next one is called,

2738
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:48,640
VVV Saber Dub, please?

2739
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,640
Maybe.

2740
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:52,640
Three, two, one, go.

2741
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:56,640
Hello again, Benjamin St.

2742
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,640
Hello.

2743
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:00,640
SaberSpark64 has released yet another video,

2744
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:05,640
reviewing Halo Infinite, it looks like.

2745
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:06,640
Okay.

2746
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:13,640
Would you mind telling me if it's narrated by Tom or Saber?

2747
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:15,640
Why would you ask this?

2748
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:18,640
I don't, I still.

2749
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:21,640
Don't even want to click it, don't want to chance it.

2750
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:25,640
Still went on the dub of that one video,

2751
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:30,640
but like, I'm still going to listen to the ones that are like,

2752
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:32,640
primarily with Tom.

2753
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:33,640
That's all.

2754
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:35,640
I'm confused.

2755
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:37,640
What, what dub is he talking about?

2756
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:41,640
I think he left another voicemail a while ago,

2757
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:48,640
asking you to please dub over or have Tom dub over at SaberSpark 64 video

2758
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:52,640
where SaberSpark was speaking, cause he didn't like hearing SaberSpark.

2759
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,640
Right.

2760
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,640
I also don't like SaberSpark's voice.

2761
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:58,640
I don't like the way he talks in his videos.

2762
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,640
It's a common affliction with YouTubers.

2763
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,640
He's one of them.

2764
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:06,640
Yeah, man.

2765
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:08,640
I'll get right on that.

2766
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:12,640
Right after I, right after I get the HTML board of the game.

2767
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:14,640
You should do dubs of all the SaberSpark videos.

2768
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:19,640
Yeah, just start a new channel.

2769
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,640
I'll start a new channel.

2770
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:23,640
It's called, it's called SaberSpark 64 dubs.

2771
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:28,640
And it's, I just re-upload every SaberSpark 64 video with my voice.

2772
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:33,640
And then I make a fucking blu-ray about it.

2773
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:37,640
Oh, if you're so, if you, if you like it so much, why did you make a fucking blu-ray about it?

2774
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:39,640
Uh, I guess I will.

2775
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:41,640
I can do that now.

2776
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:45,640
Now that, now there's how you gain clout.

2777
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:48,640
Now there's a move to get, to blow up on social-

2778
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,640
The blu-ray guy.

2779
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,640
Oh, blue saint.

2780
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:56,640
Now there's a drip feed for your social media engagement, whatever.

2781
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:03,640
Um, next voicemail is called Rod Serling, Life Without Enemies.

2782
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:08,640
Three, two, one, go.

2783
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,640
Imagine if you will, a world in which tricks of the golden bitch had never existed.

2784
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:17,640
Ben Sainz is on this cathedral throne, lethargic.

2785
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:22,640
He opens up Twitter on his phone, but who is there to even talk shit on for the third time this week?

2786
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:32,640
He fancies that he should do something productive, but wears the grievance that nemesis from whom to draw the motivation of pure spite which sets him about his projects.

2787
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,640
When is Radcom five?

2788
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:39,640
What is even the point when there is no subject for jokes about deleting one of the lecture recordings?

2789
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:44,640
Finally, our saint decides to try and get himself some bitches on Tinder.

2790
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,640
He cannot.

2791
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,640
The connection he makes remains an entirely shadow.

2792
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:54,640
He finds himself to his despair, unable to even remember love.

2793
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:59,640
So to everyone with an anime, you'd better treasure that golden bitch,

2794
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:04,640
for without villains, no revenge, not even a phantoms, soon available on itch.

2795
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:06,640
Oh, nice.

2796
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,640
Hey, that was great.

2797
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,640
I liked that a lot.

2798
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,640
And it's true.

2799
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:18,640
I like the idea that if, like, Trixie existing means you get bitches on Tinder.

2800
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:21,640
Yeah, if only Trixie had not existed.

2801
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:24,640
Okay, it's the bad timeline.

2802
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:26,640
It's the bad timeline.

2803
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:30,640
Wait, oh wait, no, in real light, yeah.

2804
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:38,640
Because in this alternate timeline, no Trixie, no Blu-rays, no Radcon, no bitches.

2805
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:41,640
Yeah, it's true.

2806
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:46,640
It's the worst possible future.

2807
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:54,640
Good thing Trixie is all too real, and the bitches all too plentiful.

2808
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:59,640
Very, very good.

2809
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:01,640
I have nothing to add.

2810
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,640
You nailed it.

2811
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:06,640
Okay, next one is called, next one is X3.

2812
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,640
Three, two, one, go.

2813
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:13,640
He is almost here.

2814
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:15,640
Oh, development.

2815
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:17,640
Oh, almost.

2816
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:19,640
This is just Lord English.

2817
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:21,640
Something's happening.

2818
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:30,640
Next one is called, it's a minute long, and it looks like it's a real question.

2819
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:33,640
It's called Christian YouTube Censorship.

2820
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:36,640
Three, two, one, go.

2821
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:38,640
What's up, PCP?

2822
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:41,640
Dusty Dumps slash The Wall Guy here.

2823
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,640
Yes.

2824
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:46,640
Last week, I sent a, PCP presents The Wall.

2825
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:48,640
I saw you commented on the last one.

2826
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:55,640
But I realized that the lyrics were pretty hard to discern as I was going through COVID at the time.

2827
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:57,640
I mean, I still am kind of.

2828
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:58,640
Oh, bummer.

2829
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:02,640
I was like, okay, I'll just post the lyrics in the comments.

2830
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:03,640
That'll be great.

2831
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:05,640
People can sing along at home.

2832
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:07,640
It'll be a good time for everyone.

2833
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:14,640
But whenever I would post the lyrics, they would, the comment would be automatically deleted.

2834
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,640
So I was like, what's the deal?

2835
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:22,640
So I tried experimenting on a bunch of different videos, commenting different things.

2836
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:30,640
It seems to me that YouTube now automatically just like auto-deletes a comment with swearing in it.

2837
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:33,640
And not just swearing, even like illusions to swearing.

2838
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,640
Even if you like try to.

2839
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,640
Use like an asterisk.

2840
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:42,640
Like censor it or put in some sort of like censor marks or just like take out the word.

2841
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:46,640
YouTube just like automatically detects, oh, you're trying to swear here, boy.

2842
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,640
And deletes your comments.

2843
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,640
Did you know about this?

2844
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,640
What's the deal with that?

2845
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:58,640
I mean, I've seen comments disappear seemingly randomly.

2846
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:01,640
So I mean, it doesn't surprise me that much.

2847
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:07,640
I mean, I guess it's hard to notice when comments have not been showing up.

2848
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:10,640
Because you don't know that they should be there.

2849
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,640
I mean, I feel like they've seen swears though.

2850
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:17,640
There are definitely swears in comments.

2851
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,640
I think unless something changed and I haven't been paying attention.

2852
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:24,640
Could it be like your account settings, maybe?

2853
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,640
Could it be just like a you thing?

2854
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:27,640
I don't know.

2855
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:29,640
It could be blacklisted.

2856
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:30,640
Maybe.

2857
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:31,640
Maybe.

2858
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:35,640
It's definitely a thing YouTube has the power to do is to know your user, your Google account.

2859
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:37,640
Say, oh, that person.

2860
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,640
Like, why?

2861
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:40,640
I don't know.

2862
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:43,640
No, nobody knows.

2863
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:46,640
God, I hope you figure out how to swear in the comments.

2864
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:49,640
Everybody in the comments say a swear word.

2865
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:50,640
Cuss in the comments.

2866
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:51,640
Let's figure this out.

2867
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:54,640
Just say the most vile shit down there, please.

2868
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:57,640
And thank you.

2869
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:04,640
OK, next one is called Fucking with Trixie 3 from PJWorthman at Hotmail.com.

2870
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:07,640
Three, two, one, go.

2871
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:08,640
All right, Ben.

2872
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:11,640
So you got the book, Road to Radcon Finish.

2873
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:14,640
You got the plebe and the weed, blue rays, out.

2874
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:17,640
There's still one more thing you can do to fuck with Trixie.

2875
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:19,640
Is it Cus Omega?

2876
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:21,640
You got to do the Brony Lecture.

2877
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:31,640
I mean, it can even be the Brony Lecture Lecture where you just talk about all the dumb bullshit that surrounded it and why this dumb video about ponies never came out.

2878
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,640
I think it could be fun.

2879
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,640
One last way to fucking get at them.

2880
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:39,640
And then every Radcon obligation is finished.

2881
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:41,640
Pretty cool.

2882
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:47,640
Also, is there a way I can get the plebe and the weed, blue ray and the Radcon book together as a bundle?

2883
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:49,640
Shipping to Canada isn't cheap.

2884
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:54,640
PCP forever, Tom will never die, call me back.

2885
02:26:54,640 --> 02:27:06,640
I think I might have said this before, but yeah, if we ever did some sort of Radcon 5 or equivalent, I probably would do a Brony Lecture Lecture.

2886
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:09,640
It probably wouldn't be very long, but it would be pretty funny.

2887
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:11,640
Yeah, I probably would do something like that.

2888
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:16,640
It's a very funny idea.

2889
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:21,640
No, you can't buy them as a bundle because they have to go in separate envelopes.

2890
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:23,640
I have to ship them separately.

2891
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,640
I'm sorry.

2892
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:29,640
I know international shipping, especially on the blue ray, is kind of shit, but I'm sorry.

2893
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:36,640
They charge me $15 to send a fucking DVD box anywhere outside of the United States.

2894
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,640
Wait, are they not flat enough?

2895
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:43,640
They are not thin enough to be considered envelopes.

2896
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:44,640
They are too thick.

2897
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,640
They are considered packages.

2898
02:27:46,640 --> 02:28:01,640
It varies, but it costs between $13 up to $19 to send it depending on the country, which is a bit lame, but I don't know.

2899
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:04,640
That's what they make me do.

2900
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:11,640
Inside of the US, it's not so bad because they have a program called Media Mail, which is basically just...

2901
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:24,640
If your mail is just books or recorded video content or a small list of things like that, you could just mail it cheaper.

2902
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:30,640
They just will give you a discount on mailing, but it doesn't extend internationally, so I have to...

2903
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:31,640
Sorry about that.

2904
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,640
I'm sorry.

2905
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:38,640
There is no bulk discount for the plebe and the weeb and the Road to Radcon.

2906
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:47,640
However, if you are a patron, you do get $5 off of the Road to Radcon.

2907
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:53,640
And of course, if you backed the plebe and weeb Kickstarter and you show me a screenshot of your pledge at the $40 tier or higher,

2908
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:58,640
I will give you $20 off that.

2909
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:01,640
If you didn't, you're fucked.

2910
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:04,640
Sorry.

2911
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,640
Anyway, yes, good voicemail.

2912
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:07,640
Next one.

2913
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:10,640
ASMR, I said it wrong and I'm not re-recording.

2914
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,640
My break is over.

2915
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:16,640
Three, two, one, go.

2916
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:24,640
Can I request a view of a longer-form video?

2917
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:29,640
I'm working 12 hours every day.

2918
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:33,640
Sorry, this is a mere two-hour, 30-minute podcast.

2919
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:39,640
12 hours of an AMSR friend simulator.

2920
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:41,640
No, fuck you.

2921
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,640
You're no friend of mine.

2922
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:45,640
I said, yeah, buddy.

2923
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:47,640
Going forward, we're getting through this.

2924
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:49,640
You won me.

2925
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:51,640
Yeah.

2926
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,640
I need something to get me through this.

2927
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,640
Yeah, well.

2928
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,640
Oh, you sound haggard.

2929
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,640
You sound destroyed, defeated.

2930
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:02,640
Boy, damn, you really could use a friend, huh?

2931
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:04,640
Well, oh well.

2932
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:07,640
Next voicemail.

2933
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:09,640
No, here's what you do.

2934
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:18,640
You play the procrastination podcast like normal and you turn the speed to 0.5 and then it takes longer.

2935
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:27,640
Listen, Mr. ASMR, as Trixie famously said, I don't have to listen to you just because you give me money, all right?

2936
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:29,640
So fuck you.

2937
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:33,640
I'm assuming you're a patron since you want to be our friend so bad.

2938
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:44,640
Best way to become our real-life best friend would be to draw $5 in the Patreon, in my opinion.

2939
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:50,640
It's the first step of a 1,000-mile journey.

2940
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:54,640
Next voicemail is called Kyle and Funny Man.

2941
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:58,640
The Space from TheSpaceEpic at PewPew.com.

2942
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,640
Three, two, one, go.

2943
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:04,640
One name's Kyle, the other is a Funny Man.

2944
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:07,640
It's Kyle and Funny Man in Space.

2945
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:10,640
Yeah, that's right. This voicemail storyline was no joke.

2946
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:13,640
This is literally going to go for 18 episodes.

2947
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,640
Yeah, continuity.

2948
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:17,640
Now it'll be like an epic five-minute one,

2949
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:20,640
paying off all the storylines and all the epic lore and stuff.

2950
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,640
I hope so, or else what was the point?

2951
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:23,640
Stop in.

2952
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:24,640
Don't waste my time.

2953
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:25,640
Get ready.

2954
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,640
I'm ready.

2955
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:29,640
Hey, Funny Man.

2956
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,640
I don't watch movies, but I listen to these voicemails.

2957
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:37,640
I really got to use the toilet because I get some real nasty space stew.

2958
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,640
Taco Bell? Okay.

2959
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:40,640
Okay.

2960
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:41,640
Yep.

2961
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:42,640
It'll do it.

2962
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:45,640
It might take a bit longer still.

2963
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:47,640
Why is that funny, man?

2964
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:52,640
Are you having some diarrhea in there?

2965
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:55,640
No, it's actually quite the opposite.

2966
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:59,640
I'm having dry dubs.

2967
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:00,640
Good for him.

2968
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:01,640
Oh my God, Funny Man.

2969
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,640
Good for him.

2970
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:04,640
You would have referenced that.

2971
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:05,640
Oh my God.

2972
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,640
That's it.

2973
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:08,640
I'm showing it for life here on the space station.

2974
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:09,640
This is good.

2975
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:10,640
This is great stuff.

2976
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:12,640
The audience at home, literally probably when I said that,

2977
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,640
because that's the thing that people in the PCP,

2978
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,640
the audience remembers.

2979
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:17,640
And we're going to go for...

2980
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:19,640
Remembers from like two weeks ago.

2981
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:22,640
And oh my God, I get so excited for the future because oh my God,

2982
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:25,640
we're going to go into the funny fucking adventures.

2983
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:27,640
Oh, this is so fucking good.

2984
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:30,640
This is the beginning of a beautiful arc, I think.

2985
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:34,640
This is on the road to like Voice Grail.

2986
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:36,640
It's getting there.

2987
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:38,640
All it needs, I would say at this point,

2988
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:41,640
all it needs is a like 15 minute long,

2989
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:47,640
like fully musical finale.

2990
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,640
Like you're there.

2991
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,640
Like you're there.

2992
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:51,640
You just got to bring it home.

2993
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:54,640
You've built up the bond with the audience.

2994
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:57,640
You just got to stick the landing.

2995
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:59,640
And we'll have a classic on our hand.

2996
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:02,640
You got an intro song.

2997
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:06,640
You got a guy thoroughly explaining the point of the thing immediately.

2998
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:07,640
It's all the ingredients.

2999
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:10,640
Front loading before the actual show begins.

3000
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,640
All the ingredients.

3001
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:14,640
So people are all like on the same page.

3002
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:17,640
All the ingredients of greatness.

3003
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:20,640
Next voicemail is called Endless Wordle.

3004
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,640
Three, two, one, go.

3005
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:26,640
Day five in Wordle office, RFCK.

3006
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:29,640
I can't see anything.

3007
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:31,640
I'm looking for the updates.

3008
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:34,640
I'm looking for what's being updated on the game.

3009
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:37,640
I'm looking for if there's possible bugs I have to take account of.

3010
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:39,640
I can't see anything.

3011
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,640
I can't fucking see anything.

3012
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:45,640
I have to scroll through 100,000 fucking moon runes of little baby blocks

3013
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:49,640
being built up from the top down down to a fucking pyramid.

3014
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:51,640
And I can't fucking understand anything.

3015
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:55,640
And then I find out that they're not even fucking playing the game.

3016
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:58,640
They're not even playing Wordle by posting that.

3017
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:01,640
They're just updating each other on their fucking progress.

3018
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:03,640
It's...

3019
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:07,640
Wait.

3020
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:09,640
Does this guy not understand Wordle?

3021
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:12,640
Has he just seen the tweets and not thought to Google it?

3022
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:16,640
I guess this is an Endless War dev and like Endless War...

3023
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,640
Is Endless War being flooded with Wordle squares?

3024
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:20,640
Perhaps.

3025
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,640
That would be funny.

3026
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:24,640
I would support that.

3027
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:28,640
The Endless War kids gotta get a fucking education.

3028
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:30,640
They need to learn to spell.

3029
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:33,640
About time.

3030
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:36,640
Next one is Tony.

3031
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:37,640
It's Tony.

3032
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:39,640
Three, two, one, go.

3033
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:41,640
Hey, this is Tony.

3034
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:44,640
So the last voicemail message I sent,

3035
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:50,640
I was talking about how I always skip the voicemail messages being read in the podcast.

3036
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:55,640
So I've never heard my own voicemails being read.

3037
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:58,640
And I would like to, but I don't know how to solve this problem.

3038
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:01,640
Because I don't know what episodes I...

3039
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:04,640
My messages are in and I don't know what the timestamp is.

3040
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:06,640
So I guess I'm just kind of fucked.

3041
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:08,640
Yeah.

3042
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,640
That's all.

3043
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:10,640
Well...

3044
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:12,640
Episode 2...

3045
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:13,640
Wait, what is this?

3046
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,640
Is this 291?

3047
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,640
Gib?

3048
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:17,640
Okay.

3049
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:18,640
She's muted.

3050
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,640
Whatever.

3051
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:21,640
I think this is episode 291.

3052
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:22,640
Whatever.

3053
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:23,640
Episode 291.

3054
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:24,640
Gotcha, buddy.

3055
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:26,640
You're in there.

3056
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:29,640
No problem.

3057
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:32,640
Alright.

3058
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:33,640
Next one...

3059
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,640
I'm just gonna continue.

3060
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,640
I'm just gonna go ahead.

3061
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:44,640
So this one is a Google Drive link from Solaru, I think?

3062
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:46,640
It didn't work.

3063
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:49,640
The copy-paste didn't work.

3064
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:53,640
Did I have to leave the underscore off the end?

3065
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:58,640
Unfortunately, I'm getting a...

3066
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:01,640
Sorry, the file you have requested does not exist.

3067
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:04,640
I am sorry.

3068
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:06,640
Well, if this is from Solaru...

3069
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:07,640
Oh no, I'm bad at this.

3070
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:08,640
At home sick.

3071
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:09,640
Well, you are bad at it.

3072
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:10,640
I'm sorry, the link didn't work.

3073
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:11,640
I'm sorry.

3074
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:13,640
Try again, maybe.

3075
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:14,640
Alright.

3076
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,640
Gib said BRB and I...

3077
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:18,640
The next one is for her, I think?

3078
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:19,640
So I'm just gonna...

3079
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:22,640
I will just hit the bathroom for a second.

3080
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,640
You know what?

3081
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:24,640
I don't even have to say this.

3082
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:25,640
Just cut this out.

3083
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:26,640
We'll just take a pause.

3084
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:27,640
LA's are.

3085
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:28,640
Just cut this part out.

3086
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:31,640
I'm just gonna go and I'll be back in a minute.

3087
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:32,640
And maybe Gib will be back.

3088
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,640
And this is not for anyone.

3089
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,640
This is not for the audience to hear.

3090
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:38,640
This is secret.

3091
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:39,640
Alright.

3092
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,640
It was just in time to see you unmute.

3093
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,640
Okay, good.

3094
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:48,640
Sorry, it was a matter of fecal urgency.

3095
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:49,640
Okay.

3096
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:54,640
I suddenly needed to shit and I had no time to explain.

3097
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,640
Acceptable.

3098
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,640
Acceptable reason.

3099
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:01,640
Okay, well the next one was a Google Drive link, but it didn't work.

3100
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:04,640
I couldn't get the link to work, unfortunately.

3101
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:06,640
Uh, Google...

3102
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:11,640
Wait, there are two dashes in the middle of that.

3103
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:13,640
Are they supposed to be there?

3104
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:15,640
Are they not supposed to?

3105
02:37:15,640 --> 02:37:18,640
I don't think dashes exist in files.

3106
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,640
Oh no, I got rid of them.

3107
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:20,640
It still doesn't work.

3108
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:25,640
Yeah, I tried getting rid of the underscore at the end and that also didn't help.

3109
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:29,640
Sorry, that's too bad.

3110
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:33,640
But anyway, the next one seems like it's for you.

3111
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:38,640
It's an image from Giant Gazongas Gib at Girl Gamer.

3112
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,640
Oh, base.

3113
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:44,640
Alright, here we go.

3114
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:47,640
Whoa, this is like cool.

3115
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:49,640
It's like a real drawing.

3116
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:51,640
It's like a real drawing.

3117
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:52,640
Wait, what is this?

3118
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:58,640
Actually, me taking my entire online career was a bit, a ruse, a Kafka-esque,

3119
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:00,640
meta-allegorical critique on houses.

3120
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,640
Is that supposed to be Trixie?

3121
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:04,640
That, I think, is supposed to be Trixie.

3122
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:09,640
It's a very flattering portrayal of her hair in particular.

3123
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:14,640
And the People's Choice Podcast Award for the funniest joke goes to Miss Bonte.

3124
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:16,640
Miss Bonte.

3125
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:20,640
For the iconic line, you give them an inch, they'll take my splinge.

3126
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:26,640
Who could forget?

3127
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:30,640
Oh, it's iconic only because it was a tag.

3128
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:33,640
It's such a nothing coming out of it.

3129
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:40,640
Total afterthought, but now it's our tagline.

3130
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,640
Now it's the title of this episode.

3131
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,640
Maybe not, actually.

3132
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:49,640
It's not very Google-friendly.

3133
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:50,640
This is really nice.

3134
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,640
Look at those Pozongas.

3135
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:55,640
I'm looking respectfully.

3136
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:03,640
Is that the People's Choice Podcast Award for funniest joke?

3137
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,640
Is that Bill Clinton?

3138
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:05,640
I don't know who that is.

3139
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:07,640
I think it's just a guy.

3140
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:09,640
I'm not sure who it's supposed to be.

3141
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:11,640
This is a really nice drawing.

3142
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:13,640
I'm going to save that to the fan art folder.

3143
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:15,640
This is great, yeah.

3144
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:19,640
Actually, me and me tanking my entire online career was a bit a ruse.

3145
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:21,640
A Kafka-esque meta-allegorical...

3146
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:25,640
She doesn't know what Kafka-esque is.

3147
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:27,640
I don't...

3148
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:30,640
I'm trying to think if I've ever heard her use the freight.

3149
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,640
Probably, I don't know.

3150
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:36,640
She's probably heard people say it.

3151
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:40,640
I'm sure she's never read any Kafka.

3152
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,640
I read one Kafka.

3153
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:45,640
I read Metamorphosis when I was like 13.

3154
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,640
Maybe even younger.

3155
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:50,640
My dad got me to read it for some fucked up reason.

3156
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:53,640
I'm going to get anything out of that when I'm a fucking kid.

3157
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:56,640
Give me a break.

3158
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:57,640
Anyway...

3159
02:39:57,640 --> 02:40:00,640
Pozongas Gib Girl Gamer.

3160
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:02,640
Naming the file.

3161
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:03,640
This is great.

3162
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:04,640
This is great.

3163
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,640
Thank you.

3164
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:08,640
I think we've just got one more...

3165
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:09,640
Yeah.

3166
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:14,640
Just one more image from Pick at COVID Daredevil.

3167
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:18,640
Sure.

3168
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:19,640
Oh.

3169
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:27,640
COVID Daredevil versus the Thousand Lung Man.

3170
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:28,640
When...

3171
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:32,640
I don't remember the COVID Daredevil.

3172
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:33,640
I also...

3173
02:40:33,640 --> 02:40:35,640
Was that a thing when I wasn't there?

3174
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:36,640
I'll be honest.

3175
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:37,640
I'll be honest.

3176
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:38,640
It doesn't ring a bell.

3177
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:41,640
But just because I don't remember something doesn't mean anything.

3178
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:46,640
I do remember a joke involving like COVID not actually being bad.

3179
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:47,640
In fact, it gives you super...

3180
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:48,640
No, I do remember.

3181
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:49,640
Oh, yes.

3182
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:50,640
The COVID Daredevil.

3183
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:51,640
Right.

3184
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:54,640
It makes you lose your sense of smell and taste, but it boosts your other senses.

3185
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:55,640
Right.

3186
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:56,640
Yes.

3187
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:59,640
But I think the COVID Daredevil was also blind for unrelated reasons.

3188
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,640
Yes.

3189
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,640
She just happened to also be blind.

3190
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:05,640
And she's a big titty lady.

3191
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:06,640
And guess why not?

3192
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:07,640
I get...

3193
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:08,640
Yeah.

3194
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:09,640
I'm sure.

3195
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:10,640
Thousand Lung Man.

3196
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:11,640
So wait.

3197
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:12,640
Is this implying...

3198
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:13,640
Is that a vaccine?

3199
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:14,640
Or is it like...

3200
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,640
I believe...

3201
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:18,640
The Daredevil is using COVID to defeat the person with loads of lungs.

3202
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:19,640
Yeah.

3203
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:22,640
It says Omega variant, so it's not the vaccine.

3204
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,640
It's COVID.

3205
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:26,640
The COVID Daredevil.

3206
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:32,640
Because, I mean, she has COVID, right?

3207
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:33,640
And it's good.

3208
02:41:33,640 --> 02:41:35,640
It's the source of her power.

3209
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:38,640
Her inability to smell things.

3210
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:40,640
If her sense of smell were to...

3211
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:44,640
If she were to not have COVID and her sense of smell and taste were to return.

3212
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:46,640
If that part of her brain were to grow back.

3213
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:51,640
I mean, her other power, her many other powers would just dissipate.

3214
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:58,640
In the middle of battle, she would find herself unable to compete in the free market.

3215
02:41:58,640 --> 02:41:59,640
I don't know.

3216
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:02,640
These lungs are disgusting.

3217
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:14,640
They look like the funny chins on that King Goblin or King Troll in the Hobbit movie.

3218
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:18,640
I didn't see any of the Hobbit movies.

3219
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:19,640
There's like a...

3220
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:26,640
The Goblin King, and he's got like a big nut sack, ball sack chin that's flabby and gross.

3221
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:27,640
Hobbit?

3222
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:29,640
Oh, I gotta see this.

3223
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:31,640
I'm sold.

3224
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:33,640
Is he the Great Goblin?

3225
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:35,640
I forget his name.

3226
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:37,640
He's like a king of something.

3227
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:42,640
Yeah, he's just got a big sagging jowl chin.

3228
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:44,640
Well, that's gross.

3229
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:46,640
Good for him.

3230
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:47,640
Good for him.

3231
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,640
At least he doesn't have COVID.

3232
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:53,640
But at least he can smell, idiot.

3233
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:55,640
Yeah.

3234
02:42:55,640 --> 02:42:59,640
We did it.

3235
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:00,640
That's it.

3236
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:07,640
I want to quickly clarify because I feel bad for accidentally saying the image that I looked at was like,

3237
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:09,640
oh, it's like a real drawing.

3238
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,640
It's not to say that other drawings are not real drawings.

3239
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:17,640
It's just like clearly like a higher level of like artistic skill, you know?

3240
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:18,640
Oh, I don't want to clarify.

3241
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:19,640
I want to clarify.

3242
02:43:19,640 --> 02:43:21,640
Like I didn't mean that the other ones aren't drawings.

3243
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:24,640
I just mean that this one was good and those ones were bad.

3244
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:28,640
This one was like markedly gooder.

3245
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,640
It does.

3246
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:30,640
It does have anatomy.

3247
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:31,640
It's definitely got anatomy.

3248
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:32,640
Yes.

3249
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,640
It's got anatomy.

3250
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:36,640
When you're drawing big bazongas, there's only two ways you can go.

3251
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:41,640
Anatomy or large circle, very big.

3252
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,640
Large circle, comma, very big.

3253
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:57,640
That's, you know, wait, wait, did you know that Ernest Hemingway was once challenged to write the saddest story in the world?

3254
02:43:57,640 --> 02:43:59,640
In only four words?

3255
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:02,640
And he wrote large circle, very big.

3256
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:03,640
No.

3257
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:07,640
That's not a sad story.

3258
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:08,640
I like that story.

3259
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:09,640
Oh, yeah.

3260
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:10,640
Yeah, he failed.

3261
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,640
He failed the challenge.

3262
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:12,640
He lost.

3263
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:17,640
The most erotic story, large circle.

3264
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:20,640
Large circle, very big.

3265
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:21,640
Excellent.

3266
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:22,640
All right.

3267
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:24,640
We have, we have done it.

3268
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:29,640
We have, we have recorded it despite, despite everything.

3269
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:33,640
We have recorded another podcast this week.

3270
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:34,640
Despite everything.

3271
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:35,640
It's still the PCP.

3272
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:36,640
It's true.

3273
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:37,640
It's true.

3274
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:38,640
It's true.

3275
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:39,640
It's true.

3276
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:40,640
It's truer now than ever before.

3277
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:43,640
We're in fact more the PCP than we ever were.

3278
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:47,640
Heck, I got nothing else to say.

3279
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:48,640
I'm done.

3280
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:49,640
I'll see.

3281
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:51,640
I'll see you all next week.

3282
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:52,640
Yeah.

3283
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:53,640
Yeah.

3284
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:57,640
Have a good week, you fools.

3285
02:44:57,640 --> 02:44:58,640
Have a good one.

3286
02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:00,640
Don't get, don't get Omicron.

3287
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:01,640
Don't get COVID.

3288
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:02,640
Don't get COVID.

3289
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:08,640
And if you do, hope it gives you benefits, boosts to your other senses.

3290
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:09,640
Of course.

3291
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:10,640
Yeah.

3292
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:11,640
Don't, don't get COVID.

3293
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:12,640
But if you do, buy the shirt.

3294
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:15,640
Yes, definitely.

3295
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:18,640
Buy a fucking, buy the Bane mask, buy the Bane mask.

3296
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:22,640
I expect it's going to do great things for me.

3297
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:23,640
Hell yeah.

3298
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:24,640
Okay.

3299
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:25,640
That's it.

3300
02:45:25,640 --> 02:45:26,640
Peace out.

3301
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:27,640
Nice.

3302
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,640
Nice.

3303
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:30,640
Thanks for listening.

3304
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:31,640
Bye.

3305
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:32,640
Bye.
