00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back again this week to talk about a new topic.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm your host, Guy, the best guy ever, your anime man extraordinaire, talking about all the hypest, kawaii shit that you need to have in your life.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I'm here with my internet people once again. Let's go down the line. Ben, who are you?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ben Saint, SaintComics.com. I'm a mangomancer.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't forget that Patreon link. That's what the people want to hear about.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No man, I'm playing it close to the chest this week. I'm keeping it cool.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Listen to this guy. Alright, Digi.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I stay hype! I stay hype!

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There you go. Jesse Wood.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm Endless Jess. I review cartoons every week, but I forgot to this week.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ashy as fuck. Gibb, Hippocrit.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm Hippocrit, and I'm taking a shit.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the Davoo.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I edit Digi Bro videos, or make my own videos. It depends on what gets the most patronage.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There you go. And we're back this week to talk about Hippocrit.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think this is going to be the best podcast we've ever had, ever recorded ever.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, I think that's crazy.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It might just change the entire podcast landscape, rock the whole industry to its core.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right. There's no doubt about it.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, I get it. It's a joke.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's no joke. You can take that to the bank and make 1.1% interest dividends on that motherfucker.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You thought that was great. Just wait for the next ones.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know how you guys are thinking about doing this, but I think all I've been thinking about in preparation for this was just all the examples of hype

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that have ruined my life over the years, with a couple examples of things that have come out relatively okay.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because in general, and I think we'll probably all agree on this,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
hype is the worst thing ever.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is cancer.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It ruins my life all the time.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't like it. I don't like it.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, it's terrible.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It is.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There are occasional things that we can talk about when things actually live up to the hype,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and when you are hyped for something and it lives up to it, that's great.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But when it actually goes beyond your hype, that's when shit gets absolutely crazy.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And the most recent one that comes to mind for me is Undertale,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
because everything I expected with Undertale was achieved at the end of the pacifist run,

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and then when you get into the genocide stuff and all the stuff beyond that,

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it went shooting way beyond anything I thought it would do.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have a problem with people who say that Undertale was overhyped,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
because it wasn't hyped at all. There was nothing official.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All the hype was word of mouth.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There was the demo, and I was super excited for the demo,

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but yeah, everything became word of mouth after the game came out.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I mean, as someone who played the demo and then jumped on the game almost as soon as it came out,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
like for me, even I was hyped for it just because I love the demo.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, me too.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean, but now look at the internet.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now if your friends with anyone on the internet, they've told you you've got to play Undertale,

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but don't look up spoilers because it'll blow your mind.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, you can say that the fans have overhyped it,

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but I mean like when people blame the game for being overhyped,

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
when there was no marketing behind it whatsoever in the first place.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not like Watch Dogs where the hype was completely generated as a marketing thing beforehand.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's one very big distinction to make with hype,

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and that is a very specific kind of hype, which is pre-release hype,

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
which is mostly what we're going to talk about that week.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Corporate.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sure.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, we'll talk about both.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, I mean, look at something like...

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The actual hype that's good is like when you're actually having the thing that hype I love.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know about that all the time because something like...

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That kind of hype can be bad too.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, like a game like Final Fantasy VII or something,

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
if you want to play that now, there's no way you're going to go into that without bad news.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Everyone's got bad news now.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's take a step back.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's explain.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I want to explain hype before we get too deep into this.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, good idea.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's kind of what we do on this podcast.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Where's our Urban Dictionary, Nate?

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That was the one that you had one job.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I actually did.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I opened it, but the description was lackluster, so I didn't even buy it,

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but I'll read it to you right now.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I'll just do my own...

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll just define it myself.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So hype basically is when you're getting excited for something.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When something is generating a lot of attention and everyone's looking forward to it,

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
or in the aftermath of it, people are making it out to be something amazing.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So hype can't...

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can never be hype for something that you've seen.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hype is something that you either project to other people or receive from other people.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You almost verbatim quoted hype on Urban Dictionary,

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
which is when someone gets excited about something.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So good job.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But I think hype as an experience, once you've seen something and you think it's great,

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
you can hype it for other people, but I don't think that counts as you feeling hype.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're now creating hype.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hype is what people feel before they see it.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Other people hype something up for you, or you hype something up for other people,

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but once you've seen it, you can no longer just be hype for it.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me put forward a somewhat counterintuitive notion,

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
which is that I believe that all hype negatively impacts the experience

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and that generally the better you think something's going to be, the worse it actually is,

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
even if it's good.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There's something to that.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And that if you think something's bad, then it's going to be bad,

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
then it ends up being better, regardless.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And that hype is kind of like spoilers for overall quality in that if you're told something's good

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and that it ends up being good, it's like you've sort of been spoiled on its goodness already

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and it feels less significant.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know if I agree with that.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know what you mean.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I sort of agree there.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think there's a lot of overlap.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think that hype serves a purpose in that in order for you to go out of your way to seek out an experience,

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you need to have experienced a certain amount of hype for it.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But if you get too much of it, then it's going to, but the hype itself negatively impacts your experience.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I would say that I have had more things ruined for me with hype than by spoilers,

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
where oftentimes if I hear a spoiler for something I didn't even care about,

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it might get me interested because I'm like, whoa, that happens.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's kind of like, maybe there's a show that I thought looked dumb,

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but then I found out that one character dies and I'm like, oh, that's actually kind of cool.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then I watch it.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But when people hype something for me and they make it out like, oh man, you're going to love this.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My immediate thought going into it is I better love this.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Am I going to love this as much as that guy thinks I'm going to?

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's find out.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm really with Ben on that one.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In my bizarre, puritanical view of spoilers definitely crosses over into hype.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You need that little bit to get you to even play it in the first place,

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but I don't even want to know if something is good or bad or when good things happen.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How many times you play in a game next to someone and they're like, dude, next part is the best part.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Get fucking hype for it. You're going to love it. It's the worst. I want to kill that man.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's usually the fact that those people exist that they think hyping something up is a good idea.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dude, let me tell you.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The hype itself is just sort of like sometimes it can be good.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not that they think it's a good idea.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's that they want to do that to vicariously experience it through you as they can.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's for themselves.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let me tell you this little story about this guy I went to school with named Jarvis.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Jarvis? No, it was Jarvis.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This guy, he was in the anime club with me and he just loved.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, it was great. He just loved.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We always come up to be like, yo, guy, what are you watching right now?

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I'd be like, I don't know, Tsukuyomi or something.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We watched that one time and he was like, dude, that show is fucking great.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What episode do you want? I'm like, I don't know, episode three.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He was like, dude, episode four where, and he would describe the events that happen in that episode.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's like, get ready for it, dude, you're going to love it.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So not only did this guy spoil everything that happened in every,

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and he would insist on telling me these things every time.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I had to go out of my way to avoid him.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Like, this happened with every game, every show,

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
because this guy was an ultra-weeb.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He knew it all. He knew every single thing that I'd watched years before I'd seen it.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And just would insist.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It was this bizarre combination of trying to hype me and enjoying watching me be spoiled,

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
because I told him over and over, I didn't want to fucking know anything.

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think he had a massive impact on my viewing of spoilers and hype in my life in general overall.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's understandable, man.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I do not relate to anything that's being said here pretty much.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Really? Interesting.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Get the hell out, Davoo. Who invited you anyway?

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think that the more familiar you get with a medium or a craft or a scene,

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the more that you can manage your hype emotions.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And with video games at least, I've mastered the arts of no matter what I'm told,

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
no matter what expectation I have, no matter how I feel going into it,

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm able to jujitsu everything around to maximize my enjoyment levels every time I play a game.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't buy that.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think, I totally do.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
People told me that Undertale was like, this cool game that's coming out and like, I don't care.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
People can tell me something is a 12 out of 10 and it doesn't resonate with me at all on its own.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It can depend on who it is that says it.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And with Undertale, people told me you, Davoo, will like it because it's like Mario and Luigi in those kinds of games

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and has similar elements.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm like, whoa, that got me interested.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
When I went into Undertale, I was kind of in a downer mood.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm like, I'm going to try to dislike this just to see how much I like it.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, that's having an effect on you with that right there.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Within 30 seconds, I was completely into it.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, but what if you hadn't been though?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What if you had gone in with that same attempt to be like, I'm going to,

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
because I also played Undertale like, I'm probably not going to like this.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Everyone else is hyping this.

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm just going to fucking shit on it.

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And then I played it and I was like, that's pretty all right.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But like, I think that just speaks to the strength of the game,

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
whereas if it had been a weaker game and I'd went in with those expectations and I would have come out hating it,

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
even though like, I think there's plenty of stuff that's not that good that you can go in underhyped

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and because it exceeds your expectations, you like it more.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, that's the great thing about being underhyped.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All that lower expectations, everything above that just makes it better when you finally see it, usually.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Which is a great thing.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like, for instance, the show that me and D'Vu just watched because he had two for my series,

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Raku Dai Kishi No Cavalry or Chivalry of a Filled Knight,

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
which is like a show that I dropped after the first episode when it was airing

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and I thought it was, you know, pretty shitty.

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But like, people were telling me, oh, it's better than Asterisk War,

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
because it's like kind of the same show.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I was like, well, I'm going to watch it just so I can talk about it in my video

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and I had no expectations.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And so when it turned out to actually be kind of okay,

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it was so much better than I expected it to be.

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That it was like overall a positive experience.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Whereas I've had times...

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That was an anti-hype effect.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, whereas I've had times with shows like that I would give like a 6 out of 10,

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
but because like, my overall feelings about Chivalry were positive,

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
even though I'd give it like a strong 5 to a light 6,

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
whereas say with the Madoka Magica 3rd movie,

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
like, you know, I expected it to be something cool

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and then I just kind of thought it was a 5 or a 6,

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
but it was such a let down that it then was...

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm going to let you finish about Chivalry,

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
but Bushido is the best code of ethics to live by of them all.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Best of all time.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, well, let's talk about that only after they make an anime about it.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's true.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Gabe, you were saying something.

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's hard to put into words what my argument is.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm trying to think because, like, things are hyped for me a lot,

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but I usually only listen to the people I trust the opinions of,

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
like when you guys would tell me to say,

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
this game or this anime is great, you should watch it,

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and I go watch it, and I have a good time,

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
even though like you said, like, you know,

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you especially hype things up a lot.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I say everything's the best ever.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You say everything's the best ever,

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and you're like, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen,

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and I go and see it, and I'm like, yeah, you know,

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't really feel, I don't ever get, like, disappointed

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that something is not the greatest thing I've ever seen.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's because I have the best taste, but, you know.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you saying, like, here's the thing though, Nate.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like, I naturally don't feel, I don't get disappointed like that,

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the other person to me.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I think, Nate, that the problem with hype,

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
because, yeah, now that Hippo mentions it,

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it's super ironic that you are anti-hype,

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but you hype people up all the time.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't want to be hyped.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't care about other people.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They can deal with it.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The problem is that I think everyone has that same mindset though,

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
that everyone thinks that their taste is great,

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and that everyone's going to like the stuff they like,

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and I think that's where a lot of hype comes from,

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
because, like, for me, you know, sort of like DeVoo,

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm pretty resistant to hype for the most part,

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
where, like, I only really get hyped for stuff

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
if, like, people who really know me are hyping me for it, you know?

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because of the fact that I don't think many people like the things I like,

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
or dislike the things I dislike,

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
where, you know, like, with the current season shows,

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
like, erased, where there's all these people hyping fucking erased,

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and everyone's shitting on me for not liking it and stuff,

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and it's like, yeah, but if you knew my taste,

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
then this should be obvious.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, everyone should know that I'm not going to like this show,

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
so when people hype it, I wasn't buying into it,

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
because I'm like, what do you like?

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, what are the other shows you like?

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They obviously are not to my taste.

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's one thing if, like, if someone who likes all the same shows I like,

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you know, hypes me for a new show,

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and I'd be like, well, you know, I'm generally in my experience,

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
we've loved all the same things, so now I'm excited, you know?

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, that's the thing, that's why I so look forward to recommendations from DeVoo,

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
because DeVoo likes tons of shit that I like,

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and too, it's in terms of games.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You guys both seem to like really unique games.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's true.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Really, like you were saying, there's kind of two different ways of being hyped for something.

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's like personal accounts of people you know telling you how good it is,

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and that kind of shit, and I guess the lines are kind of blurred

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
since we're online figures who get comments from people,

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but the other one is the endless cascade of people talking about shit,

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
like the new Star Wars or whatever.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There's literally no way to not be hyped for it,

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because everyone in the fucking world is talking about it.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think I generally take hype not very seriously at all.

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I see that there's hype for Star Wars, for example,

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and then I would go to all the reviewer and analysis people that I know

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
if they're talking about it and what they think,

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and then I would form an opinion based on that.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The fact that there's hype on something,

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
like everybody's raving about this new thing,

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I would look into it before feeling excited at all,

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
even if it was like a sequel to a game that I really liked or something.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's talk about Resistance 2 and or knowing how to manage hype

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
versus just being jaded generally.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Resistance 2 Fall of Man for the PlayStation 3 is the greatest game I've ever made.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because I would say I'm somewhat resistant to hype,

292
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but I think I would just say that's more that I'm generally jaded,

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
because when someone tells me something's good, I just don't believe them.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Even if I'm just...

295
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Fall of Man was Resistance 1. I'm just pointing this out.

296
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Glad we established that.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I've never played those games, and I think that I hate them actually.

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They're all right.

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If I saw all the Undertale hype going on now,

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and I hadn't played it yet, I would think,

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
oh, that game looks stupid.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sure it's not as good as everyone says it is.

303
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I have this friend who recommended me this manga called Helc.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Have you guys seen this manga, Helc?

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Anyone know what I'm fucking talking about?

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, man.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You told me a little about it yesterday, but no.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Helc. It's great.

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I have one friend who just said,

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
read this, it's awesome.

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And I was like, okay, one person says it's awesome.

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's like...

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No matter how highly one person praises something,

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
that's still just a little tiny blip on the hype radar,

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
no matter how glowing the review is.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I don't know.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I read it, and because I only had that little tiny bit of hype,

318
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I thought it was pretty good, and I was like,

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
oh, yeah, okay, I actually like it.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Anyway, I guess the point I'm trying to make

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is that I just don't believe anything is going to be good,

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
no matter how many people tell me it is.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's good.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And in fact, the more people tell me that something's good,

325
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and I don't know for a fact that it is good,

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the more I start to be like, no, it isn't.

327
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, it's not.

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, it's not in my head.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They're clearly lying.

330
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're clearly just bought into the hype.

331
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I feel very differently that I accept that sometimes

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
my taste might be very normal.

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So if a lot of people like something,

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I might like it as well.

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm not as much of a hipster, I think, is the terror.

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's true.

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't think you are.

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Ironically, despite everything I just said,

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and despite how much of a fucking hipster I am,

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I still find that when lots of people like something,

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I tend to like it too.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah, I think it's pretty good.

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And it makes me really mad.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's pretty gay to...

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I hate people who instantly have this knee-jerk reaction

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
of, if everyone is saying it's great that it must be terrible

347
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because people are all secretly sheep and they're stupid.

348
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Jesse, I feel that way.

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Intellectually, I feel that way.

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If everyone likes something, I feel like I'm going to hate it,

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but in practice, it always ends up being

352
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that if something's wicked popular, I end up liking it too.

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, there's usually...

354
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Like, home-stuck and undertale.

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And I'll bet if I saw the new Star Wars, I would think it was fucking great,

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
even though I want to hate it so much.

357
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's usually a reason why a billion people like something.

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
See, that's the thing, though.

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There's an interesting correlation here

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
between marketing and hype.

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because on 4chan, all the time, you'll see false flaggers

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
who just make threads praising something,

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and they do it in a way that's obviously like a shilling sort of way

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
of praising it in an attempt to draw hatred for that thing.

365
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And then there's...

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This has happened many times.

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There's been actual shills on 4chan who just come in

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and are like, guys, how have you not bought a PS4 yet?

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It is by far the best system.

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm playing it every day with my hot girlfriend.

371
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you doing with your life?

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I got to...

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
In response to what Ben said, though,

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think it's sort of a...

375
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know if false positive is the right phrase for this.

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Anyway, I think that you're looking at it backwards,

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
because...

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I am?

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, maybe the things you like tend to be popular,

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but that doesn't mean that the things that are popular

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
tend to be things that you like.

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
For instance, if we measure just sheer popularity,

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
like Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
are the most popular games,

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and I don't think any of us give a fuck about them.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I have never played any of those.

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Maybe I'd love them.

388
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I did a huge research project four years ago,

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or maybe even five, on my anime list,

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
where I was looking into all of my favorite shows

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and trying to measure how my tastes stand up to everyone else's,

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
because I consider my anime list to be a really good gauge

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for the common man anime fan.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
A lot of the stuff that's the highest rated

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
or the most popular on the site is stuff I don't care about.

396
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
However, all of my favorite shows were well rated on the site

397
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and were pretty popular.

398
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
None of them were something that no one had ever heard of.

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
None of them were below a 7.5 rating.

400
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They're all pretty well liked and pretty popular.

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not that I like everything that's popular.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's just that the things I like do align with some other people.

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Nothing I like is so out there that no one else knows about it

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or no one else cares about it.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I guess I would say I'm in pretty much the same boat there.

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think the big thing that I don't relate to

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
is this idea that your different perspectives

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
have to blend together into one overall.

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There's something that's talked about

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
in the beginning of A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schiel

411
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
about the art of game design, about how to analyze a game while you play it.

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's called the Holographic Experience,

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
in which you play the game purely while simultaneously

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you're like a ghost looking at yourself

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and studying it at the same time.

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It sounds very Buddhist.

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
In becoming an analyst, I'm able to do that.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm able to look at all these different perspectives

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
at the same time.

420
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm able to think about its cultural perspective,

421
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
my baggage going into it,

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
because baggage can be interesting.

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Baggage can be from Louis Vuitton.

424
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It can be really luxury.

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I can enjoy everything simultaneously.

426
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't need... I really think that my experience...

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
These Time Cube references are very distracting.

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't pay attention to your point when you keep saying simultaneously.

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Basically, it's about the Time Cube principle.

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm looking at four different timelines

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
of my experience at once.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You can't say the top and bottom are sides,

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
so obviously they don't count.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They're not part of the queue.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm looking at two Radgai Kishinokavari, whatever.

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was like, oh, I guess it's going to be decent.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I really think that my opinion of it

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
was not overall changed by my expectations.

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Episode 11 happened and I'm like, oh, that was terrible.

440
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't like this show.

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't think it's that your opinion is swayed by your expectations.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't think that's necessarily what we're arguing.

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's more the overall experience.

444
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Like I said, Cavalry and Madoka Movie 3,

445
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I would give the same score.

446
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's just a matter of one I went into with no expectations

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and because it exceeded them so much,

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
then it was like, wow, I experienced something that was better

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
than I expected it to be and that makes me feel good.

450
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Whereas with Madoka, it was like,

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I expected to see like a seven out of ten

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and I got like a five and so it was a disappointment,

453
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
even though I like both shows the same amount.

454
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Do those feelings last at all

455
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
or are they just like memories of having feelings?

456
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think they continue to last

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
because I still have a sour feeling over the Madoka Movie

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
just because I felt like it should have been better.

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So in that way, it would be like,

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the best idea would to be to assume that everything is shit.

461
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, pretty much.

462
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But I can't do that though.

463
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's what I'm saying. All hype is bad.

464
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Negative hype makes you experience a work more positively.

465
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I can't do that like legitimately.

466
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can pretend to say, this is going to be bad.

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, nobody can force themselves to think that way.

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I usually have a very positive outlook,

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
but I don't have a very high one.

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
My point came out a whole lot less cogent.

471
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But I never get really blown away either.

472
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My point came out a whole lot less cogent

473
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
because I was sitting on it for 20 minutes

474
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and when I sit on something for 20 minutes,

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it comes out really uncogent.

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's what your mom said about my dick.

477
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I just get really anxious when I sit on it for too long.

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It wasn't cogent.

479
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If I interrupted everyone at the beginning,

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
it would have come out really eloquent.

481
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Well, here's something I've been sitting on for 20 fucking minutes.

482
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It doesn't affect my enjoyment level.

483
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It can make it better and it never makes it worse.

484
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Here's something I've been sitting on for 20 minutes.

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It was at the risk of bringing this up too early

486
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and it would have just ended the whole conversation.

487
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I wanted to detail Yahtzee's feelings on hype

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that he shared in a video once.

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Are you talking about the Punnett Square?

490
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, it's the square where he says

491
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
if you go into something with high expectations

492
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and it meets those expectations

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
then it'll be great.

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
If you go into something with high expectations

495
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and it doesn't meet those expectations

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
then you'll feel like shit.

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If you go into something with low expectations

498
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and it turns out to be shit

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
then you won't lose anything.

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If you go in with low expectations

501
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and it turns out to be amazing

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
then it will way exceed your expectations

503
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and it will be great.

504
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Expectations nothing can ever hurt you if you go in with high expectations then sometimes you'll get burned

505
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,480
Sometimes you'll get that transcendent experience like I did with undertale where you have hype and then it's better than you thought and like

506
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,560
What do you want to do? Do you want to spend your life avoiding harm?

507
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,440
I just think I think that when you I think you should just manage your hype

508
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,400
Carefully there are there are movies. I've seen where like okay

509
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,960
My brother Victor has a tendency to hype things like when he likes it because yeah, like like like all of us

510
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,240
He's fairly jaded and fairly, you know critical

511
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,960
But he also has pretty different tastes from me and like it's funny because it's weird to him

512
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,760
Like he's so used to us having the same taste that when he likes something that I don't really care about then

513
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,040
It's like he doesn't expect it and it's kind of jarring

514
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,440
So he'll hype me for stuff that he likes and then I'll watch it and I'll be like I

515
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:01,160
Didn't really like it just seemed okay to me and he'll be like what like I can't I can't grasp that you didn't like this as much

516
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,600
As I did you know so like I have had times where like like we watched this movie

517
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,720
Confessions which is like one of his top three favorite movies and like I watched it and it was just kind of like I

518
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,000
Expected so much more just because he kept talking about how much he loved it and then I was like I don't like I don't get it

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,160
You know

520
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,520
So I feel like if I had just seen it with no expectations

521
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:30,040
It would have probably been better than then with the ones I did have but like I do think that there is some value in like

522
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,040
Managing your hype and like getting if I think if you know you're gonna love something then yeah

523
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,880
Let yourself get hype for it. Like I but can you ever really know that?

524
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,960
I think you can because I think there's times where the hype is like it doesn't matter

525
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,920
It won't change it like for last year the most hype

526
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,400
I got about anything was for the video game dengeki bunko fighting climax

527
00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,040
Oh, right out in like September no October and I was hyped for it for like six months because it's a game where you play as

528
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Characters from dengeki bunko light novels and it's a 2d fighting game and like I love 2d fighting games inherently

529
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,000
I'll play any of them, you know, and I love that I got to beat up all these characters that I hate

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
You were in this game

531
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,400
I get to beat up Kirito and Shana or play Shana and beat up Kirito

532
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,720
I get to play characters. I like characters. I hate and like it didn't even matter to me if the game was going to be like

533
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:31,880
Legitimately good or not like it was gonna be worth the price of admission just for the experience of a 2d fighter where I can beat up

534
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,480
Kirito, that's true. That's a pretty safe bet

535
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,520
Yeah, no matter what it was gonna be cool

536
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:43,200
So I got really hype for it and it did end up being as good as I wanted it to be like it was every bit as fun as I

537
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,320
hoped it would be and so like I felt like it was money well-spent

538
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,520
Well, you know, did you an example that involves you actually for me was when I

539
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,160
Tried to watch log horizon because this was after seeing your like 10 out of 10 video and I was like well

540
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,600
I have to check this out. This sounds exactly like what I like

541
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,640
and I think that I would have liked it more if I hadn't had these crazy expectations and

542
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,520
Like I got specifically I was looking forward to like the arguments you made of like the whole food thing

543
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,480
How it like changed the world and everything it does to the story and that stuff was in fact interesting

544
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,360
But I really was just on the lookout for like, okay, this is a 10 out of 10. I need to study it

545
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,960
I need to be looking for why this is the case

546
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,320
Yeah, and as a problem like when I watched along horizon

547
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,400
I had only heard that it was mediocre. No one ever told me it was good

548
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,360
We came in with totally opposite expectations. Yeah. Yeah, I think your relationship with hype

549
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Can needs to be changed and evolved as your relationship with that medium or that genre

550
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,280
Changes, I think that I think hype is very important to get someone into a thing

551
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,280
You keep talking about anime. I didn't have enough people

552
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Hyping me up to anime shows. I I didn't all the people who I talked to even if they were anime fans

553
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,720
They were way too polite. They weren't if they had jumped down my throat. You had the weirdest anime fans around you, man

554
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,880
I've never met an anime fan who was like that. I've only met like a evangelical everyone must watch Naruto

555
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Or else kill themselves

556
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
evangelicals and

557
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,160
I and so as a result I didn't get into anime until like I didn't really get into it until like two years ago

558
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I didn't I didn't I wasn't gonna get into my little pony until a friend of mine said you've got to watch this

559
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,360
You gotta watch that and thank God

560
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,400
Yeah, Ben Ben told me to watch Milo, but Jesse would you describe it? Yeah, it was the best thing I ever did for you

561
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,520
What's going on? Are you are you an evangelical Jesse?

562
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,200
Never mind. You're you're not a fast enough move on

563
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,640
I think that hype is really important to get someone into a thing and that as you get more familiar with it

564
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,200
You can learn more about it or is that my knowledge that it exists and that it's generally okay

565
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,800
I do think it's hype

566
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,360
I think that I think I've when when I want people to get into anime

567
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,560
I do involve hype although at the same time when I'm trying to like I

568
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,320
Lately I try my hardest to not hype people when I introduced into something, you know

569
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,440
Like I'll say like when I tried to get you into a shield hero yesterday. I was just like it's a good manga

570
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,000
I think you'll like it. I did that I read the whole thing yesterday. Yeah, I saw you reading it

571
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,880
But like I was just like yeah, it's pretty good. Like it's not amazing, but it's pretty good. You should read it

572
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,200
I think you will like it. I don't think yeah, I think it's a 10 out of 10

573
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,560
But like yeah, you know

574
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,720
I think my expectations were just a tad bit above where they should have been I did read it

575
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I liked the whole thing, but nothing like

576
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,920
Super-duper amazing happened which was what you were saying, but I didn't calibrate my expectations quite properly

577
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,720
All of your like 10 out of 10 recommendations can be a great

578
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Proof that I am good at not being overhyped or underhyped or anything at the time

579
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,920
You gave like an 8 out of 10 to kill la kill and so I watched it

580
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,360
I was like this is a 10 and then you gave like a 10 out of 10 to log horizon and I watched it

581
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm like I have some problems. So I give it a 9 you gave a 10 to ghost in a cell standalone complex

582
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,240
And I watched it and I was like I agree

583
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,320
This is a 10 you gave a 9 to serial experiments Lane and I watched it and like I don't get it

584
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,680
So I gave it a 6 and so like I think that there's I think I'm able to

585
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,240
For some reason I am making my points so much worse than I thought I did I think I'm getting overhyped about my own points

586
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,800
I legitimately think that's a thing that you go through a lot

587
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:41,160
I've watched you overhype yourself for your own points in the past in

588
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,880
Conversations, I've also watched you overhype your own abilities where you're like

589
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm gonna have this done by the end of the day and then and the funny thing is

590
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,400
Every time DeVu has ever told me when he's gonna finish a video. I always tack a day on in my mind

591
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,120
He'll always say like I'm gonna have this done by like 10 p.m. And in my head. I'm like tomorrow, you know

592
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,200
He's like, okay

593
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,000
It's gonna be a few more hours cuz my internet died or because this or that went wrong and I always I never let myself

594
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
When the video is gonna be I

595
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Lots of people do it lots of people do it, but guy is particularly bad not to overhype myself

596
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,840
But I am the best in the world at missing my own deadlines massive

597
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Yeah, I've got like like there is one medium that is ruined by hype for me and that is analysis videos because

598
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,560
What the fuck those things don't I mean hype they do I hype them

599
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Nobody else in the world

600
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Aside from this group of people

601
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,680
Okay, nobody else goes holy shit guys, there's a new mr. Beaton

602
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,040
I was like guys you have to go fucking. Yeah, and then I ultimately don't care if I agree with anyone's opinions on any game

603
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Any movie any show but if one of us thinks that some analysis is a 10 out of 10

604
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:10,200
And I don't or I do and that bothers me it bothers me that did you like nerd writer so much and won't

605
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,560
Criticize him as much as I want to and that bothers me

606
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,940
Wait, how much do you think I like nerd writer? I have no idea, but you gave me a top

607
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,080
You praised him pretty glowingly. I mean he is making

608
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,200
unbelievably consistent videos every good. Oh, they're consistent

609
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,480
Oh, I can do their kids. Oh, they're consistent, and they have nice down quality

610
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,240
All right nerd writer has made about a hundred fucking videos last year

611
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,440
Like and all of them have a little bit of intrigue in them

612
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,120
And that's a lot of intrigue when you add it all up if you watch all of this

613
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm sure I want to watch all of this even if he only makes one point per video in the end

614
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,880
He's made 52 points Nate put out one video last year. Yeah, and I fucking crushed that

615
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,400
But you didn't put out any other fucking videos

616
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,240
So I think there's a value in something like I am way

617
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I am more likely to stay

618
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,160
Excited for someone's channel if they keep putting out content all the time and I'm like oh man

619
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,200
You're hitting me with every different side nerd writer puts out videos on paintings never seen someone

620
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Obviously on YouTube

621
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,620
I've never seen someone analyze poetry on YouTube before he covers

622
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,180
No one covers comics the way he covers comics. He makes videos but every subject matter in existence

623
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,100
That's what interesting about him

624
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:39,340
They're all too short and they all feel like they stop short of saying anything really substantial about whatever he's talking

625
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,260
I mean, that's true

626
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:47,700
But they still make a point in the end like there's still something interesting in there like we made the video about the

627
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:56,020
He made a video about the the painting that says this is not a pipe and he's like the point of this painting is that it's not a pipe

628
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,860
It's a representation of a pipe and therefore, you know when we look at images

629
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,500
We describe them as that's a like if I showed you a picture of a pipe, you'd say that's a pipe

630
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,700
But it's not a pipe. It's a representation of a pipe and it's a study of language interesting point

631
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,420
I hadn't not that interesting because that but what you just related to me is information that is obvious to any thinking person at a

632
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,920
Glance and I do not need to spend two minutes

633
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,980
Painting I would never have thought about that. Did you that's very obvious. That's literally the entire point of the painting

634
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,940
I've never seen the painting, but okay, here's the thing

635
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,180
Writer makes videos about things. I've never seen before is interesting enough in itself

636
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,100
I've never seen any of the movies. He's talked about except like children of men. I've never seen any of the paintings

637
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,420
He's talked about

638
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,980
Except maybe nightcrawlers, but I didn't know what it meant. I just seen it

639
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,420
I don't give a fuck. I've never thought about a painting before nerd writer has taught me to think about a font about a painting

640
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,020
Don't understand paintings at all. I just look at him. I'm like what the fuck is that? It's colors. I don't care

641
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,500
It doesn't move. It doesn't have dialogue. I don't fucking. I don't want to look at it

642
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,020
You know it really into the fact that he's had would you look at a painting if it had subtitles?

643
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,980
Well, they were Japanese this is not a pipe has subtitles and I still wouldn't have thought about what it meant, you know

644
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,820
I like I just want to go back to

645
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,960
Managing hype because that's the topic. Yes

646
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,540
The way the way that I manage hype

647
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,500
I've realized is that I base it completely on research for example

648
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,460
Dark Souls 3 is coming out soon and I'm extremely hyped for that because I know that the director is the same guy as Dark Souls 1

649
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
Miyazaki I forget his first name

650
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,180
Yeah, that's actually wrong. You know what that's that's actually that brings me to a great point though

651
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,660
Here's something we've all been skipping out on and Nate you kind of touched on this with like a risk in feeling

652
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,500
I I do think that there is a value in

653
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,300
Experiencing extreme disappointment. Yeah, I think that there are some things that you should just go all in

654
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,900
Let yourself get hyped for and just be crushed by because it can it can lead to

655
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,820
Years of you cathartically bashing it like Dark Souls 2

656
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,660
Very true

657
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,660
You know like with with Demon Souls because I don't know but I'm sure you guys probably played Dark Souls first

658
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:25,140
But like my friends were hyped for Demon Souls before that even came out because one of my friends is a huge from software fan

659
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,660
He was into armored core and all that shit and he was really excited for Demon Souls

660
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,540
So that came out and it exceeded everyone's expectations

661
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,660
We were super excited and then they were making Dark Souls and we all got like really hype and it came out and everyone was kind

662
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,700
Of like undecided at first like no one could decide if it was as good as years for people to figure out

663
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,460
Yeah, well cuz it you know at first it it had like a little bit more cheapness to it

664
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,660
And they also ironed a lot of stuff out in patches, you know, that was a problem

665
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,540
Yeah early part, but like, you know, it was kind of tepid but then people were like oh man

666
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,180
Dark Souls is the greatest game ever and then people got really hype and then they're like Dark Souls 2 and we're all like

667
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,340
Oh fuck yeah, and at this time no one knew about the like how important he did Takamiyazaki was or how like you know

668
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,300
Changing directors would change everything or any of that we were just like it's another Dark Souls

669
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,540
You know and then Dark Souls 2 came out and everyone played it and they're like oh, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty good

670
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,060
But it's not as good as Dark Souls one and then over time it just like you know

671
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,140
It just right people think about it a huge issue right and then like when Bloodborne was coming out

672
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,100
Then it was like well should we get hype like I want to get hype

673
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,580
But yeah, that's gonna be like Dark Souls 2, but Miyazaki's directing it again. Maybe it'll be amazing

674
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,940
Maybe I should stake it all on the line, you know

675
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,020
It was great. You're like all right. Well Miyazaki's never disappointed me

676
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,540
So surely Dark Souls 3, surely surely Dark Souls 3, surely

677
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,300
That's where I am right now. Yeah, I'm actually considering buying the collectors edition for that

678
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,620
And like if Dark Souls 3 turns out to be a huge piece of shit

679
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
We will talk about it for ever

680
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,020
It will be legendary if we like we will never shut up about it

681
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,860
You know and like I think there's some value in that worth like because when I think about

682
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,180
Hype and the dangers of hype the biggest thing that comes to mind is watchdogs because it was a game that was

683
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,540
Way overhyped for years all the trailers completely were misleading

684
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,820
They all made it look like it was gonna be this really deep like next-gen game

685
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,140
No one had ever seen like this level of like polish in a game before going by the trailers

686
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,900
Which were completely false, you know, and then it came out and it was just kind of a shitty talking about right

687
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,740
It wasn't even interesting. It was mediocre

688
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,580
So then and the thing is that game had sold so many like pre-order bonuses and special editions and everyone who got them got

689
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,020
Burned everyone special edition was like I shouldn't have got the special edition

690
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,980
It wasn't that good of a game games these like a lot of triple a games are more about the trailers than the game right

691
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,220
They're about establishing pre-order while like generating hype for the people who felt all that hype and then were let down

692
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,460
Like I'm sure that they they hate it and they wish they had that money back

693
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,740
And they wish they hadn't played that game

694
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:58,140
But like as a cultural thing it was kind of awesome to watch because it was like, you know watching this mighty like

695
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,500
Opening of the the fjord of people realizing that oh my god

696
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,020
Hype is bad and I should stop buying these expensive like you know, I my friend

697
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:13,980
My friend Josh who buys like special editions of everything like he was so burned by watchdogs that it made him rethink his buying habits

698
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,500
You know and like what what was in the special edition of watchdogs. I don't fucking know. It's probably like $95 though

699
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,220
It has Aiden's iconic hat. Oh good

700
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
I

701
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,020
Wanted I want to do we stop coming over on the topic on a cat nice while we're on the topic of our personal

702
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,740
Stories and personal and like particular height. Yeah, I wanted everyone to share a horror story

703
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,980
I want to talk about my own personal hype tragedy, please which was spore. I was gonna say I bet it was four

704
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,200
Yeah, yeah fucking spore tell us when the original trailer for spore came out. We'll write

705
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,360
You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know about I was big on this for hype

706
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,760
Lots of people were people all over. Yeah, will write came out and demoed this version of spore

707
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
Which was so fun

708
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,680
It looked so fucking robust and it looked like it just it made it look like anything was possible

709
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,440
And it played this this little like dinosaur man

710
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,400
And he just like twisted it around and like gave it three legs and it procedurally generated this perfect-looking walk cycle on three legs

711
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,280
And then he showed off all these other hypothetical monsters and they all had

712
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,360
Like yeah, they all like wobbled around realistically according to their weight and like he

713
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,200
It all just looks so real and visceral and like nothing that had ever existed before and then he zoomed out and you saw the solar system

714
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,760
And he zoomed out and you saw the whole galaxy and it was like oh my god

715
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,200
There's so much possibility and it's all gonna be procedurally generated and there's gonna be so much emergent content

716
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,360
And it's gonna be amazing and for two fucking years people talked about this shit for two fucking years

717
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,760
People said oh, here's what I'm gonna make in spore. Here's what I'm gonna make in spore

718
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,320
It's gonna be the greatest thing ever and then it came out and it looks nothing like the demo

719
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,360
It doesn't work. It doesn't it doesn't even behave similarly

720
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,040
I mean it kind of superficially resembles the demo

721
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,600
But it's not the same game and it doesn't have the same tone or atmosphere or capabilities

722
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Yeah, and the whole thing was clearly just a fucking fabricated farce of a goddamn pre-rendered trailer because there's because there's no dang

723
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,040
Way you could do anything in the trailer that was in the dang final release, you know

724
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,680
And gosh, I'm still so salty about I'm with you

725
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,840
I think that will write in this case had the absolute best of intentions and thought he'd be able to do it

726
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,440
But I think when reality that's that fucking Peter Mullin. He was he was just channeling Peter Mullin

727
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,020
He's he really was that's the thing though

728
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,220
These people have really lofty goals put Peter Mullin you especially and will write in a lot too in this case

729
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,800
They want to do all the stuff and they they plan as if they'll be able to do it and they market it on these

730
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,400
Hypothetical like we'll definitely be able to do this and then like when they don't respect that in principle

731
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,840
I don't respect in principle at all

732
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,480
You cannot tell people that you are going to do X if you don't know for sure you can do it

733
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:56,440
I mean, I think what they should do though is if I think when this is the problem with the games marketing is that they will never

734
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,160
Admit it when it's not that you know like if like when fucking

735
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,360
When Peter Mullin you hypes up fucking fable 2 or whatever and says all this shit

736
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,960
Then when the game's about to come out and it doesn't have those capabilities. He should come out and say by the way

737
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
It's not gonna be like that. It's gonna be like this

738
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
We couldn't we didn't have the budget to make it as

739
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,600
Here's what Peter Mullin who does fable 2 comes out and it's a piece of shit, but he doesn't admit it

740
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,520
Until he starts hyping fable 3 right? Oh, yeah, great

741
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,000
You know I know we I had such great hopes for fable 2, but it ended up it was nothing like I wanted to be

742
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,840
It was basically a piece of shit, but I'm gonna accomplish everything I set out to do with it

743
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,640
And more and fable 3 fable 3 will finally be the great game

744
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,280
I've been promised then they come out and the same fucking thing when will they learn

745
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,840
Triple A the video game big budget hype machine is the worst type machine. Yeah, especially

746
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,220
There's a huge issue of like I don't know

747
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,580
Really deception like something like Dark Souls 2 does not look anything like the

748
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,540
Videos that they show it looks like shit compared to the video all they had to do it

749
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,220
They knew it right like I'm sure because the thing is with Dark Souls 2

750
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,140
I'm sure that they did intend that system to be in there because if you look at Bloodborne

751
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,660
It does have like the torches and the lighting right like that was supposed to be in Dark Souls 2

752
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:25,220
But yeah, they should have just put out a statement. Hey this trailer no longer represents what the game is, you know, right?

753
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,080
It would have been so easy and and you you know, it'll disappoint people

754
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,540
But like at least it'll be honest and they won't fucking hate your guts from that on

755
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,040
Everything you say, you know hide behind shit like oh those trailers like they were just in development

756
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,920
But they never show you what it's actually gonna look like once it comes out

757
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,400
All you've got to base your thoughts on are the demos that they showed where it looks good or whatever

758
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,400
But you know like we're talking about how like companies literally just lie about what things are gonna be in regards to hype

759
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,680
But like that's like the worst case scenario. That's not even what you should normally is normally the issue with hype

760
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,760
There's it's it's it's everything before that about like expectations being set too high and then them not being met or you know

761
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,600
That that whole gamble you're taking me to do that the whole business is lying to you thing is the worst-case scenario really

762
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,400
I'm trying to like think of what my most like

763
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,240
Hyped up for something and then it wasn't yeah, it's a way to I think it's like I think for me

764
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I would I would say that like

765
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:29,720
Because I'm so slow to actually get around to stuff my hype usually like just diminishes over time where like for instance when I was

766
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Like a teenager

767
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,800
I was really into JRPGs and I just kept buying JRPGs because I was excited for all of them

768
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,680
And I just kept buying them

769
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,320
But I would never beat them or I would never play them very far and then it was just kind of like as I grew up

770
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,200
I sort of realized that those games were probably not gonna be fun

771
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,140
You know like a lot of the ones that I thought that like you know like I bought all the knee-punny

772
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,220
Gucci games at one point like cuz those have diminishing returns hard

773
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,820
Yeah, you go further in the series like cuz you know this guy a one everyone loved it

774
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,820
I had played a bunch of it

775
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,700
I thought it was pretty cool

776
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,200
But then like just because of like the idea of the company that it was like this this small

777
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:14,900
Publisher of like really interesting tactics games that no one was talking about you know and that were often hard to come by and I bought like you

778
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,020
know

779
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,700
Like lapissel tactics and fucking

780
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:26,300
Lapissel tactics was such a snorkel. Yeah, I gave up on that within like the first couple of hours

781
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,840
I bought lapissel. I bought fucking phantom brave

782
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,140
I bought Makaya for real and I bought this guy

783
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:37,820
And like I had all those games for a long time and like I played the first like a couple hours of lapissel as a kid

784
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,020
And like I just didn't understand mechanics

785
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,580
So like this is something I did a lot when I was younger

786
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,620
I would buy games and then play them and not really get them and that'd be like well

787
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,060
I'll probably get around to it in the future and I just hold on to these games forever

788
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,580
And then finally like ten years later

789
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,900
I put in lapissel and tried to play it and I realized it's just boring, you know

790
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,700
So like I feel like my hype back then was like all of these games are gonna be great one day

791
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,740
And then eventually I realized that I was just deluding myself and I don't know where I got this hype from you know

792
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:14,740
I hate the waiting sitting around waiting checking every preview that comes out waiting for it to come out

793
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:22,140
I ended that personally in 2008 with brawl because I was waiting for that so intensely and the delays

794
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:28,020
Killed my soul off in half so much and I played it. I'm like, oh, it's it's just like melee

795
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,180
You you sit down and have a good time for for infinity. It's not something

796
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,580
Yeah, I've never had like like a lot of I've never waited for a thing to come out like I I've I

797
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,620
Want Dark Souls 3 to come out really soon and it is and I'm happy that it's coming out

798
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,460
But I haven't been waiting for it. You know, I haven't been looking trailers

799
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,740
I don't really care to look here's here's what like information for man. That was for me

800
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,300
I just want to buy it when it comes out. Here's what more than years

801
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,380
I spent crawling around on spore forums just like fucking hyping myself up

802
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:03,100
Oh, no more than I don't get about waste of my god cycle is like most of these games are

803
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,700
Are going to be like a week of your life not anything past that like yeah

804
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,740
All the time you've already put in right people spend like years hyping themselves for a game

805
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:21,180
And then you beat it in like, you know 20 hours and it's like why did you like was that really worth that level of hype?

806
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,700
Like, you know, and then people get let down and I watched like my brother victor

807
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,980
He always lets himself get into the hype cycle because like he'll you know, he'll he only plays games once usually

808
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,580
Like it's very rare only like the souls games and like, you know a few other like games that he really truly loves

809
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,460
Well, he played more than once most games. He'll just get it and forget it

810
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,140
But he'll let himself

811
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:47,580
Like, you know constantly watch trailers and watch all the nintendo directs and get like all excited for games

812
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,580
And then like he spent like two and a half years being hyped for zeno blade chronicles x

813
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:56,540
And it came out and it was complete like, you know, and the thing is he'll you'll trick yourself

814
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,540
Like he spent the first like 35 hours like trying to convince himself that it was great

815
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:06,220
And then in the end just realized it was a huge disappointment. You know, I just I just remember the best example of all time

816
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,060
Final fantasy 13

817
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,300
Like i'm the biggest final fantasy fan in the entire universe and I too spent

818
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,980
You know 60 hours trying to like that game either writing was on the wall before 13 came out

819
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,180
So I didn't allow myself to get hyped for that one because dude. I loved 11. I loved 12 was a good game

820
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,220
But like

821
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,780
Now 12 was a good game but 11 was like an mmo and then there was advent children

822
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Before that an advent children was like the thing that hurt me more than anything else ever to the point where

823
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,980
For years after advent children came out

824
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,140
I would like lie to myself and I still wouldn't want to admit how much I hated it

825
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,700
But then like every time I saw it subsequently

826
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,860
I I had to admit a little bit that's the thing

827
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:54,060
I I followed the chronicles of the compilation of final fantasy 7 shit so tightly like every scrap of information

828
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,420
Was like gold to me was like pure orgasm through my whole body

829
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:04,860
And like only this year have I finally realized I was I was just being fucking duped a whole fucking time

830
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
And it was so like and it was so like

831
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,500
Real and like such a juicy betrayal to me because it was because back in those days

832
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,700
Like I put my heart and soul into that series. It was like I was like

833
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,580
Like 14 or 13 when advent children came out or something. Yeah 15 16 hours

834
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,700
Fucking the baby, you know, like it was like before I had access to the internet or anything

835
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:33,340
So to me final fantasy 7 was just my thing and it was this beautiful thing from my childhood and no one else could ever

836
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:38,700
You know tarnish it and and oh my god. They're they're making a sequel to my game

837
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,660
And then I and then it's not just a ever made like a

838
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Philosophical thing like on principle. I will heighten myself down

839
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,780
The more you learn about the context of the way things come out the more, you know

840
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:59,820
Logically it is most likely not going to be like there's nothing that can logically make you guaranteed

841
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,620
That something is going to be great. I don't know if that's true game series any game developer

842
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,900
Any place that a game can come from that will guarantee it being good

843
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,420
Yeah to me and did you I remember you saying that you're like that with anime your last bastion was

844
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,780
Tell you had a one last bastion of like this is definitely going to be good, but it got broken recently. What was it?

845
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:29,260
No, I don't even like most keo any shows. I don't even like half of their shows

846
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:35,820
Um, but there was probably something that was oh, yeah shinichiro watanabe because he what do you mean?

847
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,460
Because he made fucking zankyo no terror and it was complete garbage. Oh, that's right. That's right

848
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,260
Like it was he was like the one director who had only done three shows and they were all amazing

849
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,420
And like everything he'd worked on otherwise was like little artsy stuff and like, you know

850
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,140
It was like he could he couldn't possibly do wrong

851
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:57,820
And then zankyo no terror came out and like the first three episodes or first two episodes are like amazing

852
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,780
And then they're it just spirals down and it's a piece of shit

853
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,900
The only thing that I can rely on to be good is when I know that the people in charge of creating it

854
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,220
Have the same tastes and roughly the same vision as myself

855
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,700
Which is why I do get hyped for some analysis shows because I for one thing

856
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:20,460
There's almost no waiting it comes out and I get hyped in three seconds to watch it and I know where they're coming

857
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:26,140
But you know the scary thing is that over a long period of time how the people behind the work change like

858
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,940
Like with with square enix and like how final fantasy has evolved and morph like it's the same series

859
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,180
But it is not what it once was

860
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,580
I think the internet has helped us a lot because now we can look into that shit. That's true. That's very no

861
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,420
I think I think with

862
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,340
I think every year we get closer and closer to people are paying attention to developers like specifically the people

863
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,420
We're like, you know with dark souls again

864
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,660
No one knew who hitataka miyazaki was until dark souls two sucked

865
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,780
No one no one knew who he was when dark souls one was great

866
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:01,500
People knew who he was when dark souls two sucked and we went for an explanation and the explanation was it wasn't the same director

867
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
You know that was when people went oh

868
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,540
Like that matters, you know like hitataka miyazaki's clearly the guy who's important here, you know

869
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,500
And then it became like well bloodborne's got his name on it. So maybe that'll be worth it

870
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,140
Oh dark souls three has his name on it. Maybe that'll be worth it

871
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,060
You know, but like I think every year we get we get more and more in the internet age

872
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,340
Like we're paying attention to that shit where um, you know, uh, I think that's good. It's true

873
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,860
It's it's a it's a hopeful sentiment and I I think yeah, but even then

874
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,420
I would be for the next the next thing that toby fox makes right sure

875
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,220
Absolutely

876
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,980
I think the more people are involved the more you need to look into it because like with

877
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,300
What davoo said about shinichiro watanabe like I just assumed everything he made would be good

878
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
But then like, you know

879
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:50,140
The writing staff and the people behind zankyo no terror were not the same people who wrote his other shows

880
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,580
You know, we're like he used a lot of the same staff on cowboy bebop and on uh and on you know

881
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,900
Samurai shampoo and it's like the writers for this show

882
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,100
Were the problem like the directing was not the problem with zankyo no terror

883
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,380
He did his job

884
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:09,020
It's just that the show had a terrible script and like on you know, he was a failure for not correctly assigning

885
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:15,580
I mean you could say so but like I think because it was his concept of a show and I get why he made it and like

886
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,900
What he was going for it's just that the writing did not deliver on the idea

887
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,620
And I think there was probably a point where

888
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,820
They maybe recognized that or maybe they didn't maybe they just thought it was you know

889
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,460
Maybe they thought the message was more important than that

890
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:36,300
Or they just went ahead with what they had because I don't you love that when people decide that the message of your show

891
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,620
Is more important than the entertainment value. Love that. Well, I I just think that like

892
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,660
I think with that particular show it was partly just they wanted to give him work because like

893
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,220
You know like Masao Mariama had been saying that he'd been trying to get a show with Shinichiro Watanabe for years

894
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:57,260
But it's just that it's too expensive to work with him because he's he's a really ambitious director

895
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,860
And he's going to make stuff look good. And so like I think you know

896
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,620
Mariama is the one who runs mappa and mappa was a fairly new studio

897
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,540
They hadn't really done a lot of work and they wanted to do something with Shinichiro Watanabe

898
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:14,300
And I think that was that's a nice goal. I think that was more important to them than making a well written show

899
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,860
I think they just wanted to make a show with Watanabe and that's why they succeeded

900
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,540
The thing with tobi fox because like at first I was like, oh, yeah the next tobi fox game

901
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:26,780
I'm probably gonna like that right because not only did I love undertale, but I loved

902
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:33,820
But like the ways in which I really liked it felt like tobi was doing things the way I would do them

903
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,140
Like I've made games

904
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,740
A couple years ago

905
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:43,580
What you only like things that are the way that you would do them well in the sense that he said trash in the sense that like

906
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,340
It makes me think he comes from a similar place. Obviously. He's better

907
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,620
But he comes from a similar place with similar tastes as me

908
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:55,980
It's not someone who made something that they like that I think is amazing for different reasons, you know

909
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,500
And well, I think that I think that what's good about undertale

910
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,820
I think or or I think I'm kind of agree with you

911
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,220
But for different reasons like I think that the ways in which undertale is good

912
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,420
Suggest a development philosophy that I can write. Yeah

913
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:15,100
Yeah, I think that you can tell that the way he went at it was to think of concepts first and then flesh to think of

914
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,700
Original concepts first and then flesh them out to a mechanic explain that something

915
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,900
I would like to see more like using an opposite like if you

916
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,980
Love sonichu

917
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,300
It's not because you think christian has similar intentions to you

918
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,260
Like you love sonichu for reasons that have nothing to do with why why christian like

919
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,060
I love sonichu for the emotional arc

920
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:43,260
So of the author right that you can glimpse the things you like about sonichu are not what christian intended

921
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,220
You to like about it. Nope. And therefore you could never look forward to his next work in that way

922
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:53,180
Whereas yeah, what's the shirt on my new level I can look at almost any detail and think

923
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,820
I think toby put that there and did that that way for this that and this reason

924
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:03,420
Don't know how accurate I am though because toby his his persona is so

925
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,340
Um timid he like acts like oh, I don't I didn't know

926
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,500
I was just trying to make a game with stuff that I like and everyone loves it. That's nice

927
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,260
I think he's probably like yeah, I'm a genius. I know exactly

928
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,340
I don't know what you're getting that. I mean, I'm sure there's some level of of confidence

929
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,700
I'm sure he's like that only because that's what I would be like

930
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,620
I too would project a facade of like not thinking I was the shit

931
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,860
But then secretly think he literally said all these people giving um 10 out of 10s

932
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,580
I got I you know some people give him an eight give undertale an eight like I expected

933
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,180
But then some people give it a 10 and I'm like you like it that much

934
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,460
Wow, we well frankly toby has absolutely no business trying to judge his game

935
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,940
In the in the world of all games out there and trying to decide where it belongs

936
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:54,540
Absolutely, yeah, I think it's fine. I'm just saying that it makes it a little bit harder like

937
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,940
Is he just accidentally a genius because I don't know what I really need to do

938
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:04,380
Is play other stuff that he's made play his earthbound mods and really get where he's coming from

939
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,900
On the subject of like there's no guarantee

940
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,500
That that like your hype will be justified like you can never know for sure if like the next output by someone's gonna be good

941
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,820
Um, I'm not gonna like the next toby game if it's like an undertale rehatch

942
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,540
I was gonna say yeah, I don't think it will be because what I think was good about undertale was the ways it experimented

943
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:27,980
So it's gonna be totally I'm gonna be looking I'm gonna be looking for like the new ideas that toby has right

944
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,740
And those things are gonna be new and therefore they're gonna be a risk

945
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,140
So there's only a chance that it'll be a really great game if he takes risks

946
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,340
But those risks are gonna come with the possibility that maybe they won't work out as well as they did an undertale

947
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,700
So there's there's really no guarantee. That's what hype is all about. I think it's it's more of a guarantee

948
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:54,620
than like other like just thinking of like it's it's better to think of like, you know, it's not I know but like

949
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,940
It it's better to it's more trying to think of the words

950
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:05,420
Well, you shouldn't you shouldn't get hype for a company's game. Yes, you get hype for the individuals who are making sure

951
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,820
I want to address like ironically the like the fact that to the fact that I expect toby to take a risk

952
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:14,540
Right in in being creative in in his next game like like taking that risk is a

953
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,740
Better is closer to guaranteeing that something will be good

954
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:24,220
Then not taking any risks because that guarantees that it'll be bad to address like devu's point about toby's like attitude

955
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,060
I think, you know

956
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,340
You might think that the things he did were genius

957
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:35,260
And like you might share the same ethos as him like I'm sure he put all those things in his game on purpose

958
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:41,260
And that they all serve the purpose he wanted them to but that doesn't necessarily mean that he thinks that that is genius

959
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:47,020
Like maybe he thinks that all those points he was making are like pretty clever

960
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,340
But like, you know that he doesn't think that it's worth a 10 out of 10

961
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,700
We're like, you know, and it comes down to personal values

962
00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:00,060
Like devu you clearly value the things he did so much that you think it's a 10 out of 10 game

963
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:04,860
I don't you know, like I appreciate all of it and I think I understand all of it

964
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,500
But my values don't mean oh, that's automatically a 10, you know

965
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,220
And I think his surprise is that so many people value that and I'm surprised too

966
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,060
Like I would never have thought looking at undertale that it would get these

967
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:24,860
The sheer level of like game of the years that it got, you know, like yeah, like uh, well, you share nobody's because I definitely think

968
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,100
There's plenty of things that aren't great about it in one interview

969
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,820
He said, you know, I came up with the whole mercy system

970
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,140
And you know, it's kind of it's not that great because it's basically just a bunch of trial and error

971
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,660
But I wrote some decent dialogue to make it good and I read that I'm like, yeah

972
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,060
I agree the the mercy system for most regular enemies is not like that in in

973
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,620
In thralling all the time, but it just goes back to I don't think that something needs to be

974
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,340
Objectively perfect to be a 10 out of 10

975
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,140
Yeah, wait

976
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,180
You have to look at the way that he used it because like what my favorite example

977
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,180
I think of that in the whole game is the way that you have to that you mercy

978
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:05,180
The tsundere plane which involves like you have to come close to it and like brush against it

979
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,780
Which relates to its personality and is like the most genius thing I've ever seen

980
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,700
That's the thing like all of that is genius

981
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:17,500
But it's not necessarily something that you expect people to value where like sure like in a games market where you know

982
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,860
Because if you look at like

983
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:25,580
Game spots game of the year list like that's the one where I what I would have expected where they put undertale at like number 16

984
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,740
You know and like number one is the witcher 3 which is this huge

985
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:35,580
Oh, it's like everything that games journalism seems to value in a game is what the witcher 3 represents

986
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,380
You know what it reminds me of the way that like the oscars judge like best editor

987
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:45,100
It's not like who made like the highest quality game. It's who made like the most game

988
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:50,060
Who put it like the most that just tends to be what most people value is people tend to value like

989
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,060
What's the biggest bestest most insane thing that had to happen?

990
01:01:54,060 --> 01:02:00,060
You know like the the one that's the closest to the gold standard and like you would never expect that a fucking

991
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,700
A game that looks like it was on the goddamn

992
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:08,380
NES would be the you know would be anyone's game of the year pick from like a professional journalist

993
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,220
You know you can imagine I think the point I was trying to make earlier. Yeah, I get

994
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,940
the the point was um

995
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,580
You shouldn't ever think that a person

996
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,140
Being on a team or like a company making a game would guarantee

997
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,700
Even if they have a good track record

998
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,900
You should never think that it guarantees it to be good, but it can it's okay to like

999
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:36,700
Feel a little better about all this discussion and no one has mentioned metal gear solid 5 which burned all of you

1000
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:44,460
I was trying not to mention it and not to think about it. So thank you so much. I totally forgot about that. Yeah

1001
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:51,340
Oh, Jesus christ. I didn't even remember that. Yeah, it's same director who made all the other games

1002
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:59,100
Now there was a lot of drama around it when it came out which kind of maybe sort of absolves him a little bit

1003
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,860
We won't know exactly whether

1004
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,340
Kojima himself is responsible until we see his next game and if it's really good then

1005
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,580
I am well you actually

1006
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:12,140
You can look closer and you can see patterns here because he didn't write the games himself

1007
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,020
Alone until metal gear solid 4

1008
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,740
Everything 1 2 and 3 were written by some other guy who's much much better at writing

1009
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:23,020
And that's why like the writing in those games is worlds better. So it does

1010
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,180
It was nano machines kind of thing. Yeah, it's clearly a george lucas thing

1011
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,260
He he got more control and as a result thing

1012
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,900
But like the biggest problems in five the biggest ones are that the game just isn't finished

1013
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,380
And I think those come down to konami issues with them not giving him the budget to finish the game

1014
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,620
It's deciding. You know what? We've spent enough money put it out the door. It's playable. That's it

1015
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:48,140
We don't we don't completely know and I think it's I think the danger with that game was that there were four

1016
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,700
Like I mean there were there were three amazing metal gear solid games and one pretty great one

1017
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,060
And then you know, you have no reason to expect it's not going to be great

1018
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,260
You have no there's no one that you notice has changed because the only name anyone knows is hideo kojima

1019
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:07,260
He plashes it all over everything. So everyone sees him as the guy the beginning of every mission guys

1020
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,460
Guess who made the game

1021
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:14,780
But like is he what a fucking guy was he the only one responsible for all these games being great?

1022
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:20,300
Or is it clear that he was not one of the guys or that there's more going on that we don't know and like yeah

1023
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,380
Even with the name recognition like

1024
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:28,380
Again, or whatever you shouldn't get you shouldn't just immediately be like. Oh my god. It's a kojima game

1025
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,820
It's gonna be amazing. It's well a lot of people work on those, you know

1026
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,180
I think we also have to go ahead whatever

1027
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,340
No, no you go. Oh well going back to hype. I think that uh

1028
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:43,980
I think that hype affected how the game was developed and designed

1029
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,300
negatively in a way because

1030
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,740
It reeks of that

1031
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:53,180
Philosophy of everything needs to be open world and appeal to everyone in the world and right that kind of thing and it's just

1032
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,900
That's just the game hype cycle and it's how all games are made now

1033
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,620
This is an all new thing to talk about is how hype will affect the development of the thing

1034
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:06,060
Which I think is has way more of a direct effect than how it affects my experience

1035
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,260
Okay, yeah, maybe for someone like you who says that it doesn't really affect him

1036
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,900
That's totally true because like look at look it's god

1037
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,740
It pisses me off so much that like the audience has now become part of the process of making the game

1038
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:24,860
It's like our reaction to these trailers like like street fighter 5 right too much ass on on cammy and uh on mika

1039
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:30,620
We got to get rid of that shit and like the the guys didn't intend that from the start or they would have made it that way

1040
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,620
They change things to and it's I don't know if that's you can like that or just like that

1041
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:39,500
That's just the audience it's the audience's response right, but I do think that like hype

1042
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:45,100
Creates the danger of every installment has to be better than the last and it makes people

1043
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,500
Like if you make something successful, then you always feel like you have to one up yourself and like

1044
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,860
It it kind of disgusts me because everyone

1045
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:59,260
Talks this way and I mean everyone even people who hate hype who say this and that like if you make a new game

1046
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,300
And it's not as good as your old game people are going to say so constantly

1047
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:11,660
All anyone's gonna like uh bastion versus transistor right like bastion came out and it was super hyped because like

1048
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,900
It was a you know game that nobody expected

1049
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:19,260
But it was really great and it had this great narration and everything and then transistor came out and all anyone talked about

1050
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,180
Was how it compares to bastion. Oh, it's right. It's it's kind of the same

1051
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,780
But it's not it's not quite as good the narrative isn't quite as interesting

1052
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:33,020
Listen that and it's like dude. It's a different game like forget about fucking bastion talk about fucking transistor

1053
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,100
You know like totally different art style different story different characters

1054
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,180
It's not a sequel in any way

1055
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:44,140
But like you know, that's what the hype cycle does to people is they always expect the next one to be better

1056
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,220
And to be this huge evolution. Yeah

1057
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:49,980
And what if it's just good, you know, like that's like the issue with something good

1058
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:56,140
Yeah, people aren't judging continuing works by if they're good or not because they kind of can't until the game comes out

1059
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,900
Uh, they're judging it by how how much it is is what they were hoping for in this series

1060
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,860
Well, I mean if you're reviewing a game, right you're reviewing a game

1061
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:11,980
Uh, to hopefully to someone who hasn't played it right the reader is someone who is perspective and like considering playing the game

1062
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,220
What is there to talk about like like hopefully I mean there's you got to talk about something

1063
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,940
They are familiar with and like relevantly that's going to be previous games by the same

1064
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:26,540
Right, but I think like I mean you got to compare it to something and that's like a pretty good starting point

1065
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,540
Saying it's one thing to say. Oh, it's kind of like bastion, but then to be like

1066
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,100
Oh, it's you know, it's like bastion, but it's not quite as good and it's like this and that and

1067
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,740
I just feel like it's divorcing it from being its own game

1068
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:45,180
And and I'm making it so the developer can never make anything that's not better than bastion, you know

1069
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:48,380
It's the same. It's we have a problem. I like the the w

1070
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Go on Gabe go on

1071
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,900
This is why I like the the w2 wtf series

1072
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:03,420
By total biscuit because when he talks about a game he does like at first impressions like a 30 minute video of and he just talks about

1073
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:11,180
What what he likes and how he feels that it you know, how good it is and it's just it's it's a nice introduction to

1074
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,980
like your own

1075
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:18,540
Research into that game because he talked about transistor and he didn't mention bastion

1076
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,140
And he talked about how cool all the things were and I was like, yeah, right, you know

1077
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,140
I I I didn't think it was my kind of game, but

1078
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:29,740
That's the sort of review that I prefer and I don't follow people that talk about things like

1079
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,220
Like if if somebody's going to compare two games from the same developer

1080
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,620
They better be making a video about the developer

1081
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,700
In general instead of just reviewing the game that just came out

1082
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:45,900
Well, there's times when it's appropriate and times when it's inappropriate. Yeah, devu was starting to bring up hiruki and maishi

1083
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,100
And I'm guessing you were going to talk about kill a kill versus guru in the gond

1084
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,220
Uh, yeah, of course

1085
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,740
Sure, like, you know guru in the gond came out and everyone thought it was the best anime ever

1086
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,140
And then when kill a kill came out all anyone talked about was how it compares to guru in the gond

1087
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,500
And you can't bring it for years. You could not bring up kill a kill

1088
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,380
Well, I guess it's only been out for it's been like two years two and a half years

1089
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:08,780
But like you could not mention it without someone saying guru in the gond was better

1090
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:12,540
And it's like it's who the fuck cares which it which it is which it is

1091
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,780
But I would say it is narrowly better

1092
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:21,100
But like I don't think it I don't think that matters like it doesn't it does not is no relevance to kill a kill

1093
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,780
What guru in the gond was other than the fact that it was made by the same people

1094
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:29,820
Do not agree that guru in the gond is necessarily better than kill a kill

1095
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:34,140
I think that you're clearly mistaken, but go ahead and make your case

1096
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,580
I think that you're a big giant faggot

1097
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,780
Well, what on what basis on what basis okay, I uh guru in the gond is better. I don't know

1098
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,740
I just like the uh dark souls tune. That's true

1099
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:51,660
Well, the fact that we're even arguing about this is missing the point the point is that it doesn't matter which one's better because they're completely different shows

1100
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:56,380
But I want to argue but it's kind of interesting but it's kind of interesting to talk about which one's better

1101
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:02,700
But like I think I just think that when that becomes all the conversation is then it's like why can't

1102
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,940
Emiishi just make another show and we judge it on its own merits and not worry about whether it is good

1103
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,500
I never bring up because it's an interesting question. It's an interesting question

1104
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,420
Which of these two big budget releases by the same producers is it is an interesting question?

1105
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,660
But it should not do it should not dominate all discussion of kill a kill

1106
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:27,180
Well, here's my only problem with this discussion is that I think it's vastly mistaken to consider either of them big budget

1107
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,500
Or from the same producer

1108
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:35,260
Listen, I think I do like the gond ligand kill a kill discussion more if it always involved

1109
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:39,100
Panty and stalking as well because that really completes the picture for me

1110
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:45,340
Right because that because I'm much more interested in Emiishi than the guy who wrote gond ligand kill a kill

1111
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,580
I really resonate with his

1112
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:52,700
Animation style. It feels like the thing that I want animation to be

1113
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,940
Since I was like born and saw animation

1114
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,260
Emiishi does the kind of animation that I want to exist

1115
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,660
It's a similar kind of resonance to toby fox where I feel like he comes from a similar place

1116
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:12,140
As me and that's why I mean if he comes out with another show that's going to be animated with him in charge or him directing

1117
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,540
I will be hyped for it

1118
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:22,940
Though not necessarily for whatever the narrative is and I'm almost certain I will enjoy it as a visual experience because I feel like I

1119
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,980
Understand where he's coming from

1120
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,140
Thank you for the creepy dramatic

1121
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:36,060
Downward I don't know why that was just that was a very it was it was your your way of speaking was hypnotic

1122
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,540
It was really quite hypnotic

1123
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:44,060
What do you what do you guys think are we are we hitting the limits of what we can say about hype and the hype?

1124
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,300
Well, we could talk about you think we could go forever

1125
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,620
No, we could talk I mean at this point we are talking about arguing over shows

1126
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,020
So, yeah, I don't know whether we have much to say

1127
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:57,340
Well, I think I think it all involves hype because I think that the I think you know again

1128
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:03,740
It's I think the problem with it is that people always want everything to constantly be amazing

1129
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,500
Everyone and people expect everything to constantly be amazing

1130
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:13,420
And I think that's the problem we're running into is that people aren't just like letting things cut like I think you should go in

1131
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,340
And just like let things come to you and then make a decision, right?

1132
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:21,740
Like sure you can know things about it beforehand and maybe set up like, you know

1133
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,660
If Kyoto animations making a show I'm going to expect the characters to look a certain way

1134
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,860
I'm going to expect the animation to look a certain way because I know that's what they do

1135
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,300
But like that doesn't mean it's going to be good or bad or whatever

1136
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,980
Like I'm just going to wait until it's there and then I'll look at it and I'll say

1137
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:41,500
That was good or that was bad. Like I'm not going into Kill La Kill thinking this better be better than girl in the

1138
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,660
Gone this better be as good as girl in the gone

1139
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:48,460
Like, you know, then you just set up this weird expectation that has nothing to do with the intentions of the show

1140
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:54,300
That I highly doubt anyone involved in Kill La Kill went into it saying we got a top girl in the gone

1141
01:12:54,380 --> 01:13:00,540
Hang on. I don't I don't I don't agree because I think it is fair to say I want this to be better than your past work

1142
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:05,340
It's not saying this should be like your past work in in all these ways only done better

1143
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,740
It should just be something that's it's I think it's reasonable

1144
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,100
I don't think it's unfair

1145
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:14,620
But I think it I think that it it's not like I think you're going in with your intentionality

1146
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:20,220
Not necessarily matching what the intentions of the series are and that can be fine in the long run

1147
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:26,620
But I feel like you should go in like like because hype is all about the beginning. It's not about what you feel in the long run

1148
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,220
It's about what you feel going into it

1149
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,700
And I think when you go into a show like Kill La Kill thinking this better be as good as girl in the gone

1150
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:36,780
Or else I'm going to be disappointed then you're setting yourself up for disappointment

1151
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:40,540
Whereas if you watch kill and you just enjoy it and then you go well

1152
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,140
I didn't like it as much as girl in the gone

1153
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:46,300
But it was a good time then like you know like that should be something you think about after the fact

1154
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,020
That should be like the I agree that it's reductive

1155
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:55,500
I agree that it's reductive and kind of nonsensical to go in with the expectation that something will be better than something because like

1156
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:00,620
How can anything be better? How can anything be definitively better than something like okay?

1157
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,820
I mean, this is just my opinion

1158
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:07,180
But something like girl in the gun which was basically perfect at what it did like right any like

1159
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:11,820
If something could be better than it in a certain way like if like something could be better at making you cry

1160
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:16,060
Then girl in the gun because girl in the gun didn't do that. But like you have no soul

1161
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,780
But but like um, maybe uh, I don't know

1162
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:25,580
You told me you teared up when comedy didn't show up in the opening of the next episode. You know what you're right

1163
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:30,460
You're right. It actually did make me cry. But other than I mean, it reaches its own top

1164
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:35,100
Right doesn't need to be done better. And you know, yeah, or even just as well

1165
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:40,060
Yeah, when comedy didn't when comedy didn't show up in the opening video. I think that like when he was gone

1166
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:45,820
Like, you know, I'm a big proponent of like I think that all things I think all art can be compared

1167
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,660
And I think you can select scores based on like I can look at girl in the gun and I can say that's a 10

1168
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:57,260
And I can look at kill a kill and say that's a 9.75. That's what I would score both of them on my current scale

1169
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:03,660
You know and like I can look at them and I can say that but like that to me should be after the fact

1170
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,220
It should not be going in thinking this better be as good as girl in the gun

1171
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,540
You know, it should be a consideration you make later like when you're I think I think

1172
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,540
You should start judging art after you've seen the art, you know

1173
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:21,500
Not like beforehand with the hype and like oh, this is going to be amazing or this is going to be terrible

1174
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,580
This is going to be the best thing ever and then like you watch it and then you you select

1175
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:32,060
It's like you're you're deciding how the game or the the anime or whatever compares to your hype

1176
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:37,980
Instead of just looking at it and then making a decision about it. That's why hype is a destructive force and needs to go

1177
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,420
I mean, I think that I mean, I believe in a holistic grading system

1178
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:45,340
Like yeah, I believe that you can more or less assign a score and a value to something

1179
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:50,140
But I don't think there's any good comes out of going in with like a rigid scoring system

1180
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,780
Like oh so many points for this category so many points for that

1181
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,700
It's all about just like

1182
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:00,380
Once you've watched it and you're done and you're there and the aftermath thinking about it like how did you feel watching it?

1183
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,460
What feeling did it leave you with?

1184
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,940
Afterwards I and you know but on the one hand

1185
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:09,900
I think that hype does affect that because if you went in with really high expectations and it didn't meet them

1186
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,980
Then it could leave you with that sour feeling. Yeah, I score things based on the amount by the level of enjoyment that I have

1187
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,420
Anything that I give a 10 is something that like I'm stewing over it

1188
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:24,220
Well after the fact and like this it's just so good like I can yeah, but a lot of people's enjoyment is affected by

1189
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,180
Randomly like see a kill lock kill picture and be like oh, yeah, and then all of a sudden I like spend an hour

1190
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:35,500
Check off immediately and and just looking at fan art and just dwelling on checking in it and how good it is

1191
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,900
Just constantly checking your and that's the kind of thing I gave a 10

1192
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:43,260
And I recently made a list of all the games I have played that I can remember and I gave them scores if I could

1193
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,780
and

1194
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:51,020
You know undertale ended up being the only one at this moment that I gave a 10 to I gave dark souls a 9.9

1195
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,900
Uh and but the fact that distinction though, what an asshole

1196
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,260
The fact that I gave throw it a fucking bone

1197
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,420
The fact that I gave undertale a 10 the fact that it's the highest scored one

1198
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,300
Isn't nearly as interesting

1199
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:13,100
As the fact that I gave so many 9s and the fact that there could be so many different games that could be a 9 to me

1200
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,500
So many different ways of video game

1201
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,060
Yeah, I think there's a 10 is vastly more interesting than what

1202
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,300
That I had like is a 10 out of 10 because I hate nuance

1203
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:29,180
Yeah, I feel like I feel like a lot of ten or zero. That's it. I feel like for a lot of viewers of stuff

1204
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,180
There's like a like a zero some game. It's like everything's either a fucking 10

1205
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:39,020
A six or four, you know, like those are the only or not even a six. I should say a seven

1206
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:44,460
Everything's a 10 seven or four, right? It's all I've gone on record is saying that's how I view most things

1207
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:50,300
Right, it's like either a 10. It's either the best thing ever or it's mediocre or it's shit

1208
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:56,060
And like and and those are the three scores people would use to denote those because nobody cares about the other part of their

1209
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,740
Fucking 10 scale, you know

1210
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,460
But like I I I'm with devu that I like the nuance of like, you know

1211
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:09,100
Not everything has to try to be a 10 a nine is also really interesting, you know

1212
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:14,300
Hang on. What what is this? What is this you keep bringing up about how a show shouldn't try to be great?

1213
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:20,940
No, I'm not saying it shouldn't try to be great. I'm saying I think anything above a seven is great

1214
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:25,340
I think if you make a show that's an eight out of ten that gives me tons of stuff

1215
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,860
And I think like, you know, if even if kill a kill is like

1216
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,540
Even if you thought kill a kill was an eight and you thought guru on the gun was a 10

1217
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,860
That's still incredibly impressive that it's an eight because to be an eight

1218
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:40,540
It has to be better than 80 percent of everything else out there, you know

1219
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,340
Like it's still something that has so much value

1220
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:49,900
And it's in the parts of it that it has and I think that value is so much more interesting than why it's not a 10

1221
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:54,060
You know, like like the things when you're like when you're like, oh guru on the gun is a 10

1222
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,380
Because this is in this and kill a kill is not quite as good and it's like, yeah, that's fine and all but like

1223
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,900
Look at all the stuff that is in kill a kill. That's all all great

1224
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,500
And I think like it's so reductive to be like well, it's not as good as guru on the gun

1225
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,940
So I don't care, you know, like I'm I'm with you on the idea that you should

1226
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:15,420
I'm with you on the idea that you should appreciate what is good in kill a kill and just think about what is there in kill a kill to appreciate

1227
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:19,020
I think that's cool. However, if guru on the gun like fucking

1228
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:24,620
Emotionally like did something crazy to you and left you with an impression that lasted for years and years as it did me

1229
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:31,580
And kill a kill didn't do that as is the case for me. Then I think it's worth asking. Okay. Well, why did that happen for?

1230
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,780
Yeah, I mean, of course, that's one question you ask. I think that's worth asking

1231
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,020
But I think it's I think that when we talk

1232
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:45,740
The answer may simply be because you're older and you already felt that with guru on the gun a million years ago

1233
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,020
There is that there is that I don't know. I don't think it

1234
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,580
I don't think kill a kill that would have done quite the same thing

1235
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,060
Well, I don't think it has the same intentions in the first place

1236
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,380
So I don't think it would have done the same thing for you but like

1237
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,060
But you know, I just think but that kind of I think the danger again

1238
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,740
I think the danger with that again

1239
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,820
I think it's cool to do that after the fact

1240
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,140
After watching girl in the gun after watching kill a kill deciding how you feel and then being like

1241
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,620
Kind of interesting that I didn't like that one as much as that one

1242
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,020
But again, I think the problem because this is about hype was what this podcast is about is going in

1243
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,780
thinking

1244
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:21,980
This better be as good as girl in the gun or constantly comparing it or thinking about why it's not as good or why it's better

1245
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:26,620
You know a bad place to be and on that note. I feel like we've

1246
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,260
Said our piece. Yeah, let's wrap it up. Sorry. Anybody failing so much. I don't know

1247
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:35,500
I got so busy. Hey, don't worry about it. Davoo. Stop me. Let me just end

1248
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:41,420
Let me just end on the note that I want to say that we've talked a lot about people over hyping things in their mind

1249
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,980
I think that my problem is the opposite. I really think that my

1250
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:53,260
Hype problem is that I underhype everything and I'm skeptical of everything and I really believe that everything will suck

1251
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:57,260
Until I see it and improve and otherwise and on the one hand

1252
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:03,420
This does lead to me being more often pleasantly surprised when I do see something and it's not as bad as I think and it's actually pretty good

1253
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:04,700
I'm like, oh, it's pretty good

1254
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:10,860
But it also causes me not to seek out media and I don't watch as many movies or listen to as many music or play as many games

1255
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:15,740
I probably should and probably would enjoy if I know what actually I just remember sometimes hype is good

1256
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,220
I just remember another thing about hype that can be good

1257
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,580
um

1258
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,580
Because best guy ever here

1259
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,620
Names his channel best guy ever

1260
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,380
And all of his videos best anime ever best game ever

1261
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:33,660
And I think that I think your channel would immediately be the worst channel on youtube

1262
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,540
If you ever failed to live up to the hype of your video titles

1263
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:40,700
It's it's hyperbole. Give me a break. Look. Okay. The thing is

1264
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,460
Because I hate that I I usually hate that persona. I hate when people like say i'm the best ever

1265
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,860
I think it's unless you don't even do that because the second you don't live up to it. It's well

1266
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:56,140
It's in your name. It's inherent you've named yourself best guy ever and the second you don't live up to it

1267
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,140
It's gonna look like a farce and you know

1268
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:01,340
I I took that that girl in the gone video the first one part one

1269
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,060
Yeah, I posted it up and uh, you know my friend ghost lightning who also like me and him

1270
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,860
We used to always talk about how much we hated like that kind of persona and like I post on twitter

1271
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:14,140
Like the best guy ever just made the best video ever, you know, he started watching it

1272
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:19,260
And he was like I thought it was gonna be shit because of the the the title and everything and the way you started

1273
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,300
But then of course it's a bait and switch it turns out to be like awesome

1274
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:27,500
You know when you watch it like you deliberately made it start off shitty and then it becomes amazing, you know

1275
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:32,220
Right, which was and if you look in my I don't know that's in the other video too at the end

1276
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:37,820
Like I took I took painstaking ever to take as faggy a picture of myself as was possible

1277
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,820
Right to show what an asshole I really am and then I hope people get that

1278
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:47,500
But like what I what I love about it though is that the hype what it's done for you as a creator is you have to

1279
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:53,820
Live up to best guy ever every time you cannot make a video that doesn't live up to your title

1280
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,380
I mean you can make some I suppose I'm open to more criticism for that reason. I suppose that's true

1281
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:05,100
I don't know about that. I mean, I think that what saves guys best guy ever persona is that there's a little bit of tongue in cheekness there

1282
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,220
It's like kind of a good

1283
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:10,060
It's like kind of a healthy mix of like serious hype like I am the best person

1284
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:16,060
Yeah, but I'm also kind of I think you can figure that out in the videos when he sort of like reveals that he's a nerd

1285
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:20,940
You know, but like and yeah, he doesn't play up the persona nearly as much as a lot of other people would

1286
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:25,900
But I do think that if you name yourself best guy ever and I watch one of your videos

1287
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,820
And I'm not interested immediately then it's going to be a bad time

1288
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:37,820
But if some of the comedy of the video comes from him sort of poking fun at himself

1289
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,140
And sort of like pulling the rug out from under his own

1290
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,420
Okay, if you clicked on his video though

1291
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:48,780
If you clicked on a best guy ever video and you didn't know who he was and you saw the name best guy ever and you clicked on it

1292
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,780
And it was not an amazing video

1293
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:54,780
Would you not then be deeply mad that he named himself? I'd probably be a little no

1294
01:23:55,100 --> 01:24:00,460
Not not if the comedy of the video came at the expense of the supposed best I guess I can agree

1295
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,060
But like I think that

1296
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,060
I that would make it not a bad video

1297
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:10,060
Like I think that I think that you're already like if the fact that that's happening already makes it

1298
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,180
A good video

1299
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:16,060
I'm saying if the video was not good if it didn't have that and the guy was called best guy ever

1300
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:21,580
Would you not then be that much more mad like if someone made it if someone made a video and they're called best guy ever

1301
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,980
And they started out the video like I'm amazing

1302
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:28,060
I'm the coolest and then their analysis was completely like not interesting

1303
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:33,820
Would you not be that much more mad that he called himself that I'm really interested in and I really want to talk about this

1304
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:39,340
It's the how a creator can manage the hype levels of their stuff and that's very interesting to me

1305
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,180
I know we were trying to end this podcast

1306
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:45,100
But that is its own interesting topic that I like to do in my own videos when I did my

1307
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:49,740
Willa Cooster tycoon one versus three video was this huge production and I'm like

1308
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,260
I don't want people to get hyped up to think I'm always going to be this big

1309
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:56,780
So right afterwards I did a two minute video about trampolines

1310
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:02,140
And later on I was doing this I did this 20 minute critique of big hero six

1311
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,220
I did this 35 minute break down

1312
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,540
You did these things not because you super

1313
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,100
Wanted to talk about these topics immediately

1314
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:15,100
But as a as an effect to bring down the expectations of the audience. Yeah, and I was making I made a well

1315
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,100
That's part of it. Like I made a 20 minute video

1316
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,700
I made a 35 minute video. So then I made a seven minute video

1317
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:26,700
And so like my idea is to like to kind of dress people down from their high

1318
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:32,460
Like sometimes that's a pretty good idea if I'm really into like really intricate really deep music

1319
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:40,300
And I'm on this big kick. I'll like listen to some really stupid mucor stuff that like lowers my class

1320
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,540
Brings me back. I I kind of do this

1321
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,860
Mucor is not low class

1322
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:50,940
I I do the same thing as devu where I try to manage expectations a lot and like especially when I first started doing anime videos

1323
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:55,900
Like I tried to get out as many videos as possible so that people would get like

1324
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:01,820
Like I didn't want people to think that I'm only into this type of show or that like if I only talked about sci-fi shows

1325
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,820
I didn't want people to think I was a sci-fi channel

1326
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,660
I didn't want people to think I was like, you know only gonna make big videos or small videos

1327
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,660
So I tried to mix it up and have like every video

1328
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,300
I did be something different from the last and make it like, you know

1329
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,940
And now I'm at a point where I can do anything

1330
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,940
I could just make nothing but big videos

1331
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:21,820
But people would know that I could change it, you know, like people wouldn't expect it to all be that

1332
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:26,860
Whereas I think like I think mr. Plinkett videos for instance because he set the bar

1333
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:31,740
Said they were always going to be big and I think that's why there haven't been anymore because like always

1334
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,500
Beg them for Plinkett videos. That's what people really want a couple of smaller ones

1335
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,180
But no one like, you know, everyone complained about yeah because they were small

1336
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,900
And so like he could never make Plinkett a video series

1337
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,780
I could do everything because so many of them were big so early

1338
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:48,220
But even with stuff like Plinkett like managing expectations

1339
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,060
Happens in the script where like he'd used that voice

1340
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:57,500
Specifically because it was boring to listen to someone talk about that kind of shit and it's just too nerdy

1341
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:01,020
So he wanted to make it something that you would expect like you go in and you're like

1342
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,780
What the hell is this, you know, and then it's like then you pay more attention to the points

1343
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,980
Which is why you know like film crit hulk does his all caps thing

1344
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,580
Which I don't think is as effective

1345
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:14,780
But like I get that he's doing it so that people think it's stupid and then they read it and they don't think it's pretentious

1346
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,220
You know, I don't think it works when I do it. I make a video about undertale

1347
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:23,660
I'm going to tell everyone to rip it off and then everyone took it literally and then mr. Beetsong like

1348
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:29,740
Is the expert of this where he always like he'll he'll he'll like the biggest difference between like the truth is

1349
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,780
I'm engaging in calculated sophistry for the sake of

1350
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,780
The difference between Beetsong and and errant signal, for instance

1351
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,020
Is errant signal will pull out some huge word out of his ass and just run with it

1352
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,060
And you're just like what the fuck are you talking about where Beetsong will be like

1353
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:48,380
I'm about to make up a really stupid word and I'm a complete idiot

1354
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,340
Here it is. If you're interested then keep watching, you know, like he downplays

1355
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,660
What he's doing so that you don't think

1356
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:59,340
While this pretentious fuck like you do when you watch errant signal videos, you know

1357
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,940
If I were in toby fox's position because I I wish I have even

1358
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:08,620
Like named him on twitter with the at symbol to like hope he reads this because this is my advice to him

1359
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:13,260
Because he has probably enough money to live for a couple of years without publishing anything for sale

1360
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
Make a bunch of really short

1361
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:19,980
Little games about random things that are off the top of your head

1362
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:26,460
That way people who are fans of you can think of you not as the undertale god, but as

1363
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,020
This guy who comes out with shit

1364
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:34,700
You know, I don't think there's any way of avoiding him being undertale man for the duration

1365
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,780
I like that idea to do. I think that's a good advice

1366
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:41,500
It was greatly diminish it would give him this fan base of people who follow his stuff

1367
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,580
Not when will be the second coming of toby, right?

1368
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:50,380
Because that way when it's time like say in three years to make his next big game

1369
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:55,820
It'll cost especially if it does take three years because by then people will will have like, you know

1370
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,820
Any time I think the I think people build up in their heads when something doesn't come out for a long time

1371
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:08,700
It automatically means that all the time was dedicated to it, you know, like for instance, uh, the band agilosh

1372
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:15,340
Agilosh only puts out an album every four years and like their first four albums were all like incredible

1373
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,820
So it always felt like man, they really ruminate on this stuff for four fucking years

1374
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,540
And then they put out their fifth album and it was kind of like mediocre

1375
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:27,100
And it was like, you know, the the first impression you get is did they really spend four years on this?

1376
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:32,300
But then you think about it and it's probably more like they were just doing normal shit for three years and then decided

1377
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,580
They wanted to do like I don't think that they're professional musicians

1378
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:40,940
Like I don't think they have enough fans that or put out enough content that they get paid just for that

1379
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:44,540
It's probably a side job. They probably have normal fucking jobs, you know

1380
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:46,380
So like yeah

1381
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,580
So I can't help but imagine that it's really more like every four years they go

1382
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:53,340
Hey, what if we put out another album? That would be fun, you know, but like to the fans

1383
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:57,180
It's like, oh my god four years of waiting has finally paid off

1384
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:03,580
You know, this this has to live up to those four years of expectations and you know, and then you get middle year solid five and

1385
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:09,740
Yeah, what a what a disaster which was like what like eight years seven years something like

1386
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:15,100
Well, well, wait years hands are on came out in that time too. So that's you know, there was something there

1387
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:21,980
Yeah, red line. Well red line was awesome and red line wasn't even was red was were people super hyped

1388
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:27,740
No, no one knew and no one watched it once it came out. It was totally later on like it was completely

1389
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:32,300
Did not sell no one cared about it and madhouse went bankrupt and

1390
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:37,980
Okay, but but I guess at least it's become kind of a cult hit now, right?

1391
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:40,940
I guess you can call it but I still don't think it's as big as it should be

1392
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:47,660
It's actually it's on youtube now for free. Anyone can watch it. Yeah, like uh fucking. Oh, shit

1393
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:52,300
Maybe I should go buy it on dvd. Yeah, dude the dvds lately. I've been lately

1394
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,020
I've been really feeling the urge to buy things that I like I went back and I bought I bought a

1395
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:02,380
Highlyx that claymation game because it was only three dollars and I thought he deserved three dollars

1396
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:06,460
I went and bought lisa for a friend because I really wanted to spend more than the three dollars

1397
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:11,500
I spent have you come into some great wealth that is prompted such uh such kindness

1398
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,700
Medline blue rays were seven dollars within like a year

1399
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:20,140
Like they immediately were on sale like one dollar for each year that it was there

1400
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:24,620
You know, let's look talk about talk about not having hype when I saw a red line

1401
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:30,060
I didn't know what the fuck was gonna happen. It was like the best movie I've ever seen. It was so fucking good

1402
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:33,420
I'm so glad that we've all hyped the shit out of red line

1403
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:37,100
Everyone listening should go watch it with totally high expectations

1404
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
Expect it to be the greatest movie ever

1405
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:44,860
Which incidentally if you go one of those expectations, you will be let down because the plot is not that interesting

1406
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,460
It's just a really cool movie

1407
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:51,980
It's it's but that that comes right back to the problem with like managing hype

1408
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:56,780
We're like it's so hard to talk about red line because your instinct to talk about it is

1409
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,940
It's so mind-blowing that you're like this is the greatest thing ever

1410
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,940
But then you actually watch it without hyping it. I don't think it's anyone's favorite movie

1411
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,700
But it's something that I think everyone should see and I think that's a problem

1412
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:12,540
When you say something like everyone should see this movie then they're like, oh, it must be the best ever

1413
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:17,020
And it's like well, it doesn't like the bestness is not what makes it worthwhile

1414
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:21,420
It's the intrigue of seeing that this is real that like this is the thing that happened

1415
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:25,420
You know, it's fascinated on like a cultural level that it exists that was produced

1416
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:30,780
That's too to go to go back to the thing about how I underhyped things in my head

1417
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,300
And how

1418
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:36,780
A having hype is bad and it makes me like things less and going back to undertale too

1419
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:43,260
Let me draw all these threads and please wrap it up this time to go. I gotta and tell the story if I played the demo

1420
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,460
I loved the demo. I was like, I'm really excited for this game

1421
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:53,340
But due to my proclivities in my head. I'm like, okay, that demo was really good. He probably used all his good ideas for the demo

1422
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:57,900
The rest. Yeah, the rest of the game will probably not be as consistently good

1423
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:02,300
So I actually kind of dehyped myself for the rest of the game didn't expect to like as much

1424
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,820
Then went in

1425
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,820
Found that the game continued to get better and better and all had all these other great ideas in it

1426
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:12,140
And ended up being like, hmm, you know what? It actually was pretty consistent in quality

1427
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,780
It didn't it didn't blow me away. It wasn't better than the demo

1428
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:18,220
But it was all I'd say all of it was consistently as good as the demo

1429
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:22,860
So my expectations and the reality ended up it ended up being like a very

1430
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:28,060
Fortuitous like they came into alignment in a way that it all really fucking worked out just just beachy for me

1431
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,820
So that was a very rare case. That's the thing. That's didn't end up

1432
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,820
But it was because

1433
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:38,140
But it was because I was managing my expectations in that way because of my skepticism

1434
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,620
The hype didn't end up hurting. Well, that's good. Okay

1435
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:44,700
Good anecdotes. Everyone. Good talk. We're done. Oh
