00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,680
Hello everyone, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast for another exciting week!

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:25,500
We got me, Ben Saint, we got Digi, we got Gibbontake, and we got our special guest this week is

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:34,140
Mer Logic, who you might know as Wonder Bread Guy, the guy who makes the pictures, who commissions

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,980
the all the pictures of blonde women with Wonder Bread doing deforestation.

5
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,820
Eleazar, pause the video and play, show a cascade of those images going across the screen

6
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,900
Kevin MacLeod tracks.

7
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,020
Man, y'all are so lucky this isn't Twitch, cause we've already been copyright clammed

8
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,940
by now because of how their fucking guidelines have been as of the past couple of days.

9
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,460
Like, what do you mean?

10
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,100
Like just for mentioning songs?

11
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,940
Just any music in general gets the DMCA fucking raging like you wouldn't believe.

12
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,580
That's true.

13
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,300
So Mer Logic, I have to ask you immediately.

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,620
Have you ever commissioned cosplay girls to do live, do you have any interest in live

15
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,180
action photographs of girls with bread?

16
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,420
Here's the story, I have my own Tumblr page, not my own personal Tumblr page, I'm talking

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,820
about a page where somebody thought it'd be funny to make a Tumblr page dedicated to

18
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,940
round references to my shitposting, and I found that Tumblr page by accident, and when

19
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,380
I was scrolling through what was in this Tumblr page, somewhere at the very bottom, there

20
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,500
was a picture of a girl who was looking for a Halloween costume because she was trying

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,100
to go and she thought, and I've even personally talked to this person, she thought it'd be

22
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,700
funny if I were to draw myself as one of Mer's commissions and then go to the party and then

23
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,380
have them wonder just what the fuck I'm supposed to be.

24
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,700
So she dressed up like one of my commissions and then went to that party and then wrote

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,100
a post about how she went to the party, they had no idea who the fuck she was supposed

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,700
to be, and when she posted that on Reddit, everybody was like, what have you done?

27
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,820
Why are you trying to, why are you trying to awake the quote unquote ancient one because

28
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,700
they act like I'm some kind of demon that only fucking summons itself if you get the

29
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,300
right summoning salt and you make it in the right single shape, so I wouldn't talk to

30
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,180
this girl, and she was like, yeah, I came up with the idea just on a whim, it was the

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,340
only Halloween costume I could think of to make, I'm a little surprised you were able

32
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,780
to find it, I mean, yeah, you're directly referencing me, how the hell would I not find

33
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
it?

34
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Wait, so you didn't ask her to do it, she did it as a joke.

35
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,420
She came up with this idea on her own, she went to the party dressing, yeah.

36
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,500
So they were right, she did summon you with this arcane ritual.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,020
It was ridiculous, but yes, I haven't personally paid someone to cosplay for me, but I have

38
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,780
had people dress as my commissions.

39
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,940
That's the way to do it, you just get your reputation to buy your own way and you don't

40
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,700
have to pay for shit, yeah.

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,540
Okay, people's heads rent free.

42
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,460
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,020
So what you do, if I'm understanding correctly, is you have commissioned various artists

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,180
to draw, I don't know.

45
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,260
I want to ballpark, how many artists do you think you've commissioned total?

46
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,020
Wait, I was going to let you know this guy.

47
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,100
I know, I've heard and seen a few of the images, but I'm not entirely sure as to what

48
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
the deal is.

49
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Maybe we should make scale.

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Is it a scale?

51
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
It's a scale that is impressive.

52
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
No.

53
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Actually legitimate.

54
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
I've seen...

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
Are you interested in this thing?

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,940
I've seen many of them in this thing.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,300
Which is cool, that's epic.

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,540
Can you explain the appeal briefly?

59
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,060
But does our audience know?

60
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,020
Is our audience going to be completely lost if we don't?

61
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,540
They will probably have no fucking idea.

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't think most of our audience will know anything about Murlocic, so...

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,540
I mean, I briefly said what his deal is.

64
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,700
I don't know, he's known far and wide for...

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,060
Eleazar, show another cascade of these images going across the screen, set to a kiss from

66
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
a rose.

67
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,220
I mean, the images themselves may be famous, but I've heard him talk about what...

68
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,260
I have heard you talk about what is the appeal.

69
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,020
I am interested in you talking about it again, if you could explain to these guys.

70
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,140
That's the question that's the obvious question as far as I'm concerned.

71
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,380
When someone is confronted with your uvra, with your body of work, it's like, what is

72
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,980
the animating force behind this?

73
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,220
So I have a copypasta written about this.

74
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,620
I don't know if one of you wants to read it to get like a broader idea.

75
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Sure.

76
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
I'll read it.

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,660
Should I just post it in general chat?

78
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Yeah.

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
Yeah, go for it.

80
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Sure.

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,060
I went and copy pasted this while we were in the middle of the recording process of

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
someone...

83
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
Oh, Christ.

84
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Yes, so if someone wants to read that...

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Wait, wait, wait.

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
You wrote this?

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Yes.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Okay.

89
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,500
And it's close to blonde girl voice as I can.

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,620
Wait, why don't you read it, Murr?

91
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
Because I've read this...

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,620
I want to do it.

93
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,220
I tried to read this on the fucking The Dick Show, but I couldn't read it.

94
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
The Dick Show.

95
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
He wouldn't let him read it.

96
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Yeah.

97
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Okay.

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
All right.

99
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,780
It's a parallel on how normally society identifies negative stereotypes, but they only ever stereotype

100
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,980
it in a way that fits their narrative.

101
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,540
Let me explain it like this.

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,100
How often do you watch cartoons or animation of any variety where they decide to do an episode

103
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,700
where the theme of the episode is about spreading either an environmental message or they create

104
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,180
a character for the sole purpose of helping to spread an environmental message?

105
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,900
When people, animators, slash writers, whatever, feel the need to make plots like this, their

106
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,220
archetype of choice on how they write the episode is, let's draw a white, tall, shady-looking,

107
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,860
sometimes fat, really depends upon how cartoonish the show in question is, billionaire, one-dimensional

108
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,540
character who doesn't care or think about the long-term consequences for his actions

109
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,420
because as long as it continues to make money, he doesn't give a shit.

110
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,940
They've been making this one type of character in the industry for years.

111
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,260
I am so sick of seeing characters like this, not because it's a bad character type, but

112
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,020
because it's demonized to where people start to think, man, why would they even draw a

113
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,860
female equivalent to a character like this?

114
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,260
It just doesn't exist.

115
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,660
And yeah, it's hard how in the real world you need to really think about it if such a

116
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,660
character like this could ever exist in the real world, which is probably why it is so

117
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,020
easy to make a character like they have been making for what feels like forever now in

118
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,340
the cartoon world because that one character can represent.

119
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,020
Either one type of character that fits that narrative or a whole group of people that

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
could fit that narrative.

121
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,060
I'm just saying, we live in a world where a female equivalent to this character I am

122
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,500
describing is very rarely seen, so I wanted to bring more attention to this fact by making

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
more of them.

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:40,140
So what I'm getting out of this is like more female, evil, billionaires, Yasqueen, representation.

125
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,460
Before I got my dream gate art nuked, I had an instance where you've all seen that one

126
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Tumblr post, that one Tumblr user going thermonuclear, that one infamous post that everyone knows

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
before.

128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,060
I'm not sure if I do or not, to be honest, but go on.

129
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,220
It's the one where it goes like part of me believes.

130
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,940
It doesn't ring a bell, can we show it on screen?

131
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
I don't know.

132
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
All right, so there is a Tumblr user.

133
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm not going to tell her your name because everybody can probably just look her up on

134
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,740
her own, but this Tumblr user, she's a commission artist, and here's the thing, I ask hundreds

135
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:30,060
upon hundreds upon thousands of commission artists by the hour every day, so eventually

136
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,100
after a while I tend to just forget how many people I ask commissions for, and I'm guessing

137
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,220
at one point she just kind of fell into that circle of people, and she got so asravaged

138
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,740
beyond all fucking comprehension that I asked her very generically if she could draw me

139
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,460
commissions that she went on to this fucking, you know, typical Tumblr shit show of rants

140
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,660
that everybody is ran, everybody knows before, and to take it a step further, she went on

141
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,460
my DeviantArt, and she complained about how she didn't like the art that was on my DeviantArt,

142
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,820
but here's the thing, the reason why she hated all of the art on my DeviantArt wasn't

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,060
because of the one thing I thought it'd be, because if you're a Tumblr user who's absolutely

144
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,580
fucking obsessed with wanting to push women empowerment, you're going to look at my art

145
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,300
and think, oh my god, look at all this sexist content, I'm so disgusted, my purits and eyes

146
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,260
can't handle it, no, that wasn't why she was angry, you want to know why she was angry?

147
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,020
and I shoot you now, this is a direct quote from her, I don't like any of Mer's art because

148
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:47,260
all of the characters are white, okay, they're what, oh, I think if I were to change nothing,

149
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,340
have everything be the same, but all of the characters were any other demographic other

150
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:01,180
than white, perfectly fine, it was a kind of empowering image, but no, would they be happy

151
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:09,340
so we need more women of color deforesting the Amazon rainforest, what I'm thinking is,

152
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,100
like would they be happy if it was an all black picture, like do they specifically want it to

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,460
be diverse, like is it only a problem because they're white? you know what this sounds like to

154
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,220
me is that this person was upset for reasons they couldn't understand and like they just

155
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,420
tried to think and they had to like reverse engineer their own upsetness, that sounds like

156
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,540
Tumblr, yeah, like what is it, what is it that bothers me, what is it that bothers me, uh white,

157
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:45,500
okay, yeah, what you should like when I look at the the the collage of art and it's it's fascinating

158
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,540
to me that there is so much like consistency and through line in the tonality of them between all

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:57,100
these different artists, but like it's it's like it's so specific that when I see it I think well

160
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,340
obviously this is something that one person cares about more than anything in the universe

161
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,340
and having heard you talk about it that is absolutely true, so like I think that's why

162
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,460
people are fascinated with it is that like I don't know I wish I had that single-minded

163
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,700
devotion to anything, you know, you would think if they were any other demographic other than

164
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:25,660
white it would be worse because anybody who's ever watched 12 years of slave or django or that one

165
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,900
episode of the boondocks you would think black women looking like how they were as like fucking

166
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,020
home masters from like the civil war era they would think that'd be even worse but not you got

167
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:44,060
this one tumblr user it's like why the fuck are they all white this is terrible it is problematic

168
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,700
it makes that really okay okay but like these these characters they're like they're villains

169
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,780
like you're you're depicting them as as the villain right yes so this yeah okay this is the one

170
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm probably keep having with tumblr is that tumblr can differentiate the difference between what is

171
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,020
reality and what is not reality this is a fictional picture it can't be real but they treat it like

172
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:16,140
it's real and then react like real which is ridiculous yeah sure I'm curious Mer like do you

173
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,540
want it to be real like if they're really what okay so you would not want to date a crazy blonde

174
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,380
shit cutting down trees without with a hang on I didn't say that I said I didn't want to be real

175
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:35,580
okay for real I'd be open to the idea however what makes this so compelling is the fact that it's

176
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:43,260
not real I'm like yeah I think I understand of Ricardo Lopez I like things that are not real

177
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,700
versus Ricardo Lopez being the guy who wanted something to be real so badly he went to great

178
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,940
extremes to make it real and for people who don't heard Ricardo Lopez okay Ricardo Lopez was the

179
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,420
Bjork stalker he was the man who tried to fucking put an AIDS bomb in the mail and try to send it

180
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:08,700
to Bjork okay okay okay okay so it's not it's not like you actually like wish for the destruction

181
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:17,180
of forests but yeah yeah but something I really feel like I'm on the same wavelength I get it with

182
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:26,780
this sort of stuff because I am also I'm also like a great lover of the terrible evil bitch lady

183
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:34,060
characters in a lot of media she's most enticing you know anybody who's ever like golden boy no

184
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:41,660
man madame president makes my cock so hard it's oh golden boy I love golden boy my best friend he

185
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,580
fucking loves that he keeps telling me to get that to watch it I haven't watched it yet but I know who

186
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,700
madame president is because that's his wife I watch golden boy when I think I was probably a little

187
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,140
too young to appreciate it uh all I got out of it was that the main character was like the coolest

188
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,700
guy ever it's almost like embarrassing how he's like oh wow he's so cool he can literally do anything

189
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,940
he's like oh what a what a badass uh uh but yeah yeah yeah you're simped because you got that scene

190
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:13,580
where madame president just spits in his mouth super erect he's he's he's like he's like a horny

191
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,540
idiot but he's like he like there's only six episodes I think but like every episode ends with

192
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,380
him like pulling turning the situation around in some like unbelievably like ridiculous display of

193
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,940
competence like there's I think there's an episode where he gets hired by some like software firm

194
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,380
and then like everyone like the the the the madame president or whatever of the software firm like

195
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,140
abuses him and shit and then he like he runs away in the middle of the night but before he leaves

196
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,940
he spends like one night and he like reprograms their entire database and like overhauls all

197
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,940
their like computer like company software and shit and just like remakes it from scratch

198
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,580
and it's just the best fucking software anyone's ever seen uh there's another bit in that one

199
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,740
episode where he pretends like he's playing on a computer so he draws a piece of paper that looks

200
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,820
like a keyboard and he's just furiously typing on that piece of paper he's like yes even when

201
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,340
you're not shitposting your need to shitpost consumes you so so you you were you were telling me

202
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:18,540
the other day or I was talking to um um wait uh uh okay I want to I want to give a shout out to uh to

207
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,780
wanted me to talk to this dude but but he was he was I was confused because I was because I was

208
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,420
talking to him and he described like like your commissions and stuff as shitposts and you're

209
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,460
describing them as shitposts I mean so I thought okay so it's a bit so it's a bit a lot of things

210
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,220
one it's porn two it's for shitposting and three it's for you know spreading my brand around you

211
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,380
know because I like to I like to make shitposting interesting you know we're we're at a point 2020

212
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,220
has made me realize that you know people who moderate all these big names social media sites

213
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,420
like reddit and fortune you know we call them the janitors because they do it for free you know

214
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,460
they're yeah we're all tired of shitposting they they don't like it they want everything to be like

215
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,500
in this contained little box where everything is no fun allowed and if there are any people

216
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,580
having fun at any time you're done you can't have any fun anywhere at any time that's why I've

217
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,020
been banned practically everywhere now the only places I haven't been banned from now are twitter

218
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,340
and discord and that's half the reason why I want to go back on the dick show because I want to feed

219
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,940
into dick's point about how we're becoming more and more Orwellian by the day because the US

220
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,780
government literally cannot fucking help themselves ever since shelter in place the government has

221
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,620
been forming a massive fucking stiffy in their pants finally getting to have their Orwellian

222
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:11,020
wet dream come true and they're so close but can you can you elaborate interrupting that it's pissing

223
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:18,380
them off can you can you elaborate on the Orwellian state all right so how about just the concept of

224
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,340
shadow banning in general like if you ban someone you know they can't go back for a couple of days

225
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,260
if you ip ban someone you're done like you know unless you have some ip like like altering software

226
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,740
like Nord VPN like you're essentially done but I'm guessing like hard crack down on ip banning

227
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:42,940
they have shadow banning now where they'll give you the freedom to keep shitposting but the problem is

228
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,540
only you can see nobody sees it that only only you can see it but that's but that's not the government

229
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,860
oh hear me out there's a point to this so yeah what makes shadow banning really shitty is that

230
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,700
you go through all that shitposting and nobody can see it and you're thinking yourself is like

231
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,660
how the hell do we get to this have any of you ever heard of a guy named mr. anti bully mediocre

232
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:15,900
medicare yeah i know i know who that is so before medicare basically just disappeared off the face

233
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,660
of the internet he got cancer yeah he got cancer like he basically just moved out of existence so

234
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:31,500
he made a video and he was talking about how a lot of dumb shit has happened since the 2016

235
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,300
elections obviously or at least to the perception of everybody a person that the establishment

236
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,660
wanted to win did not win and they were dumbfounded as to how this happened so they had to call a

237
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,860
spade a spade and kind of alter things accordingly now during this process mediocre goes and releases

238
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:59,420
this video and he's talking about how google and all these big tech companies are very upset

239
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,740
that the narrative that they want is not the narrative that they're getting or have gotten

240
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,100
close to getting because people keep shifting away from their perspectives and their points of

241
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,380
you want they can't control people unless they control the narrative so medicare goes and says

242
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,780
they're hoarding you what they're doing is that they're going to work all these people who are

243
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,260
experiencing wrong thing and they're going to put them in a box and they're going to put them in a

244
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,020
box where the only people who can hear them are the people who are in that box or even worse the only

245
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,580
people who can hear them are themselves and an example of that would be poll poll is a great

246
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,100
alternate place to find people who can give you alternate means to look for news that isn't

247
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:51,100
completely biased like cnn or msnbc or all of these circumstances where the situation

248
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,260
the question seems very sketch and questionable and all the material given doesn't look like it's

249
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,460
legitimate it looks like it's being altered and twisted to form a narrative and he warns all these

250
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,380
people it's like eventually it's going to get to the point where the establishment is going to get

251
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,020
so sick of people shitposting and saying anything that people don't like that they're going to

252
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,980
rope them all into a box and then keep them into that quarantine area and they can have all the

253
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,740
wrong thing they want as long as it's not being put in the place that we don't want wrong thing to

254
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,820
think shadow banning is a normalization of that you notice how because i'll mention tumblr again

255
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,660
i mean i definitely think that twitter in particular is a like an extremely managed

256
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,180
like platform in terms of the narrative that the that the platform itself is trying to push

257
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:44,300
based on who pays them which seems to be like the more democratic leaning side of the

258
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,180
media establishment just based on the fact that when you make new twitter accounts like

259
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,700
all the stuff it pushes to you is just like like the the catalog of all the you know the

260
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,420
ellen and all the famous people the that weird category of the people who get pushed by the

261
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,780
media you know what i'm talking about yeah like uh the same people who are who youtube is always

262
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,820
showing in your face and um it's fascinating because it's not that there isn't a huge presence

263
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:21,660
of like the exact opposite opinions and everything going on on twitter but there is a like an effort

264
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:28,700
in the part of the algorithm to push the like a a i don't want to say left wing because it's like

265
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,500
what's the word i'm looking for just democrat i guess like it's just like push biden to president

266
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,820
currently is like what the like when you look at what the sidebar is on twitter it's like

267
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,780
it's it's not representative of what is being tweeted about it's representative of like what

268
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:51,020
twitter wants you to think is happening today you know i i mean sure is that i mean is that like

269
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,060
i don't know i for all i know twitter could be like a big like neoliberal chill or whatever could

270
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,260
be like all about biden maybe jack is like su just thinks like cop mommy cop malla is really

271
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,540
hot i don't fucking know um i think they just get money from there because like twitter twitter

272
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:12,060
doesn't make twitter makes no money like twitter doesn't they keep increasing the amount of ad

273
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,340
shit on there and now they're doing fleets to i don't know get people to use it more i don't

274
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,980
know how that even pushes ads but like the like twitter was making like less and less money year

275
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:31,180
after year and i have to assume that it's more powerful as for its ability to inform or like

276
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,260
create narratives in society like so much of what is taken very seriously on twitter as like

277
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,260
things happening that matter a whole lot don't seem to really when you actually go outside and

278
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,100
like look at what's happening sometimes you know i mean like of course like i mean the huge swaths

279
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,700
of twitter are owned by like bts stands and and and stuff like that like yeah of course everything

280
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,220
that's important on twitter isn't important in the real world most things on the internet don't

281
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,780
matter in the right but a lot of it looks like it does things are super important on twitter for

282
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,340
like one day and then everyone forgets about them but they they affect the way that people yeah

283
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,340
they affect people's like the way that people compound their narrative about their personal

284
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:20,940
politics you know like i think that i think it is being used like the the idea of like putting

285
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,540
some of like obviously twitter doesn't want to kick republicans off of its platform that would be

286
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,940
preposterous that would be a lot of the population but it's it's not that they're like even necessarily

287
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,340
suppressing them or making it impossible for them to communicate with each other or link or anything

288
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,500
like that like if i follow a bunch of accounts of one type i'm going to get recommended everybody

289
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,860
who those people follow because it's based on who they follow not based on what they say or what they

290
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:56,060
do but twitter does shadow categorize you like they there's you know proof of this idea that like

291
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,860
they have all these tags that they put on like users or posts who have been flagged for like

292
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,980
saying certain things and like they do put you in boxes they do try to like if they identify you

293
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,860
as somebody who they don't want to have their voice out there right and it's not even that it's a

294
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,220
right versus left thing it's just whatever twitter wants the their whatever they're in service of

295
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,860
i don't know who's at the heart of i mean that's i'm sure that i'm sure this is true i'm sure that's

296
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,860
true this is um this is just this is what happens when uh when a company when a company has a monopoly

297
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,340
on a certain kind of information yeah of course they're gonna use that that's a great yo uh ben

298
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,220
yeah let me add to your point there when you mentioned how a company is using money to enforce

299
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,820
that agenda do you remember a while ago when basically the entire world had like the biggest

300
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,460
thermonuclear shit that possible because somebody some fucking pageete or whatever working at the

301
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,540
white house was pushing for that means or um you know just it doesn't really matter just some

302
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:07,500
fucker who wanted to push the fc or not the fcc the uh the net neutrality thing and people were

303
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,100
complaining non-stop about how they were worried with this net neutrality bill that the internet was

304
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:22,860
going to focus more on biting by the whims of what corporations want versus what the natural user would

305
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,060
want like there were all these like reports about people talking about how like if you want to go on

306
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,860
a site that the internet doesn't want you to see like you know they'll let you go on it but they'll

307
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,700
make it a pain in the ass for you to one find the site in the algorithm and two like it'll take way

308
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,180
too long for you to actually get on the site versus how it's yeah i remember about net i remember

309
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,020
the thing about net neutrality yeah that's basically what you're talking about they were trying to make

310
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,500
it seem like you know unless you're like a billionaire or you have like a lot of money to spend

311
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,340
on like ads and all that shit they were going to make the internet more convenient for them and

312
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,580
inconvenient for everybody else you know because they can't financially compete with that that's

313
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,980
namely what you're talking about yeah well yeah i mean but yeah the goal was to make it possible

314
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,500
for for uh you know certain certain groups and individuals certain companies to you know further

315
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,540
monopolize the internet because because right because net neutrality right now means that

316
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,860
everyone that uses i'm not an expert but my understanding is that it means that everybody

317
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,820
gets access to the same bandwidth versus if we remove net neutrality then like twitter or

318
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,780
facebook or whatever couldn't could basically buy access to the good internet and everyone else would

319
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:38,380
be left with you know the the scraps of bandwidth that were left over nothing vile how could anybody

320
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,660
fucking not see that as like just man just let me have my orwellian wet dream i'm about to

321
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,900
i'm so sick of edging i want it now i want to be like china it's obviously it's obviously bad

322
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,620
and evil but because but because politics are controlled by money and money to interests you

323
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,580
know it can still make it to the highest court in the land or whatever obviously i'm not saying

324
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,420
people with power like well they've they've lied in their bed they know what they want they they

325
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:11,100
know what they're doing mm-hmm and it's it's fucking awful i hate it so much sure sure um

326
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,660
okay i don't even remember what the question was that let us down this this this avenue

327
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,460
i've been looking at pacifika northwest she's one of my favorites who pacifika northwest

328
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:29,100
from gravity falls the one of two characters that i remember oh yeah yeah yeah oh right blonde

329
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:37,820
sure okay cool i i like these images they're they they they speak to me i think like that

330
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,940
you were saying it was a shitpost but it was also kind of a real thing i think the quantity

331
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,380
of it is the shitpost like the fact that you've done so many of them

332
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,460
and all of them were made by me like it it was like the opposite of like when wendy got popular

333
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,060
as a character and like way in like a fucking boatload of like ad traffic because people kept

334
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,820
drawing porn of their mascot and they couldn't have been happier because people were going to

335
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:09,740
wendy's more often oh oh i think you went wendy from um gravity falls no no no yeah okay i knew

336
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:15,420
what he meant um when wait okay i just want to can you how how long have you been doing this

337
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,740
how many images do you think you've commissioned how many like how many do you do in a month like

338
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,420
how much do you and how much have you spent on this versus like how much do you spend in a month

339
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,900
well then i should specify the fetish itself started when i was three years old but the

340
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:35,180
commission started around 2012 can you tell us about how the fetish started so uh one of you

341
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,420
has been on the the dick show so you already know this story but for the sake of repeating it

342
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,060
yeah for our audience's benefit when when i went on the dick show i was talking about how um i was

343
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:52,460
watching uh dexter's laboratory one day and an episode showed up and it was basically the start

344
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:59,660
of how my uh destruction fetish essentially came to be um so the episode was called the old

345
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,020
switcher rooms it's about how dexter's dad came back from a bowling tournament he got first prize

346
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,220
for being the best bowler out of everybody there and when didi and dexter are running around in the

347
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,860
hallway you know just being stupid kids they knock over the trophy and they break the trophy

348
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:21,500
and dexter's dad gets really really mad instead of crap i do remember this yeah instead of uh

349
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,900
instead of grounding both his kids he turns them it's like you know what i've got a more creative

350
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,780
idea for punishment since you both broke my trophy dexter you're gonna be spending the rest of the

351
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,900
night in didi's room and didi you're gonna be spending the rest of the night in dexter's room

352
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,060
and dexter if you leave didi's room at all anytime throughout the night you're sleeping in the dog

353
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:51,100
house and the dog is gonna go sleep in your room so what the so dexter is who would sleep in didi's

354
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,900
room that would mean that if wait that would mean that if didi can somehow get dexter to leave

355
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,100
her room then the dog goes to dexter's room and by default didi would go back to her room so i

356
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,860
could see mind games developing out of this so i would think i would think that dexter would

357
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,780
rather have the dog in the lab the didi who he thinks is going to destroy it absolutely well

358
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,820
not not the lab his room because you the there's secret access to the lab but i don't didi might

359
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,180
know how to access the lab from his room in fact and she definitely does which book it is to open up

360
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,540
the the fucking bookshelf but dexter's sitting in didi's room he's having a panic attack he's

361
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,500
envisioning like all the horrible things didi could be doing to his fucking lab right now

362
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,940
and anytime he hears a strange noise he presumes that it's didi destroying his lab in the other

363
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,940
room like he hears like a fucking clock going in didi's room and he just presumes did's didi

364
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,340
like taking a sledgehammer and just destroying everything inside because there's like nothing

365
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,340
stopping her from just wrecking everything but these little mental hypotheticals that dexter

366
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,820
is having like all the horrible things didi's probably do into his lab that's how it started

367
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:08,540
i just got so uncomfortably aroused at how this horrific trail of three i just like oh yeah i've

368
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:15,180
impressed by your ability to recognize arousal at age three yep that's how it started i i don't i

369
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:22,300
don't get it but what what i guess why should i expect to um okay yeah okay so all right so then

370
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,620
maybe it's too much to put it in for me i feel like he's he's been spending too much time at

371
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,820
catholic school it's like oh the world is covered in skin right now i don't understand what's hot

372
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,900
about his thoughts that someone is breaking your shit and you know is it like the powerlessness

373
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:45,900
it's i think right oh it's the someone else is is like taking over like um so would you describe

374
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,140
the entire world is like it's just a massive but in a strange way like the winds get crossed

375
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,660
and scary things become really and holding in quiet missionary for the purpose of procreation

376
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,540
i don't understand what you're describing is not like filthy it's just it's just baffling

377
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,860
very logic would you consider the same would you consider this a masochistic fetish on your

378
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:15,420
part yes definitely okay okay sure like as i can i can recognize the world to be destroyed

379
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:23,580
seeing the world be destroyed by hot ladies like oh oh no but also i get it i get it so if it's

380
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,700
deforestation it's like it's it's not just it's not like just your shit that's it's our it's our

381
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,980
it's all of humanity's shit being destroyed it's like she's all of humanity out of what should be

382
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,820
our ours natural resources try to explain this is like does he just have a fetish for karen's

383
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:47,660
and i laughed for like five minutes when someone recommended that i i think i think a part of it

384
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:57,180
is so as as speaking as a masochist um like it's part of the you know you it's like you

385
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,300
like like you said well given said like there's a helplessness aspect right like you want to be

386
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:10,780
like in a position of um i have i don't have to have control in of the situation because it's

387
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:18,620
i can't you know um and so like as a as a woman it's very easy to achieve this by just having

388
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:26,300
a man who's bigger than you you know like hold you down but like as a guy how does a woman have

389
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,820
any kind of like power over you like she can't you know unless she's stronger than you

390
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,700
she cannot physically overpower you which is you know most women are not stronger than most men

391
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,420
but they can dominate your wallet and fuck up your life by like spending all your money and

392
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:55,660
fucking um destroying the world all the trees yeah okay where does this make sense to you

393
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,700
does this seem like it could be accurate in any way as i'm nervous i can feel him depleting

394
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,620
an energy i understand do you think the um do you think the wonderbread aspect is also like a

395
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:12,060
like a power dynamic because it's like oh mom goes and gets the wonderbread when she's shopping

396
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,180
and like you're almost on target but there's actually another story in relation to that and

397
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,780
i don't know if anybody's heard this unless you've been on the dick show and more than happy to

398
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,260
share that story with you yeah please so you know if ben isn't had a stroke right now he might after

399
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:36,220
this you you are miss you are mischaracterizing me very much right now but go go on all right so

400
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:45,180
a long time ago when i was say around 18 i was looking for my first job and i had no

401
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:52,460
resume experience whatsoever um i went over to a place called pedaluma people services center

402
00:34:52,460 --> 00:35:00,060
all the way up in pedaluma and uh the organization that i'm talking about is kind of like one half

403
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:07,180
psychiatric place one half uh unemployment office so i went over there and nice it's a good

404
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:14,620
combo it helps people learn about their feelings and then get back up on their feet and um over

405
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,100
there and i'm asking my therapist it's like yo i really need to get a job i need to start making

406
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,980
some money and um she recommended me this place called bounty farm which is located right next to

407
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:34,140
the luckiest in the police station up in pedaluma so i had to get up at five o'clock every day and i

408
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,140
had to fucking get on a city bus and then take that city bus to the bus stop and then go from the bus

409
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:47,260
stop to the county bus and then take that county bus all the way to pedaluma and i had to then be

410
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:53,180
there by eight o'clock every day and i had to do this for three years it was exhausting but it was

411
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:00,860
my first job i'm working on a farm how old how old were you how old were you 18 okay yeah so i'm

412
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:07,100
there and right now as of then i was the only person working there and i go to my boss i'm like

413
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,180
am i the only employee working here it's like not the only employee we're gonna be getting another

414
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,140
employee you also showed up the day after you did she'll be showing up soon so she shows up

415
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,780
and we get to talking and after a while this person ended up becoming my girlfriend and it

416
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,700
didn't last but the process wasn't like just instantaneous boom you're my girlfriend now

417
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:34,620
it was a long long long process you know like anybody who's ever watched like any of those

418
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:42,060
really shitty soapy opera kind of shows like 90210 or and any of any of those kind of shows like

419
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,300
you know it was the build to that you know it's like we had to we had to have a long lasting

420
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,900
friendship a bunch of dumb shit involving other relationship shit had to happen and eventually

421
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,260
she just turned to me and she was like you want a shot like you want to be my boyfriend see what

422
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:03,980
it's like i'm like i'm more than willing to try and we were in a relationship well i should say we

423
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:11,340
were in a friendship for years but our actual relationship serious relationship lasted two

424
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:20,460
days and it was two days of my life that two days felt like two years so that's the funniest

425
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,580
shit i ever heard yeah so we're we're going on our first date and i have this all planned out

426
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,460
first we're gonna go get uh chinese food so we went to this old place that doesn't exist anymore

427
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,340
called gary chews and we go there and that's is that like is that like a sonichu like uh

428
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,060
original character obviously christian came out to win her up it's like may i recommend the

429
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:52,460
gary chew yeah so we go to gary chews and it's already not going the way i wanted to go she's

430
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,460
talking about how she wants to get drunk and i'm like it's like one o'clock in the afternoon

431
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,780
you're talking about wanting to get blitzed so were you guys even old enough to drink i'm i wasn't

432
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:12,460
old enough to drink but like she was 21 when i met her so i mean she's 21 so i see we go to gary

433
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:19,180
chews we have our food she wants to drink and then i then skip to the next part of the date which is

434
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:25,500
where we went to go see a movie we went to go see this is making me want to drink so we go to the

435
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,260
movie theater we see mad max fury road and after we're done with the movie she oh great movie oh great

436
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:40,380
great film classic film yeah so after the movie is done she wants to go home and she really wants

437
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:50,700
to drink so we get on the bus and we're going on our way home and here's the problem before this

438
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,540
i actually met a person i used to live with and i'm not gonna obviously give this man name because

439
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,100
you know i'm not an asshole but just to really give you an idea as to what this person was like

440
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:07,900
i found him drunk in like the bus stop one day and apparently he had mid-court order or whatever

441
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,820

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:35,740

446
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,780

447
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:46,380
date started i ran into this guy i used to live with okay i think this guy for three years because

448
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:52,620
i used to be a foster kid we used to live in a foster home together he i i want to nail down

449
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:58,380
the order of events so this is the day before she became your girlfriend he said i fucked that girl

450
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,380
yeah the day before she became my girlfriend this dude i lived with all my life and the

451
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,940
foster home that we lived in turned to me said i fucked your girlfriend so yes we're on the

452
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,340
bus right home and then and then the next day you were like hey she was like hey be my boyfriend

453
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,340
and you were like okay let's go out and get chinese yeah so okay on the bus right home yeah i know i

454
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:23,660
know what you're thinking you know i i don't know what i'm thinking i'm not sure but before we get to

455
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,380
that she was like no it's not cocked you that's okay okay go on go on we're on the bus we're on our

456
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,740
way to runner park which is where she lived at the time she doesn't live in runner park anymore

457
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,780
because it's too expensive to live there but when she was living in runner park we're both on the bus

458
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:46,460
i turned to her and i asked her did you fuck that guy and she gets really defensive about it

459
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:52,140
and she said no i did not fuck that guy but then after like 10 minutes of silence she gets really

460
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,540
embarrassed she turns to me and said yeah fuck that guy the day before i asked if you wanted to be

461
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,860
my boyfriend we went and had sex and i just told him to leave so wow okay so he was telling me the

462
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:11,260
whole truth yeah she admitted to it and this is where it gets really depressing really fast so

463
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,820
when we get off the bus the first thing we do is we go into safeway and she buys two 12 packs of

464
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:25,820
IPA log and eat a beer and if any of you have ever drank an IPA it is the shittiest beer ever you

465
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:33,420
know is it i don't know if that's i think that's a controversial opinion IPA's are a a new gate

466
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,500
for sure they're they're sort of like uh it's like the dark souls of beer the dark souls of beer you

467
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:45,900
know i no i drink fucking miller light i drink i drink fucking natty ice like i drink like piss

468
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:54,940
beer and i don't give a fuck natty ice you might as well yeah no yeah i i do i'll drink the worst

469
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,620
beer in the world i don't care but okay sure you get all the IPA and we're going back to her apartment

470
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,380
and i'm thinking to myself it's like man you know this is not going the way i hope it do but i'm

471
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,900
hoping at the end of the night we can somehow fix this so we go there she cracks open an IPA and

472
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,140
she cracks open another IPA for me and then she throws it over to me and wants me to start drinking

473
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,500
let me ask you how did you feel when she said yes i fucked that guy were you mad did you feel

474
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,420
sad were you jealous complex assortment of different emotions between what the fuck and why

475
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:34,300
so yeah she passes me an IPA and i take one sip and i immediately spit it out i'm like this tastes

476
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:43,340
horrible how do you drink this so two of her friends show up and they come on in girls

477
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,420
no uh well one of them was a girl one of them was a boy these are just people that she knew

478
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:57,740
and uh yeah one of them pulls out a deck of cards against humanity cards and no no

479
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:06,140
no oh this is the worst part so i'm sitting down at a table and the good times are over

480
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,140
she's flipping out cards against humanity cards like they're fucking poker cards and i

481
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,700
just fucking shoot me yeah so let me tell you cards against humanity is the most

482
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,180
overrated game i've ever played in my life i feel like the only reason why this game exists

483
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:29,340
is because if you're really politically correct like i'm talking really politically correct like

484
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,420
the very idea of anybody even like hinting at saying the n-word pisses you off the only reason

485
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,420
why they play this game is because they can have one instance where they don't have to be politically

486
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,900
correct but it's i have a yeah but it's the only time ever you get to feel that way and when you

487
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:52,780
take that away this game sucks this game is boring it's i don't know why people think this is the

488
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:59,180
greatest game in the world the the jokes the jokes in in cards against humanity or have already

489
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:04,860
you're not making jokes when you combine cards like the designers made those cards and made those

490
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,980
with those combinations in mind already like you're not even like being creative you're just

491
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,380
like matching things that like the designers put there because they thought it would be funny

492
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,740
this is the first time i've ever played cards against humanity and when i finally get the

493
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,540
bare basics down the first thing that goes into my mind is that's it this is all we're doing yeah

494
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:28,220
who fucking care about a game like this people just want to say naughty words it's the only

495
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:33,340
reason why they're playing this game yeah yeah yeah and ridiculous like there's no enjoyment out of

496
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,220
this game again even though what little enjoyment you can get out of this game it's boring i'd rather

497
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,940
be doing literally anything else right now other than playing cards against humanity so she's passing

498
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,100
out IPAs she's flipping out these cards against humanity cards after like 10 minutes of this i'm

499
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:55,420
like i don't want to play anymore like my date is already ruined i couldn't like you know i just

500
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,860
wanted to go out to get chinese food i wanted to go out and see a movie and i just wanted to have a

501
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,060
quiet night with her i instead have her complaining about how she wants to go get drunk and then when

502
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,460
she leaves the movie she wants to go get really drunk go to see if we can get a bunch of things to

503
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:18,380
help her get drunk we go to her house and you know her eventually her friends just finally leave but

504
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:28,380
like you know go in and her room has one futon now this is not like a king-size alaskan bed no

505
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,060
it's like a regular futon it's like the kind of futon you see in those slice of life japanese

506
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:40,460
anime's where it's an apartment for one you sleep on a futon this is what you sleep on this futon was

507
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:48,620
very clearly made for her body type because it perfectly fits how proportional she is to the

508
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:59,660
so she goes and gets a small tube tv and a dvd player and what she does is she grabs a random

509
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:07,020
movie off of her dvd case and the movie she grabs is howl's moving castle and she puts

510
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,620
howl's moving castle in the dvd player and starts playing the movie now you've heard of netflix and

511
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:22,300
chill right i assume that's what we're trying to yeah we don't have netflix so in order to stimulate

512
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,740
netflix and chill she grabbed the dvd put it in and just put it on his ambient noise that's just

513
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:34,940
what we did before netflix like you know it was move movie and chill yeah so she pops in howl's

514
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:42,860
moving castle which is her favorite movie next to princess mononoke so yeah so she puts this

515
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:50,460
movie in and she wants to have me cuddle her on the futon since i mentioned before that this

516
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:59,420
futon is clearly only made for one person imagine my fat fucking frame pushing this scrawny girl

517
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:06,620
off of her futon so i am like back first against the wall like in a lying down form i'm almost like

518
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,220
in a fetal position and my back is essentially touching the wall because i want to have her have

519
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:19,420
enough room on her futon so we can cuddle but if i eat up too much room for what i think is like

520
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:26,060
proportional for me i'll end up pushing her off the bed so it's impossible for this to be

521
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,860
any less romantic if it tried so she's like all right we're we're gonna make this work

522
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:43,980
follow me the best you can and i want you to you know touch my breasts and i did right so

523
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:51,260
of course this was the first yeah this was the first time ever describe the can situation

524
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:58,940
what oh sure tits like did they feel like wonder bread is this where this has been

525
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,340
leading this is where the story is the entire time all this build up i touched this is the

526
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,100
worst story i've ever heard about this this is even this is even this is even worse than jesse's

527
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,020
how i lost my virginity story this was the longest the most pointless story i've ever heard the funny

528
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:18,540
thing is i knew what the ending was at the start and i just wanted to see how long the story could

529
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,700
possibly go and if i hate this relevant to the i hate it all for the first time this is the first

530
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:30,620
time ever i touched a woman's breasts they felt really soft and i'm thinking to myself what is the

531
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,700
only thing i could think of that would represent what a woman's breasts feel like i'm thinking i'm

532
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,060
thinking i'm thinking and the only thing that possibly why were you why were you thinking about

533
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:46,140
that just touch the the boob yeah i touched breasts before i'm thinking what am i thinking of when i

534
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:52,380
think of this texture bread it's it's it's the uh this is why this is why you got dumped this is

535
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,580
why you got dumped do you think too much did you say that out loud you say oh you you have a very

536
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:04,140
like bread like breast no i didn't say that to her but i thought about it after she told me to leave

537
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:13,260
the following day so okay i want okay okay so you touched the boobs and was that it no there is

538
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:21,420
more to that but it's a bit more nsfw and uh so did you so did you fuck uh so before that

539
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:28,940
just yes or no just yes or no did you fuck or not we did well but it wasn't like the way you

540
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,380
thought like she wrote a list and on that list was things that she said she would be open to

541
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:40,060
doing i think she wouldn't be open to doing when i asked her when i asked her all right what's your

542
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,060
opinion of giving someone a bj and her opinion of that was you only ever give bj's to people if

543
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,420
they do something rewarding like they got a promotion at work they got an a plus that's

544
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:56,620
horseshit yeah but that's how it's your opinion of anal and she's like no i hate it only catholic

545
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:03,900
schoolgirls do that shit it's painful i got her okay okay so okay all right i asked her all right

546
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,140
so she's like touch my breasts and i touch your breasts and they feel like wonder bread

547
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:15,340
then she's like all right let's try kissing i really enjoyed this part but the problem is

548
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,900
again like touching someone's breasts i've never kissed before so our tongues our tongues are touching

549
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,780
and then after like 10 seconds she pushed him back it's like have you never kissed anyone other

550
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:33,980
than your mother before i'm like no this girl seems like kind of a bitch so um yeah for real

551
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,420
so she gets up and she's like all right i need to be perfectly real with you

552
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:44,780
i've done this so many times with multitude of different men so i just kind of know right now

553
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:52,780
are you a virgin i'm like you're my first and she just turned her face against the wall she

554
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,940
lied down and she was quiet for the rest of the night i woke up at six in the morning she told

555
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:06,140
me to leave yeah so you didn't see you didn't fuck you said you fucked you didn't fuck it started

556
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:13,660
that way okay go on then what happened next she woke me up at six and she told me to leave

557
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,820
you said you fucked yeah you said you fucked yeah we did when when when in that story did you

558
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:25,660
fuck right in the middle of the kissing part were you not paying attention no i wasn't paying attention

559
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:32,620
i don't whole story okay i guess i okay i guess i missed that part okay you like fuck we made a

560
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,820
long way wait so you how did i miss it you must have skipped over it in like no time at all

561
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:44,940
you you asked me this story about where does the bread come from i told you that's how it started

562
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,860
my first sexual encounter am i crazy did he just like completely gloss over the part where they had sex

563
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:57,740
i don't remember you describing that you had sex remember you saying that's not important that's

564
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,580
not that's what i asked i wanted to know if you fuck yeah we did but that's not important you're

565
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:10,940
overthinking it the point of this story is where it started all right okay that's fair enough

566
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,020
okay so you how long how long ago was that and then she realized that you know they they

567
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,340
fucked while they were kissing i think yes there you go now you're getting it but all right

568
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,740
like you you all act like you know it's like a long process it's not a long process it's different

569
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:37,980
for each person okay um mirlog how long ago was this that you made this wonderbread discovery

570
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,860
six years ago but like that was only when i wanted to start making commissions of it i've had this

571
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:48,460
fetish since i was three years old wait stop well not the wait not the wonder you said the

572
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:54,060
wonderbread thing happened when this when you were 18 yes but it's not just wonderbread it's

573
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:00,540
wonderbread deforestation and destruction this fetish happened when i was three it only started

574
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:06,460
okay into what you see now when i started making commissions okay well i guess i guess what i'm

575
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,740
trying to understand is how long after discovering that boobs feel like wonderbread did you start

576
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:20,620
commissioning art of wonderbread specifically that's six years but six years between those two things

577
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:27,980
yeah so i broke up with my girlfriend and i learned that boobs kind of feel like wonderbread and that

578
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,900
was kind of what started the whole commissioning process so no but okay but how long after that

579
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:41,020
happened did you did you commission your first work of art oh after that oh yeah first after

580
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,980
i broke up with my girlfriend okay so it's pretty much immediate like had you already been like

581
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:51,500
regularly commissioning artwork before that yeah i was regularly commissioning artwork but it was

582
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,420
unrelated to wonderbread what was it it was deforestation and destruction i assume

583
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:05,500
i i'm okay okay so i understand the destruction happened three years old dexter's lab wonderbread

584
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:11,500
18 years old girlfriend uh when when did when did specifically the deforestation aspect

585
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,940
no i just asked that you know the destruction and deforestation aspect is in the same category

586
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:22,780
that's been that way okay three isn't it okay wait okay okay but but but the example you said the

587
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,420
dexter's laboratory didn't involve deforestation yeah i feel like like that must have come into it

588
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,940
at a certain point you must have made a jump you there must have been a moment when you made a jump

589
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,820
from oh i like this destruction thing that this oh deforestation is like a particular instance

590
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,060
of that that is particularly compelling and then it moved on to captain planet and then it moved on

591
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,580
to a number of different shows uh i reference guys every part of my life so you would say it spread

592
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:51,740
would you say that it spread like wildfire through your uh enjoyment of media now you see the

593
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:57,980
most really bushfire of like 2020 was just a metaphor of what really happened this episode of

594
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:03,740
dexter's lab was like a lightning bolt that lit the dry brush underneath the dehydrated bog the

595
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,860
peat bogs of something i don't know what is the most you spent on one commission of this

596
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,540
let's see i think of it varies upon artist artists and it varies upon the scale of the project

597
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,420
i once paid 323 dollars for porn of another commission artist's wife

598
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:32,140
excellent worth it that's funny base um how much okay ballpark me how much have you spent

599
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:39,980
totally in this the intervening is like six years 4.3 billion dollars per million that's not a real

600
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,940
number my friend exactly because the number is so high i've lost count i guess the better question is

601
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,340
what is it in the four digits five digits it's in the seven digits big rush fortune digits

602
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:59,100
marologic at what rates would you say that you commission art for this like how often not nearly

603
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:04,140
to the degree that i would like to because like everybody else during shelter in place i am broke

604
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:10,220
and so are 50 million other people over the united states right right where do you where do you post

605
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:15,580
them like like i think you post them around as a shitpost where do you put them i did post

606
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,980
them on dvn art and then i got shadow banned and then i posted them on reddit and then i got shadow

607
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:25,020
banned and i post them on why did you why did you get shadow banned from dvn art because the janitor

608
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:31,020
is fucking do it for free and they shit their pants but don't get their way but but what was

609
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:36,220
but what was the jet okay i don't see anything bannable about just simply posting the images

610
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,500
that you have commissioned but homeboy you don't get it janitors don't do their job

611
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,860
because they want to do their job correctly because it's the only amount of power they get in their

612
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:53,020
life this is why people i guess yes i think the i think the question that's trying to ask is

613
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:58,940
where you ban for your uh for your image posting or for text posting like for things i want to

614
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:03,580
know specifically what was the thing that was like okay this guy's out of here it was both

615
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,820
i made fun of the janitor's waifus and their shit opinions and how they have no idea what the

616
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:13,420
fuck they're doing and they're unforeseen wait what you made fun of the you made fun of the mod's

617
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:26,060
wife no no i didn't make fun of their other wives they're waifus they're 2d images oh you're making

618
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:32,700
fun of the of a mod's waifu yeah and i don't know who who was wait who was it who was the waifu

619
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:39,020
who fucking cares there's probably some shit waifu i don't i'm just okay fine what did you say

620
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,900
tell me how the encounter went that just i did your waifu is shit you have the shittiest

621
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,260
taste in waifus ever hot pockets and asthma puffers you just cannot handle the bants when

622
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:56,860
you get blown the fuck out you cry and then shit your pants yeah and then you got banned yes

623
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,660
and it's basically the story how i get shadow banned on basically everywhere i'm banned on tumblr

624
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:08,140
reddit dvnart and specifically target mods that's why you get banned is that you

625
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,780
i'm not targeting mods on purpose they instigate this and then it leads to me getting banned

626
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,420
i'm not looking for mods they're looking for me that's the problem well now that you've

627
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,940
got a reputation i can kind of understand how they would at least find you so that make that part

628
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:35,020
makes sense fucking june it's good for free they do see i yeah i would i would be confused because

629
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:40,380
all of these images they're like a strange fetish and it's funny that there's so many of them but

630
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:45,020
like there's nothing offensive about them so like yeah it wouldn't it wouldn't be a reason for any

631
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,540
social media sites are getting to the point where they just want everything to be a echo chamber

632
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,980
hub box where everything is exactly they want it to be they want control they don't want fun

633
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:02,700
posture they don't want riveting discussion they want control you know it just occurred to me

634
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,140
i i just i don't know why this is something i never thought of there is definitely people who

635
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:15,580
would pay you to mod your stuff so so is it so is it the is it the companies that want control

636
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:20,300
and an echo chamber they're banning you or is it these like individual jannies that do it for free

637
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,820
that are just exercising their individual power it's a bigger symptom of what's wrong with the

638
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:31,420
internet right now everybody is getting banned for dumb reasons i'm not complaining because i'm the

639
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:36,780
only one getting banned i'm complaining about how just everywhere it's not even just a reddit it's

640
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:43,180
everywhere people are getting banned for the dumbest shit because janitors who do it for free

641
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:48,220
have this in their mind like they're enforcing this new agenda they're being told to enforce

642
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:53,020
or other people are just going off script because someone made fun of their waifu or something dumb

643
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:59,180
and they got so fucking asthmat they shot their pants they shot blood and they banned the person

644
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,180
and then he coomed in his pants and he thought he did something productive today that is the janitor

645
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:09,500
he does it for free gotcha very logic i have to tell you i think you're a marketing genius

646
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:16,220
the way you hammer on those phrases like that um they do it for free i think they would pay you

647
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:23,740
to mod for you i think that's imagine if i do get paid i would never i would no i'm not even

648
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:30,380
saying that they would get paid i'm saying i'm saying that janitors would pay to do the job

649
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,140
like they would pay oh to do it they would they would pay deviant art or discourse or whatever

650
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:41,420
yeah yeah to be a mod sure i'm sure i think there are people who would complain about being a mod

651
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,500
when that one girl who went on my deviant art complained about the art being all white

652
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,620
she went over to the deviant art mods and she was like don't you think this counts as hate speech

653
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:57,260
deviant art moderators probably okay okay we're in a sonico season diaper fetish shit

654
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:02,220
and then they look at my art it's like huh you're right now i'm i'm sure deviant art

655
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:09,100
always so i'm i'm here i think it's funny now obviously it's funny that she's like all i see is

656
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,140
white people this is hate speech like that's pretty funny but i i'm just curious if that incident

657
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:20,460
did you reflect on it at all and be like what if i did draw a black you know colonizer a black

658
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,340
deforester yeah what again what was your conclusion that is when i drew princess marco

659
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,300
from star versus who's the only not well technically that's not true i don't even know who that is

660
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:38,380
pretty long from star versus she's also princess marco princess marco star versus oh okay i see her

661
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,140
her okay her male that is the boy

662
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:51,980
that's mm-hmm yes it's princess oh marco marco d uh oh it's the oh it's the boy it's the

663
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:57,420
i've never seen star versus so i don't know who these people are okay all right gotcha gotcha

664
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:05,820
okay this is uh that's excellent so mere logic that that ties into uh something i was gonna ask you

665
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:11,420
is at the beginning i was asking if you'd ever paid anybody to like just cosplay and hold bread

666
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:16,940
and i happen to be planning to dye my hair blonde in about a week so i'm wondering do you would you

667
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:24,460
business opportunity did you just straight up just push bend to the side it's like all right

668
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:30,860
off camera real quick this is more like you know more important with me like a payment plan

669
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:40,060
i gotta i gotta be hard let's let's talk to make some money so i don't i don't even get to i

670
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:45,580
i'm going to be blonde anyways and i like eating wonder bread so i would have no problem procuring

671
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:51,740
that um and also this i mean you just introduced me to the fact that there's like a hard to procure

672
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:58,460
wonder bread in this economy you know it's funny i actually had someone on reddit sitting again

673
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,140
before i got banned and he was like hey i am a transitioning trap if i were to make a sandwich

674
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,100
and eat it would you pay me to eat it i'm like that depends how much you want to ask it's like

675
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,980
if you were to just like give me 10 bucks to like make a sandwich and eat it would you get

676
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:20,140
turned on and then pay me to do it i'm like hmm i don't know i mean would you do it and in the end

677
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:26,380
he didn't really do it but he instigated the idea he asked me it's like would i really well i'm

678
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:33,580
already dug deep into this hole so i might consider it dg probably write down notes right now

679
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:40,620
yeah i mean whenever you can afford to uh pay for me to cosplay just hit me up

680
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:53,820
name a price okay i mean i have to i guess i have to take other cosplay picks i have to

681
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:03,260
develop a portfolio first i guess um i don't really have a portfolio of uh cosplay photos

682
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:09,500
yeah we'll get there i mean i am an artist i would be up for drawing a funny fucking

683
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:15,340
deforestation wonderbread commission i could i could preferably because i can't afford any

684
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:23,020
i that's another half the reason why not not i'm i'm willing to wait i'll play the long game

685
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:27,660
i'm gonna be blonde for a while so this is gonna be waiting it's like any day now i'm gonna be

686
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:33,340
making bank if my investment opportunities is actually perfect i did want to ask you if it's

687
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:38,140
not too much information like how do you afford to pay for all this art like what would what were you

688
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,420
anywhere is able to afford anything right now i'm shelter in place i got one stimulus check

689
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:49,740
and you know it didn't last like or we're all like on some kind they gave us $1,200 and said

690
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,620
fuck you so did you did you lose your job were you non-essential worker i was already

691
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:59,420
in need before shelter in place now i'm like a super neat like during shelter in place like

692
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:05,500
everybody well how are okay well how are you making money as a neat like how how is it different

693
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:11,180
now than it was then why can you not afford it anymore many different and is you know if i have

694
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,380
money like i get it off like making tab money or i do like various odd jobs because if i need a

695
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:23,900
commission i'm willing to you know do anything need a commission tab tab money yeah you know

696
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:29,740
let's say somebody comes to me and they ask me it's like hey oh homie i need a pack of cigarettes

697
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,060
could you get me a pack of cigarettes and then i'll pay you back when i have money i have one guy

698
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,900
right now he owes me 110 bucks and if you were to look at his tab the only things that are on his

699
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:45,980
tab right now are and i quote pizza rolls pizza rolls chicken nuggets chicken nuggets hot cheetos

700
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:52,380
hot cheetos snapple snapple 110 why don't what why don't they just buy it at the store broke

701
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:58,140
they asked me to buy it for them and they pay me back oh wait so do they pay you back more than you

702
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,820
like are you sure do you charge interest um i haven't really implemented an interest tab because

703
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:08,620
i feel like if you implement interest it only compels people to not wait okay this this doesn't

704
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,860
make any sense how do you have this is not a this is not a money-making scheme no wait this is an

705
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:21,180
uroboros i'm confused how do you get the money that you spend that ends up on their tab so here's

706
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:27,580
the thing i'm not like christian where i'm spending money like it's out of style i have money i just don't

707
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,140
spend it like a retard like christ but where does it come from where does it come from just money

708
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:43,100
i've saved up saved from where i assume you just have a job i assume you had a job in a while i

709
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,860
sure don't have a job during shelter in place sure that's what i was saying you did have a job before

710
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:54,380
though had a job i've had multiple jobs i'm also you want unemployment since you lost your job due

711
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:00,380
commissions you should you should apply for unemployment if you lost your job due to the

712
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,180
covid release oh okay all right good i kind of have to everybody is right now like how else

713
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:10,540
you can afford yeah the government wants to be completely dependent on them right now i don't

714
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:15,020
know i have i have at least one friend who like lost their job it like couldn't work anymore because

715
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:20,860
of covid and they were like uh yeah well i guess i just have no money now and i'm like did you apply

716
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,100
for for unemployment you know they have a clause in the cares act that says like if you lost your

717
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,820
job due to covid you're entitled to free money from they're like uh i probably don't qualify

718
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,300
no i'm not going to do it i'm like you're literally just throwing thousands of dollars away

719
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,580
your friend probably just heard about the stimulus check thing i thought why doesn't the government

720
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:45,740
just on my door i just give me money i just wanted to personally give me money yeah i don't

721
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:51,100
maybe work of any kind yeah it's i i think probably yeah it's like they are intimidated

722
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,940
by the manner but like it's come on there's like there's like a whole bunch of money that is like

723
01:07:54,940 --> 01:08:00,300
for you you should just like put in the the paperwork to claim it and i know people are

724
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,940
complaining about how societal collapse will happen any day now but literally as of right now

725
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,740
the federal reserve is printing trillions of dollars in money but acting like giving people

726
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:14,300
a thousand dollars a month is like too much for them to benefit oh the economy can't handle it

727
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:23,020
you poor people yeah tighten your belt straps a bit more yeah hell yeah austerity boys uh no

taxes for the poor people to not work um were we talking about i don't remember okay i was just

733
01:08:54,940 --> 01:09:00,300
too busy thinking about how that other girl who just like cosplayed as a wonderbread girl

734
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:06,220
should have gotten like i can't believe she didn't think to ask to get paid i think did you wanted

735
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:11,900
to know before before shelter in place what did you do for work well the last job i had and this was

736
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,140
before shelter in place this is like a while i've been unemployed for a while i worked at a place

737
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:22,380
called uh buccaloo unemployment and uh there's a longer story in relation to that but like uh you

738
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:29,660
worked you worked at an unemployment firm so in my city there are two unemployment firms there is

739
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:35,820
department of economic rehabilitation and buccaloo they are the two biggest unemployment centers in

740
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:43,260
the city i needed a job so i went over to dr and i asked my new art coach what is and they gave you

741
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:49,100
a job at the other one so here's the thing i go over to her and i ask her is there anything i can do

742
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:55,180
to make some money real quick and she asked me it's like well there is uh catholic charities which is

743
01:09:55,180 --> 01:10:03,260
open catholic charities is a rehabilitation center for runaway kids foster kids and recovering

744
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:08,140
drug addicts they wanted me to go work over there but they didn't specify what the job was about

745
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:14,060
over at catholic charities but in order for me to go get that job i had to be trained first so

746
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:20,860
they send me over to buccaloo and i go over to buccaloo and i'm going through the inauguration

747
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:27,020
process and the woman is looking over my resume and she looks at me it's like um you are aware that

748
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:32,940
your california state id is expired right my wait what so i open up my wall i look at my id and i'm

749
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,660
you know holy shit it's expired so she pushes the resume back over to me it's like i'll tell you

750
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:42,700
what since you seem really enticed at the idea to start working again if you can get that id

751
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:49,020
renewed i'll give you the job immediately so i went to the dmv i spent three hours in line i got my

752
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:55,340
fucking id i went back i then asked alright can you start the training process so again i don't

753
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:00,620
know what kind of job they want me to work over at catholic charities but for whatever reason

754
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:06,540
they're like having me do random shit like firstly sit me in front of a computer and they

755
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:14,300
a shit you know they pop up mavis beacon i haven't done mavis beacon since elementary school they

756
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:23,580
want to check my typing speed i type at 35 words a minute so it then go and decides like actually

757
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:27,660
you know what you know we need to train you some more before we decide if you want to go work over

758
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:33,500
at catholic charities so they throw me a broom and a mop and they're like all right until we

759
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:37,660
feel like you're ready to go work over at catholic charities you're gonna be buckled is janitor

760
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:44,620
you're gonna you're gonna be a literal janny and you're gonna clean up our messes here's the problem

761
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,860
you would think since it's an office building it's a big building so there's lots to clean

762
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:57,580
no it is a small building with two rooms and a bathroom when you clean both rooms and the

763
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:03,580
bathroom you look at the clock and there's seven hours left of the day and you realize that you

764
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:11,900
now have to find busy work all day in a seven hour work day to pretend like you're doing something

765
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:18,940
important like when you run out of shit to clean like there's nothing left to clean like that's

766
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:23,180
right it's so dumb and like this was a problem i was having it's like i'm supposed to be trained

767
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:28,220
to go over to work at catholic charities right now you're treating me like a janitor like what am i

768
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:35,180
supposed to be trained for right now and here's what's really shitty my job coach came to me a

769
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:42,940
couple days later she sat me down it's like mer we're worried that you're not enthusiastic enough

770
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:49,340
about the job we've given you because it's really hard to be a janitor i mean you're not doing it

771
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:55,020
with a smile you're not doing it with a smile you fuck yeah fucking wagey why aren't you working

772
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:01,180
faster why aren't you coming into work every day like a mary poppins character going shitty shitty

773
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,780
bang bang all over the place and i'm just being thrilled that you work a fucking cognitive machine

774
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:14,860
so eventually my job coach is like all right i'm gonna go to your employer and i'm going to

775
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:19,180
tell her to motivate you because you don't seem motivated to do this how are you supposed to be

776
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:25,180
motivated to do this janitorial work is the lowest form of work you can ever put yourself through

777
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:30,540
nobody other than like people who are desperate and from third world countries because they're

778
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:35,740
willing to take a pay cut just to come to america just to do work like this because they don't want

779
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:42,380
to be in mexico anymore and i get sent into my boss's office and they're like i don't know who

780
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:47,820
trained you last but they did a horrible job and that was an insult because the person who trained

781
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:54,380
me last is one of my closest friends and the job i worked at before this job was a great job that's

782
01:13:54,380 --> 01:14:01,820
a longer story in its own right but point being i got unbelievably mad i already hated this job i

783
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:07,980
hated everything about this job so as she's just tearing into my ass right now i just said you know

784
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:15,740
what to fuck this i called her a piece of shit i called her all kinds of horrible different names

785
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:24,060
but here's the thing if anybody female sees a male disgruntled employee yelling at their female boss

786
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,780
all the females in the room suddenly become tumblr moderators they all start screaming

787
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:35,260
yas queen all the same time and the minute they hear me yelling at my boss all of them drop what

788
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:41,180
they're doing right now they all huddle in a fucking circle around their boss and they're like

789
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:47,100
you can't do that you're what's the problem with modern day you are a part of the future you can't

790
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:53,020
yell at your boss i'm like you know what this poor this this poor disenfranchised boss just being

791
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:59,180
just being just being discriminated against by her wagey employee how dare he yeah how how dare

792
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:06,460
he uses privilege in this way i got i pushed my chair i got up i took my resume i chucked it into

793
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,820
the air and i just i went over to wing stop and i ate food and then the following day i'm so sorry

794
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:18,300
wing stop is the worst i'm so sorry man i had a bad day and i went over to wing stop i ate food

795
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:24,780
and then the following day we then had the tubs fire which lasted for 10 days tubs fire the tubs

796
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:30,300
fire was one of the worst fires to ever happen in the state of california which is an understatement

797
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:37,740
considering how we now have terrible fires every year we had five back to back terrible fires this

798
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:44,780
year during shelter in place yeah yeah i saw the red sky do you see that red sky thing going on up in

799
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:50,620
like northern cali dude it's it was so bad at one point that i thought india declared war and they

800
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:54,460
fired a bunch of the trains into the air and they exploded because the sky was covered

801
01:15:54,460 --> 01:16:03,500
shit colored brown gross gross is right i couldn't breathe everything smelled bad it was awful uh

802
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:12,860
yikes um well so okay so i guess i guess that answer is where your money comes from came from

803
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:21,900
yeah uh what what what what else what else do we want to talk about anything you guys want i'm

804
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:25,100
hoping to talk about anything you can ask me what jeffrey eppstein killed himself

805
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,580
why why did jeffrey eppstein why would he do such a thing he had so much to live for

806
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:36,780
i don't know if you're a guy who has like a long fucking track record of raping and trafficking

807
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,980
kids dating all the way back to the 60s i i would think like that'd be concerned for somebody wanting

808
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:48,860
to kill you that's ridiculous that's totally ridiculous never never heard of i'm sure billionaire

809
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:53,980
people like the ross chow family and george soros would never put a hit on eppstein's head because

810
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,140
he fucked everything up and now everything's all wrong and the and the trafficking networks just

811
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,420
aren't working anymore clear clearly this was a suicide we all we all we all know it was we all

812
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,300
know it was the clinton's though right we know that mr eppstein got on his second story bed he said

813
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:13,100
look i'm going to do a flip right now i'm going to do a matt sidale for the shooting star press

814
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,340
and then he put more down and broke his neck that's clearly the narrative because you know believe

815
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:25,340
yeah uh well good good good you know good for him and glad he lived his he he lived his life

816
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:31,900
before it's raping children proud of my boy who'll make me proud of my boy eppstein

817
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:40,540
uh hey somebody fucking say something we i'm on my brain has been my brain has been rendered

818
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:45,820

819
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:50,220
a shitload of them and we are going to be going for an hour and 18 minutes we have fewer than usual

822
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:04,460
nobody knows you're on until the episode comes out so no they're not about you specifically

823
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:13,660
so are we just done here like do you need me here anymore or i mean if you want to stick around

824
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:20,220
then sure if if nobody else has any you know a discussion i guess i guess we'll go to voicemails

825
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:25,900
unless uh yeah i don't know we you can you can i had my most pressing question answered which is

828
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:49,900

829
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:54,860
money so that's a good i mean that would depend upon like you know there's there's like a good

830
01:18:54,860 --> 01:19:00,220

01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:05,980
3d equivalent of something that's cute is always cute you got to be convincing that's why it's called

835
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:30,460

836
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,380
say his dream is this not gonna happen like you know you really want this to happen but it's not

837
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:41,180
um you mean you mean this this business arrangement it's it's questionable it can't

838
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:45,420
happen because there's nobody there's not enough money involved for it to ever for it to happen

839
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:49,980
anyways i don't know i mean i got my logic was that projects right i mean i already got

842
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:10,700
you said you one you said you do it part of the reason you do it is to raise your online profile

843
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:16,620
do you have like an end game of like once you're known enough you know like you're gonna do something

844
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,100
is this project all building to some conclusion i thought to myself there was no way i was ever

845
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:28,380
going to reach a pkp posting after roosterteeth themselves fucking did a video on my deviant

846
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:32,220
art and they were looking out over all my deviant art stuff and i got really disappointed because

847
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:37,580
they didn't look at any of the ruby art all my carefully constructed ruby art of assaulting in

848
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:43,260
winter making out and made my pp very big why wouldn't they look at that because they didn't

849
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:48,060
have the time to look at it and it makes me sad because y'all created ruby look at my ruby art

850
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,580
that's what i really want you to look at that seems like that would be the first thing they would

851
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,260
look at i don't know it doesn't make any sense to me first it was that then i had the creator of

852
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,580
mighty magisort straight up tell me that i'm the worst human being on the face of the planet i hope

853
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:05,020
nobody ever draws me commission art so there was that i had the guy who created cookie well do you

854
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:10,300
know what the guy who created mighty magisort has one of the shittiest podcasts ever and made fun

855
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:18,220
of it on w ATP once so fuck that guy i had the guy who created cookie cookie clicker mentioned me

856
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:23,500
frequently on tumblr for whatever reason because he thinks my shit i love that guy he thinks my

857
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:29,180
shitposting is amusing so there was that um i love what's his name he's like it's like drag

858
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:35,580
that's his name something like that i've been on the master's in show i'm thinking to myself it's

859
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:40,220
like that has to be the peak now i'm here i'm thinking to myself it's like i need to create a

860
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:44,940
you've reached an ever higher peak yeah yeah so so now that you've now that you've conquered the

861
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:49,180
world and been on the procrastinators podcast i mean where is there even to go from here obviously

862
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:56,060
to go back on the master's in show again because i have lots to talk about okay yeah sure um i think

863
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,940
as i was saying about you being a branding genius like you were you were saying that

864
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:05,980
you keep commissioning them partially just to keep your name out there and uh like you said it's

865
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:12,940
landed you on all these podcasts and like i have i have a similar kind of like um i perpetuate

866
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:19,020
the existence of fan art of myself by always reblogging any fan art that anybody makes of me

867
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:27,180
and it seems that's not as i don't see it as much i seem to get more fan art than most people

868
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:31,420
by way of like just constantly promoting the fan art i get because then like people see it and

869
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:36,060
they want to copy it and then it's like every time i get one a bunch more like follows soon

870
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:42,780
afterwards and it's uh it's a good way to it's like a good way to create a brand identity

871
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:48,060
without even having to like let's like not like i have like a cartoon version of me

872
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,660
that like exists solidified at a bunch of people's minds you know what i mean

916
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:45,900
guys make oh wow okay moving on i have a series of four questions that i'd like to ask all of you

917
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:51,580
guys circumcision circumcision so the first is do you guys believe that people have an innate

918
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:59,900
responsibility to help one another why or why not the next is do you guys believe that unconditional

919
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:08,060
love is real why why not the third is does hardship really make someone stronger or do you believe

920
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:15,180
that's just a way to cope and finally would you guys prefer i do a drawing of brook and labud

921
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:22,220
or a picture of death the kid with liz and pat and tweeted at you guys all right thanks so much

922
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:28,140
thanks for making the pcp i really appreciate what you guys do um it's a little pretty big

923
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:33,740
questions in our own death the kid uh who is who is liz and pat the two girls are the guns

924
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:41,660
the gun girls that death the kid fights with uh oh you know wait i don't know what that's

925
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:46,140
from i don't fucking soul leader you do know what it's from god damn you've seen soul leader you

926
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:50,460
nerd i've seen the first three episodes of soul leader and i thought it was shit they introduced

927
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:55,020
definitely i did it i did i actually like soul leader a lot because of it actually like soul

928
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,500
leader a lot it's good it just doesn't it has a shitty ending because the manga was still going

929
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:05,660
and they had to wrap it up um but other than that it's great um well agreed wait i'm looking

930
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:13,020
at labudans better anyway liz and patty oh no they suck i don't like them uh the the other

931
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:23,020
questions he asked okay unconditional love uh uh no is is wait wait is unconditional love real uh

932
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:28,860
yes it is real but it shouldn't be i don't think it's real how do you think it's real what is it

933
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:35,180
what is that thing cool well it's when you it's when you love someone and no matter what they do

934
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:40,540
which is stupid like a like a decision you make i know i know i know that there are people who will

935
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:45,260
love somebody no matter how bad they are no matter how they mistreat them they shouldn't that is real

936
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:53,180
but that i would not i don't think that is unconditional per se like like how is okay that's

937
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:58,380
what it means the conditions are very very low bar well yeah exactly but it means it means the

938
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:03,020
conditions are very are in are unrealistically high that like it could never meet them to stop to

939
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:09,100
stop loving them there if there are people who will forgive someone literally anything there are

940
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:15,580
people who there okay but what i'm trying to say is like like okay so let's say that you have like

941
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:22,220
a brother and no matter what he does you'll still love him because he's your brother that's the condition

942
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,780
like it's can if you wouldn't do this for anybody you would only do this for your brother

943
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:31,900
because he's your brother but like yeah but like but this person being who they are there is nothing

944
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:38,300
they could do that would make you not love them i just can't imagine how you would find out like

945
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:48,300
like if you fall in love with someone then like it's not unconditional it's like there's something

946
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,460
about them that made you fall in love with them you know what i mean but like unconditional love

947
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:56,940
would have to just be like sprayed everywhere at all times because there's no condition but once

948
01:30:56,940 --> 01:31:01,900
you're but once you're in now that's stupid once you're in love with someone if there's nothing

949
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:07,500
that could make you stop then that's unconditional there i don't i think there are people who i think

950
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:13,180
that is cope semantics is how is that cope like it's just fucking you know not you mean something

951
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:19,500
i'm saying that unconditional love is cope like it is i mean it's it's very bad and stupid and i

952
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:25,740
don't i don't think well it's it's like you're convincing yourself that's that no matter what

953
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:32,220
you will love this person because that is easier than having there have to be like conditions so

954
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:40,940
it's it's like the the condition for it to stop is this is none unconditional yeah yeah yeah that's

955
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:47,660
that's bad i don't like that i think it's very very rare that it actually gets to such a point

956
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:52,300
they need to be like totally mindbroken that nothing would like absolutely nothing would

957
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:58,220
change their mind i mean people people write like uh love letters to like murders and prison and stuff

958
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:07,100
so it's real what do you mean what the fuck what the fuck do you mean

959
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:13,900
eh i don't fight me i'm having a trouble understanding what this concept i'm having a

960
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:19,740
trouble i'm having a trouble right here let's move on he also has many other he said do we

961
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:24,700
do people have an innate responsibility to help each other i mean response there's no

962
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,300
any there's no such thing as an innate responsibility like responsibility is

963
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:33,980
something that we judge i think we made we made up i think it would be fair to say that we have

964
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:40,380
instinctual reasons to help one another that like compel does an innate like desire for people to

965
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:46,860
cooperate that's like just sort of like a an instinctual thing yeah a responsibility though i

966
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:52,700
don't know about that no no and then the last part he asked was hard does hardship make you stronger

967
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:59,580
or is that just absolutely yes it does hardship makes you stronger uh i think i think in some cases

968
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:04,140
it might i think there's a huge ripping off of the band aid effect that comes with almost everything

969
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:09,980
in life that like anything that you are like afraid of or build up in your mind that like once you

970
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:16,860
experience it it can never be like scary again you know like unless it was really fucking bad like

971
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:20,540
and you really don't want to go through it again you know i don't know going through going through

972
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:28,220
hardship can make you like more afraid and wary of i guess it can happen i guess it can be better

973
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:34,380
or worse it just depends on how well you deal with it like it's like you know muscle growth is you

974
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:39,900
tear it and then it builds back but you have to eat enough protein or else it's not going to build back

975
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,940
you know it's like if you're just tearing your muscles and not fucking eating anything so wait

976
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:49,500
what was this question that there was it does hardship make you stronger or is that just cope

977
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:56,620
i think there's it's not just cope but it can be yeah i think i agree it can some some

978
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:02,540
sometimes it can be like oh i came out of it and like now i learned what not to do or or i learned

979
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:08,060
that i that it's not as bad as i thought but sometimes it is as bad as you thought and sometimes

980
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:12,540
it just can like fuck you up and like ruin your worldview and like make you a more miserable human

981
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:19,740
being because like now you know if you take the you know the breaking of muscle analogy to bones

982
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:24,460
once you break a bone you're much more likely to break the bone in that one spot again and again

983
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:32,940
yeah yeah yeah it cuts both ways all right good questions though um the next one is called um

984
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:42,540
i'm stupid the next one is called uh trying to be fear and loathing in real life three two one go

985
01:34:43,180 --> 01:35:01,660
okay all right next one is called uh pancakes all boomers must die three two one go hey pcp

986
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:07,740
you know it really grinds my gears or really butters my buns this one someone does something

987
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:13,740
that i don't really like and i criticize for it and some fucking boomer has the brass of balls to

988
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:23,660
say uh you know they have the right to do that yeah yeah yeah oh god i just want to get my fingers

989
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,780
around their necks in terms of the major's favorite shade of purple because for one i'm not saying

990
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:33,100
they don't have the right to do that that's a different conversation and second of all just

991
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:37,020
because someone has the right to do something doesn't mean it's always the right thing to do

992
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:43,180
and that's what i'm criticizing them for you boomers basis of fucking garbage uh i would just

993
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:47,980
agree with that yeah when you when you credit when you when you when you criticize someone

994
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:52,300
it's not you're not you can't always just be like oh well they have the right to do it because

995
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:57,260
that's not always the issue yeah it's it's it's like you just see something you say oh fuck this

996
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:02,540
it's like whether allowed to it's like that i the only fuck yeah the only time that like they have

997
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:06,700
the right to do it is the response is if the person is saying they can't do that or they

998
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,700
don't have the right to do it well if they do then maybe correct them but if that's not what

999
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,700
they're saying if they're saying oh this sucks like i you know this person is a piece of shit for

1000
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:19,740
doing this it's not you know maybe they they might do something that's legal and still and that's

1001

1039
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:21,580
with it but now you can oh okay three two one go having your wisdom teeth pulled is the circumcision

1040
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:30,220
of adulthood i mean i had my wisdom teeth i was a kid so oh really not really i all right i don't

1041
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:34,380
know too much at least at least they sent that they say they anesthetize you to get your wisdom

1042
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:40,860
teeth out isn't there like a a reason that they would take them out like it because they hurt

1043
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:47,980
if they hurt yeah i mean okay grow bad is not an objective criteria you know like i don't know

1044
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:52,460
like the thing about dentistry uh dentists are the worst people which is why they have such a

1045
01:41:52,460 --> 01:42:01,340
high suicide rate um and it's because dentistry is worthless it's just cosmetic it's not they

1046
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:06,620
try to tell you there's all these fucking health benefits to cleaning your fucking teeth but truly

1047
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:13,100
you just want to have white ass straight ass teeth so you look good on camera and but but the wisdom

1048
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:19,900
teeth thing they push they push the teeth they push your other teeth in such a way that can make them

1049
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:26,540
you know less straight or they can hurt personally i have wisdom teeth they don't hurt don't really

1050
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:32,940
care to have them removed don't really see what the point is i i have wisdom teeth as well um

1051
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:40,460
i i i i never understood every single time i see a dentist they're like i just assumed that if

1052
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:44,620
you get them removed it's because like oh yeah you know you ever seen the picture that episode of

1053
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:48,380
the simpsons where the Lisa goes the dentist and she gets braces and it's like if you don't have

1054
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:52,860
braces your teeth will go fucking through your eyeball that'll happen if you don't okay braces

1055
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:57,260
the worst meme in the whole universe because you wear them for years and then you wear a retainer

1056
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:01,980
every day for the rest of your life so they don't straighten your teeth like they they will get them

1057
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:07,500
into a position where you can maintain them in that position but i stopped wearing i stopped wearing

1058
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,620
a retainer i actually like never wore my retainer and like it's fine like it didn't my teeth didn't

1059
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:19,740
go back to being shit i've seen people's teeth go back to being shit before it was braces didn't

1060
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:26,860
work but um you know uh shit well i was like oh yeah the every time you go to a dentist for any

1061
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:32,300
reason they'll they'll they they frame it in that salesman like way where they'll say when are you

1062
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:38,300
getting your wisdom teeth removed like when should i schedule you for a wisdom teeth removal like who

1063
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:44,220
should i refer to you to and the response i always say is like do i need to have them out and they

1064
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:50,860
well do they hurt or like they will hurt and i say well they don't hurt now so like do i need to

1065
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:56,460
have them out they're like well i mean technically no i'm like well then why is it being framed to

1066
01:43:56,460 --> 01:44:01,740
me like it is absolutely inevitable that you are going to pull out my wisdom teeth but like they

1067
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:06,860
frame it that way because they want you to spend the money on it obviously maybe maybe my parents

1068
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:12,860
just fell for the meme i don't know everyone all society has fallen for the meme every time well

1069
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:20,220
i mean in the uk they didn't push it on on me they just they're just sort of like i don't even remember

1070
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:24,540
them saying anything about it actually i just go to the dentist they look around they say yeah that's

1071
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:29,340
good americans are really weird about teeth we don't care about being fat as fuck we only care

1072
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:36,540
about having straight white teeth it's a strange place uh next one is called down with mortality

1073
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:43,020
propagandists three two one go have you ever been talking with someone about immortality

1074
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:47,740
in there like oh yeah if humans weren't if humans didn't die then it would suck actually yeah there

1075
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:52,060
would be no time with it on life i hate this meme this is good call already anything cooler

1076
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:56,460
productive sooner than later we just procrastinate forever and lays around this always seems

1077
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:00,780
strange to me because like by the very fact that this is framed as a negative it means that you

1078
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:06,380
wouldn't let this happen like suppose you were immoral right and you were upset at the fact that

1079
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:13,180
you're not doing anything you wouldn't think oh man i wish i had the ability to die because then

1080
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:17,660
i would have a reason to do something no you would think man i should do something i'm not doing

1081
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:23,260
something so i'll go do something yeah it's right it's is that not obvious it like what a stupid

1082
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:29,100
what a stupid idea to be like oh boy well good it's it's good that we die because it like makes

1083
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:33,420
people like you know make their fucking magnum opus or like who fucking anybody who thinks that

1084
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:39,660
do that sorry anybody who thinks that clearly hates their life like yeah you'd have to you'd

1085
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:44,620
have to be a fucking moron and like just have like absolutely no value to your own life to be like

1086
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:50,300
it's good that one day i will cease to exist um yeah it's i mean it goes even further than just

1087
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:58,460
that reason it's like like if you're immortal you can't die um you don't need to do anything

1088
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:04,140
what's the problem with not doing anything yeah also yeah if you if if you're content

1089
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:09,020
not doing anything i mean if you're not content then you have forever to do stuff there's always

1090
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:14,860
like there's no downside really the arguments they always portray it as like oh i've been alive for

1091
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:22,460
10 billion years and i'm so bored if only there was something that was interesting in this shonen anime

1092
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:28,540
uh and i'm the villain uh-huh it's like it's i don't know whether i mean there's no way to

1093
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:33,340
really know what happens to the human brain but like the reason people go crazy when they get

1094
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:38,780
older is not because it they live for a long times because human bodies age and they become

1095
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:43,420
decrepit and they the cells die and then they they lose their functionality if you didn't have any

1096
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:50,140
of that if you just were fine forever i don't know whether anything of that is bad would happen

1097
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:56,620
i mean i mean i guess eventually overpopulation like we might just i don't know if everyone's

1098
01:46:56,620 --> 01:47:01,180
immortal you mean if if like yeah if the entire world were just like choked with humans but like

1099
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:05,340
i don't think that would necessarily be a problem it's just there's just like not enough biomass

1100
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:10,780
oh this happens in final fantasy 13 lightning returns and uh everybody becomes immortal and

1101
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,940
they just stop being able to have kids and so there's just like the same people who are around

1102
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:20,540
for like five thousand years that's what that's what happens in 17776 is one day everyone just

1103
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:24,700
stops aging and stops being able to have kids and the world just becomes a complete and it's

1104
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:30,140
awesome like it's so awesome i want to live in 17776 but lightning returns is pretty cool too uh

1105
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:35,100
there's like all these odin gods and shit running around doing stuff it's neat there was this there

1106
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:44,060
was this like um uh dnd like green text post thing i i read once which was really interesting um and

1107
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:50,300
it reminds me of this this idea that like if if you could have children and you were immortal

1108
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:57,580
the amount of human mass would just continually like grow out of control and the the dnd post was

1109
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:04,140
like there was a skeleton and it had the ability to summon a skeleton that could summon a skeleton

1110
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:09,100
and then um they failed at killing the skeleton and after a few rounds there was like a hundred

1111
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:14,620
skeletons it was multiplying exponentially and so they had to run they had to run far away

1112
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:19,420
and the skeletons never stopped and they just sort of like they saw in the in the distance

1113
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:24,940
there was like a writhing mass of bones constantly undulating and growing and and it was taking over

1114
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:29,180
the entire planet and the sea and they were like all over the place it was just like oh my god

1115
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:36,140
yeah it's like it's like doubling itself every round yeah and it's like they couldn't do anything

1116
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:42,700
and then like they all died the entire planet became filled with skeletons so that you couldn't

1117
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:47,900
see it the skeletons continued to grow outwards until the mass of the skeletons was so great

1118
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,740
that it collapsed in on itself and it became a black hole or a supernova

1119
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:57,660
yeah something something like and it created a new star and that star was like named after

1120
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:03,260
like the event and then in their future dm campaign uh dungeons and dragons campaigns that

1121
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:09,020
star was in the sky and they could like look at it that's so funny that's so fucking funny so that's

1122
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:13,420
that's what would happen if you could still have kids and be immortal is that if unless we

1123
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:19,500
spread out we would become okay if you're immortal does that mean you cannot die or just that you

1124
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:26,860
don't die of natural causes i would assume you just cannot die if you can't die then i don't know

1125
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:32,220
that's that that's weird and like yeah i guess maybe you would just eventually just choke the whole

1126
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:37,740
world with humans but that seems like stupid like if you could die of natural causes like and

1127
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:43,180
we did just eventually use up all of like the carbon on earth and like to create biomass for

1128
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:48,060
human beings eventually there would just be no more human beings and we would just have to literally

1129
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:53,580
have to eat each other in order to like feed on anything god it's such a cool premise for a place

1130
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,780
because there'd be nothing else to eat there'd be no more plants or animals all carbon on the world

1131
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:05,500
would be devoted to human being human life uh yeah like like like the magma the the mantle or whatever

1132
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:12,620
is like all it was how would that even happen like all of the rock that makes up the earth gets

1133
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:20,380
replaced slowly with human biomass this is filled the human like it just becomes the earth is just

1134
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:28,860
filled to the core with a writhing mass of beings crammed in gross oh cool um that's that's what

1135
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:34,060
hell i have to address the the other thing about immortality that everybody always is like

1136
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,300
i don't want to be immortal because i have to watch all my friends die and everybody you love

1137
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:42,380
die if you're like the only one i'm sure that would suck but like i'm sure that would suck the thing is

1138
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:49,740
a you're gonna do that anyway if you live long enough like but like yeah you can make more friends

1139
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:54,140
like it's it's like it's like like the like the logical conclusion of that is like oh

1140
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:59,020
they're so so what you're saying is that you should kill yourself now before anyone you know dies

1141
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,860
right yeah like that's what you're saying you want like death is prefer death is preferable

1142
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:06,140
to seeing someone you love die yeah that's what you're saying right people seem to think that

1143
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:11,740
they're going to like run out and like the only reason that old people like run out is that they

1144
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:17,660
know they're going to die and so they don't like make an effort to like make a bunch of new things

1145
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:23,100
begin in their life it's like when you it's it's hard to like even for young people like

1146
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:27,500
young people don't want to hang around old people because they know they're going to die soon you

1147
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:33,660
know like the the the attraction of being younger is knowing how much potential is ahead of you

1148
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:41,660
you know and like i think that the the way that human life tends to be structured is just based

1149
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:46,300
on the fact that we happen to live the amount of time we do but like if you were immortal

1150
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:52,380
you would just have no reason to ever stop being involved in everything you know in the

1151
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:58,380
world like personally i want to be able to see like the ramifications of things across generations

1152
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:04,540
you know like i can see like i get to watch the effects of my actions for as long as i'm alive

1153
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:10,860
for what if i got to see like the ripple of that across fucking thousands of years you know um

1154
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:15,740
i want to know what's going to happen to humanity i'm interested in this story

1155
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:22,940
it sucks that i don't get to see very much of it you know i think absolutely the only real thing

1156
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:28,540
that could be like oh it's bad to be immortal is not for the person who is immortal but it's like

1157
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:34,220
you could become a villain that is unstoppable and you could start just for fun just fucking with

1158
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:37,660
other people and murdering them and you'll be like yeah i mean i've killed so many people it

1159
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:42,620
doesn't even feel that bad anymore in the same way that seeing your friends die over and over again

1160
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:47,260
for thousands of years you'd be like yeah that friends die that's normal it doesn't already feel

1161
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:54,300
that way you could easily like get dull to a lot of things and then you could be the bad guy and

1162
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:58,220
that's i feel that way just from having like because i've moved so many times in my life that

1163
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:03,500
like the idea that people just pass through your life is very normal to me like yeah you just sometimes

1164
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:08,780
just don't see motherfuckers anymore you know so like yeah to me the idea is like but you like

1165
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:14,220
that doesn't prevent you from newly having a best another best friend you know like there's always

1166
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:19,180
going to be interesting people you want to hang out with so like you know just because some of them

1167
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:23,500
die doesn't mean the new ones aren't springing up for you to hang out with you know like there's

1168
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:30,380
always going to be somebody who's interesting yeah agree uh yeah fun things like trying to be like

1169
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:38,460
mortality for 100 years straight but by a similar token uh it's not the same but i feel like it's

1170
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:45,180
related people there's always one idiot at like any party who if pressed will say like oh yeah i kind

1171
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:50,860
of think like humanity should be destroyed lol like we are the virus and like i fucking hate those

1172
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:56,220
people if we are the virus we will be we will be corrected anyways like those people are sick but

1173
01:53:56,220 --> 01:54:00,700
like it's been normalized it's been normalized as sort of like like baby's first edgy take that's

1174
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:05,340
like how the world would be better off without humanity like fuck you like go fuck yourself i

1175
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:10,460
don't know start with you yourself please literally start with yourself like if you think

1176
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:16,540
be the change you want to see like i know like i know humanity does bad things to other people

1177
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:22,220
to other species but i'm not a other species i'm a human and as a human i am i'm i'm bigoted in

1178
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:29,500
my own favor i i am invested in humanity's success like sorry if that's a fucking problem for you

1179
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:33,580
there's a there's a guy there's a guy that i started following i don't know why on twitter

1180
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:41,420
he's some kind of like he's some kind of like like um anarcho primitivist like like eco terrorist

1181
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:47,900
communist guy or whatever and he says that like he's he's he's he's he's super like pro animal

1182
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:52,700
rights but he if that's not even good enough for him he says like yeah like humanity like

1183
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:57,340
fuck humanity uh we need to protect animals but even that's not good enough because animals

1184
01:54:57,340 --> 01:55:02,620
would just be colonizers like humans if they could even animals are like too are too corrupt

1185
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:08,940
only only the plants and fun guy like our our true allies yeah this is a good argument

1186
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:17,660
i don't know why um i thought he was funny that anyway yeah um life isn't it good yeah

1187
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:21,500
but plants fight each other too the trees they hug all of the sunlight for the little flowers

1188
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:26,540
underneath so we need to chop down all the trees there's trouble with the trees for the maples

1189
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:32,540
want more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas but but they don't do it on with on purpose

1190
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:37,660
they don't do it with malice of forethought we'll see the trouble with the maples and they're quite

1191
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:42,380
convinced they're right is that the oaks are just too lofty and they grab up all the light but the

1192
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:46,940
oaks can't help their feelings if they like the way they're made and they wonder why the maples

1193
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:52,620
can't be happy in their shade no it's a rush song and then pacifica northwest comes in she destroys

1194
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:57,980
them all makes bread well at the end they they pass along yeah they pass a law that the trees are all

1195
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:08,860
kept equal by hatchet ax and saw oh my god yeah one from the law x soldier rides away uh it's

1196
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:13,980
libertarian propaganda about how how socialism bad i think

1197
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,740
uh wait is that is that what rush is like i think that song is at least some like i mean the

1198
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:29,020
message of the song is basically that like you know uh the the maples are like the oaks are

1199
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:32,460
taking up all of our sunlight and they're like well there's nothing we could do about it and they're

1200
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:37,900
like yeah there is what will all be equal and so they all get cut down like oh man you ever you

1201
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:42,700
ever read that book animal farm you ever read animal farm that like fairy tale like yeah man

1202
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:49,660
like communism would never work lamal uh uh that's the proof uh you ever hear that rush song nah dude

1218
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:59,020
you guys were talking about accents and language in the last episode and it got me curious what you

1219
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:03,820
think about music and other languages personally i think it's fantastic it's a great way to gain

1220
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:08,620
comprehension in a language plus there's the whole point that they made in his anime and music video

1221
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:12,700
about how if you don't understand what's being said completely you can imprint whatever you find

1222
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:17,100
to be the most appealing message onto a song also i don't know if anyone can relate to this but i

1223
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:22,780
feel like music and languages that are not english tend to have way better instrumentals i don't know

1224
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:28,060
thoughts uh i think that's just not true i don't i don't think you're right about that i don't

1225
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:31,100
think you're right about that last one i think you're probably just maybe paying more attention

1226
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:37,580
to the instrumentals maybe because you can't focus on the words um i i like listening to uh foreign

1227
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:44,700
music obviously tons of japanese music and like there's lots of countries that like make music

1228
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:50,220
that sounds like stuff that would be from america or the uk like influenced by that stuff just sings

1229
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:56,860
in english because like they want to have more global appeal ah so i i've i've um recently

1230
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:05,500
discovered some like saharan desert like prog rock that sounds like jimmy hendrix but it with like um

1231
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:14,060
islam islamic uh you know singing it's really cool it's like a language the arabic islamic

1232
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:22,940
arabic where'd you where'd you study in arabic yeah look i um stupid okay do you send a link

1233
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:27,260
to that band uh yeah let me let me get have you wait have you have you kept studying arabic

1234
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:33,500
actually i i sort of dropped off because because the um the app sort of it's sort of

1235
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:40,300
it got to a peak of like what it could teach me with me like learning new stuff i was just

1236
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:46,060
sort of doing the same things over and over again and i needed i needed to like step up the amount

1237
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:52,300
the the level of teaching in order to actually learn how to like speak it and and stuff and i

1238
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:59,020
never went into that much because the app was so easy i needed i needed to like study it like a real

1239
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:05,260
thing and they're like that's hard i don't want to do anything definitely sounds hard lamal um yeah i

1240
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:11,180
like music in other languages like fucking i was a kid listen to fucking anime op's and be like ah

1241
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:16,380
this is so beautiful what a beautiful language i don't know what it means but it you just it

1242
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:19,900
could just entirely focus on the melody and it can mean whatever you want it to me there are certain

1243
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:24,300
languages that have like different advantages when it comes to being sung and i think that

1244
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:30,140
english is a language that is popular because partially because it sounds really good in music

1245
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:35,980
um broad range of vowel sounds like japanese there's only five vowel sounds that they use

1246
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:43,820
in their language so like um you know there's like a lot of cleanliness to japanese singing because

1247
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:52,460
of the fact that like again they only use like uh they only use syllables like full syllables to

1248
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:58,380
communicate so like their words are more simple and easier to pronounce and easier to make melodies

1249
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:06,780
out of um i i don't okay i could be wrong but i think i read something by like an essay or maybe

1250
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:12,700
it was an intro to lolita by nabokov the the guy who wrote lolita and other books too um and i think

1251
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:18,380
he said that he wrote because he was russian but he wrote in english he like lolita is not translated

1252
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:22,460
he wrote it in english and he wrote him any other books in english too and i'm pretty sure the reason

1253
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:27,980
why is because he found english was like a very lyrical language or a poetic language or a language

1254
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:34,060
that he found it was easy to make like like like a poetic like illusions and like similes and

1255
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:38,300
metaphors and stuff with i think he just found english to be good for that better than russian

1256
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:44,620
so i guess some languages are more like that than others in ways yeah i think it depends on like

1257
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:51,100
that like you said lyrical and like i'm thinking about like the difference between lyrical and

1258
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:55,580
poetic as like how they could because i'm thinking about like how lyrical miracle spiritual like in

1259
02:02:55,580 --> 02:03:01,100
chinese they have like ridiculous amounts of like metaphors and different meanings for words to the

1260
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:06,700
point that there's like this one poem that famously is just like she written like 50 times but it's

1261
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:13,500
all different definitions of she um but like uh buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo yeah like that but

1262
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:20,780
much more extreme um yeah and like so chinese has that advantage of like it can be extremely

1263
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:27,420
metaphorical and poetic and impressionistic um but like it doesn't sound as good sung because

1264
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:32,860
there's so much like uh of the throat i think that has to be like used you know like a lot of

1265
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:39,980
languages that use more like it's like it's not as easy to say that english everything is just

1266
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:55,660
you know like that's what it sounds like center it sounds like center language wait

1267
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:59,820
wait was that a creed or who who is that an impression of uh fuck that songs by like i don't

1268
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:03,500
counting crows or something wait wait wait is that hoody in the blowfish

1269
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:12,300
no it's like a really mellow song Dave Matthews band no no it's mellower than any of that it's

1270
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:17,340
it's that it's that band with with the black um front man that is hoody in the brush fish but

1271
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:25,180
oh okay you're right all right the the guy i was thinking of was mudo mokta i don't know how to say

1272
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:32,860
his name i think that's it i posted a link he's like he's just so cool he's he's playing the guitar

1273
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:39,500

1279
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:22,300
okay so ben was talking about super salty stuff yeah and it reminded me of this game that i used

1280
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:27,580
to play with friends at some gatherings uh called salty dog where what you do have however many

1281
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:32,620
people at a table you get that many sugar packets you rip them all open but fold them over so the

1282
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:38,860
contents don't come out but one of them you pour it out and replace it with salt so then you mix up

1283
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:43,900
all of the sugar packets everyone grabs one at random and three two one you just pour it into your

1284
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:51,020
mouth all together at the same time and one person is the unlucky fool who is the salty dog who gets

1285
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:57,660
a mouthful of like a whole packet of salt at once this is just russian real entertaining ragcon five

1286
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:05,980
salty dog tournament win this is just russian roulette with salt i mean isn't a big full mouthful

1287
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:11,660
of sugar also a bit weird i guess it's not as bad no it's not that bad no i used to eat sugar just

1288
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:16,460
like i used to go to mcdonald's and just grab handfuls of sugar packets stuff them in my pockets

1289
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:21,580
and then just drink them like one at a time all day i mean i probably wouldn't love it that's very

1290
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:27,500
america core yeah yeah that's true uh uh it's yeah i was back also around the time i used to just

1291
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:34,700
like eat sweet and condensed milk by the spoonful i wonder what a i'll eat i'll eat honey by the

1292
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:39,500
spoonful i love honey some people don't like it uh uh jenny nicholson said in a video she had to

1293
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:44,220
eat a spoonful of honey and she was like ew gross i hate it and i i was like shocked and horrified

1294
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:48,380
no that's great what are you talking about i do you think i would gag if i ate that much at once

1295
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:54,220
of it probably i i a spoonful of well depends on the size of the spoon i guess i'm picturing the

1296
02:06:54,220 --> 02:07:00,460
largest spoon i can think of like it's like a pretty big spoon i could i i like a jar of honey

1297
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:05,100
fine tablespoon i'll take it i'll take a jar of honey and just squirt a whole bunch of it into my

1298
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:12,860
mouth like no problem no problem i love it um sounds like it would taste like well yeah obviously

1299
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:18,620
i wonder what it would taste like if a packet of salt if you ate a miracle berry you know about

1300
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:23,980
miracle berries no i think we've talked about them before there those like berries that you can eat

1301
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:32,140
and they make your tongue different so like you can't taste sourness anymore oh and it's like it's

1302
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:37,660
like if you eat a miracle berry you can then like eat like drink like pure lemon juice or like drink

1303
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:42,300
vinegar and like it doesn't taste bad it tastes different i wonder if that would

1304
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:47,100
affect like a packet of salt or or maybe you wouldn't i don't know we'll have to find out

1305
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:52,620
we'll have to do an extensive i've always wanted i always wanted to try a good video idea like numb

1306
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:56,780
your tongue with this stuff and then see what different shit happens we're like what happens

1307
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:03,500

1308
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:09,260
