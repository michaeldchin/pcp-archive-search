00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:54,800
I am the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Tom Oliver.

3
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It's like, I've just been talking about it on Discord, like it seems to be everyone in the world has seen this as a child and knows about it, and I've never heard of it until the end. Yeah, this is an old movie, like near the beginning of 3D, I suppose, where it was just like really badly made, and it's got some famous people in it. It's kind of like Aunt Bully, but worse.

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah, it's probably before they figured out what are these activities based on the movie. It's gotta be like a coloring book, right?

6
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay, this is probably like a coloring book that comes with it or something. Man, this looks terrible. Well anyway, so what else is going on people?

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Oh, I get it, it's like Red Riding Hood Winked. Yeah, yeah, I think so, and these are all the characters, the woodsman and the frog, famously. Yeah, he was always my favorite guy.

8
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The detective frog, Mr. Frog. Oh my, what a green skin you have. The grandma's spicy lover.

9
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Hey, so this is the first week. You'll be hearing this, I think, yeah, one week into the hashtag PCP editor contest is up and running people, so let me just get that out of the way.

10
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You'll still have one week to make a fucking entry. We'll, again, put the link in the show notes. There's a video on this channel with just the condensed stuff, so you could just go fucking check that probably.

11
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Maybe we'll just link that in the show notes instead. Yeah, go fucking enter the contest if you want to be the official every week PCP editor. All the details are in the document and in the video, so go read this carefully and enter if you care to.

12
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:43,800
We've already gotten a bunch of submissions though. Remember viewers, whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right. That was, Albert Einstein said that.

13
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:54,800
That's very wise. That's very wise. Carl Sagan said that. Michio Kaku said that. Black Science Man said that.

14
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Orange Man Bad said that most famously. Dude, I love Orange Man Bad. I follow him on Twitter. I saw Orange Man Bad today in a Cheetos ad. It is Chester Cheeto we're talking about, right?

15
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah, no Cheeto Man, Cheeto Man. Oh sorry, Cheeto Man, right.

16
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I have been recently getting absorbed in watching my brother play a video game. It's like a personal stream. That's what I did when I was young.

17
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,800
And it's cool because in his room. I would just bully Nate and make it. Well, Nate, did I? I was pretty content.

18
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I was going to say, yeah, I didn't have to make you watch me play video games. You just liked to.

19
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah, I mean, I was like around six to ten probably in those videos.

20
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I think sometimes I felt bad like I was like being mean like, oh, I'm hogging the video game. But like, I think that was just kind of what you were into for a while there.

21
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah, I mean, not exclusively.

22
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,800
People with siblings who play video games understand like the appeal of let's plays before they were real.

23
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Yeah, because it's sometimes it is just fun to just sit back and just watch somebody play a game.

24
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Share both similarly friends simulators, but not real friends.

25
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Podcasts and siblings, both social relationships.

26
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah, but it's good in his room because he's got like a big old like a big old widescreen TV from like when we upgraded the TV downstairs.

27
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
You've got the big word word and hooked it up so that it's like a huge TV up on a table.

28
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
And he's got this chair and I just sit in the chair and it's like a cinema.

29
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm watching him play this game called Kenshi, which is really, really cool and really in depth.

30
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
And here's my game review is my hypocrite game review. I'm coming back.

31
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,800
This is where you get the information. Kenshi, it's a game about it's a survival game,

32
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,800
but it is incredibly rich with depth of like mechanics and systems.

33
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Basically, it's it's hard to explain really quick.

34
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:14,800
But if I had like words, it would be like a rustic, like unrefined looking reality simulator.

35
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,800
You have your guy that you you can create and it's got he's got like D&D RPG stats.

36
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:32,800
So like all sorts of stats like thieving, farming, fighting with certain weapons and things, toughness, you know, and all these different races.

37
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,800
And you can recruit people in bars and you can form a squad and you can steal and you can fight and you can you can band together.

38
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,800
And you run around in this huge open world landmass and you just you just survive, you just do whatever you want.

39
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
You can mine materials.

40
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Is landmass the name of the continent?

41
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Yeah, why not?

42
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I hope so.

43
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,800
From the southern reaches of landmass where we all call home.

44
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,800
And it's it's got the like the same energy as Minecraft.

45
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's like a fucking age of empires, but each individual person in your huge team is an individual person who has like a personality and can interact with other characters.

46
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:32,800
It's like D&D if it was like a time a turn based RTS, which is a strange way to put it, but it's like you can pause the game and like move inventory while it's paused.

47
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
And like, you know, you have people like you can assign jobs to them.

48
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:47,800
So like if you have, say, a farm, you need a storage for the wheat so that the wheat can be put somewhere once it's been harvested.

49
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,800
And then you have a grain silo where the wheat goes in and then out comes flour and flour has its own storage box.

50
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,800
You put the flour in there and then you can take it out of there and put it into the bread place to make the bread.

51
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:11,800
And then you have food and you have a person you right click you shift right click on like the bread and the person you shift right click on the bread oven.

52
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,800
And the AI will be like, okay, I need wheat, so he'll go check the storage.

53
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,800
If there's wheat, if there's no wheat, he'll go immediately to go, you know, do all the other things for them.

54
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Yeah, like, yeah, it's it's really advanced AI.

55
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:35,800
It looks like a really old game, but it's I think it's kind of new and it's like a Kickstarter or early access something or other that's now PC.

56
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Yes, on PC.

57
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Pretty cool.

58
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Well, it came out 2013 looks like.

59
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Okay.

60
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yeah.

61
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
And it's just it's just there's so much to it.

62
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
It's so cool.

63
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,800
It's like the biggest in depth RPG world big thing of all time.

64
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
And I really like it.

65
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Well, dope, dude.

66
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
We need a WRPG on this.

67
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I've been.

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh, yeah.

69
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh, yeah.

70
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Wait, I was gonna say you mean.

71
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Oh, wait, I get it.

72
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
I get it.

73
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You're making because it's g r p j.

74
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Well, wouldn't it be wouldn't it be g r p w.

75
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah, g r p.

76
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay.

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Yeah, good reason to play Western RPG.

78
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I guess.

79
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Yeah.

80
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Yeah.

81
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I've been playing.

82
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I've been playing Stardew Valley.

83
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I mean a little bit here and there.

84
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I've started just for the rfck episode.

85
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
I started a file because I was like, well, this is a good game to play.

86
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
It's like fucking, you know, yeah.

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
It's a great game for that.

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
And then I started a file and I created the character of Jenny.

89
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Jenny the Juvie, who is a farmer in Arson Brook Farms.

90
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
And I fell in love with Jenny, who is a man.

91
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I am gay now.

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Oh, okay.

93
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
But the thing is, okay, so this might be a little bit of spoiler, but I have plans.

94
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I have plans for anyone who has played a lot of Stardew Valley will know this,

95
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
but turns out you can breed and farm and ranch slimes.

96
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Yeah.

97
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,800
And so I'm like, well, I think I know what Jenny the Juvie has to become.

98
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I like, yeah, she's sorry.

99
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
He, I get confused.

100
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
He's a slime rancher.

101
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
He's got a quote unquote slime rancher game.

102
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
If you, if you, if you will, God, I wish slime rancher had multiplayer.

103
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
But, but you did.

104
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
So, I don't know.

105
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Jenny's got Jenny's got a really nice functioning farm, you know, cows, sheep, cheese,

106
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
goats, what?

107
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Tomatoes, you know, Jenny's raking it in.

108
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
But I think, I think what she said on what any good Juvie is heart is set on,

109
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
and that's slime.

110
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,800
So he's got, he's got his work cut out for him to, you know, to, to, to, to go about

111
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
achieving, you know, do what he wants to do.

112
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
He's got my poor abandoned Stardew Valley file.

113
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I haven't played in, I don't know, six, seven, eight months or so.

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm sure they're doing fine.

115
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Yeah.

116
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
So it's not like, it's different from Animal Crossing where it keeps track of time

117
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
that passes while you don't play.

118
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Oh God, imagine if you went back to your farm and it was like,

119
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
wrecked.

120
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
It was, it was just like, it was all like rotted over and the trees were all dead.

121
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I mean, the Animal Crossing system is rather cruel.

122
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Yeah.

123
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,800
To just, like you have to keep playing it or things fall into despair.

124
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

125
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
And it's a nightmare.

126
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
It's very cruel to do.

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,800
You get back there and fucking, and fucking Sally, Sally the goat or whatever, like the

128
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
bank foreclosed on her house.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah.

130
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Like, and like, you know, Johnny, Johnny the, Johnny the sea cucumber.

131
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,800
It's like, he never leaves his house anymore because his only friend in the world stopped

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,800
calling him and he got depressed and he went off his meds and stuff.

133
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Yeah.

134
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Much.

135
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You know.

136
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I mean, I'm sure you guys have all seen that one comic about the dude who has like his

137
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
DS, whatever, version of a movie for whatever.

138
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Oh yeah.

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
And he's like playing and he hasn't played in a while and he's like, you know, I want

140
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
to go back, but I'm, I'm just so like, if I pick it up, they're going to be so mad at

141
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
all my friends.

142
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
They're going to, they've all forgotten about me and moved on.

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
And then he, and then it just cuts to the world of Animal Crossing where they're having

144
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,360
a little party with like a framed picture of his character saying like never forgotten

145
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,800
as they all like party around a fire.

146
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh no.

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I thought you were going to talk about the one, have you read the one where like the kid

148
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,560
is playing, like the kid's mom had cancer and she started playing Animal Crossing and

149
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
she really liked it.

150
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh yeah.

151
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,960
And then he started getting gifts from his mom, but like, isn't that just a thing that

152
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,400
happens in the game?

153
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,960
Like it's not like his mom actually sent him gifts in Animal Crossing.

154
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Okay, but it probably made him feel like she was still there or something.

155
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,800
I felt like the story implies that like, wow, my mom did all this in the game.

156
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Like just, she just wanted to express her love for me in her final days.

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
It's like, I don't, I don't know about all that.

158
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Well, okay.

159
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
This guy needs a fucking wake up call.

160
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Your mom's dead and she never loved you that much too, so it's time to get over it.

161
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
She just liked fucking Tom Nook.

162
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
She just was a big, she just really liked gathering coral on the beach.

163
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
You idiot.

164
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Okay, that might be true.

165
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,960
You know, Stardew Valley is just Terraria flattened and Terraria is just Minecraft flattened.

166
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,960
And Terraria and Minecraft is just a Moon, Harvest Moon, but in HD.

167
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
But the same.

168
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Yeah.

169
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,960
And the best one, the best one I still think is, okay, Minecraft is pretty amazing, but

170
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Terraria I think is the best like game.

171
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Nope.

172
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
It's the most fun to like play through.

173
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
No?

174
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Maybe.

175
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I don't know.

176
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I always get bored of building because like your base is just, I guess it's just a load

177
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
of sideways.

178
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
A load of bullshit.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
A load of bullshit.

180
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
It's not, building bases in Terraria is not as interesting.

181
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
In Minecraft, you can go really crazy.

182
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,960
It's, it's, yeah, it's definitely better in Minecraft, but, but it's a trade off of less.

183
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I mean, Terraria doesn't really have much of like a building aspect to it.

184
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,960
No, but what it does have is like the unlocking new biomes and like exploring the world.

185
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah.

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,960
And like that's way more satisfying in Terraria than it is in Minecraft.

187
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
In my humble opinion.

188
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,960
That is, that is true, but I, there's something about.

189
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Minecraft has very, it doesn't have that sense of progression.

190
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Yeah.

191
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah.

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Yeah.

193
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I suppose so.

194
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Not as much in Minecraft.

195
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,620
But like as like, I mean mining and crafting and, and building the three things.

196
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,760
I love building and walking around my creations.

197
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Like I see a mountain.

198
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't know why they didn't call the game Minecraft build.

199
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Yeah.

200
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I see like a cool, like a recently before I stopped playing games forever.

201
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I was in this Minecraft world where I had built this cool base.

202
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,960
There were like four, like really steep sharp hills that went straight up like spikes.

203
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,960
And I built a house on all four, all four corners of those hills.

204
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,960
And it was just sort of like, looks like it was supported by them.

205
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
How do you get up there?

206
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Oh, the house is sitting on top of the, there's like the pillars.

207
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
And the floor is glass and the ceiling is glass.

208
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,960
So the sun goes all the way down to the bottom and it's really cool.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,960
And I had like another fortress, another gate and I went through it and I found myself in

210
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,960
a big old desert and it just started building a real pyramid.

211
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,960
It was just like, I just love stuff in Minecraft.

212
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,960
It doesn't even need to be like interesting or like, you know, the coolest like gameplay

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
experience of all time.

214
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,960
It's just like the slow progression of carving the world to make it look how I like.

215
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
It's really, it's really engrossing.

216
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Have you ever seen, you ever watched Shadow of Izrafel, the Yogscast series in Minecraft?

217
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I've heard you talk about it before.

218
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Have I talked about that on PCP before and how much I love Shadow of Izrafel?

219
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Man, well, I'll give a brief recap.

220
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I won't get too much into it, but it's a long, it's a long like Let's Play series where Simon

221
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,960
and Louis, Simon and Louis, Simon, they're playing, they're playing Minecraft.

222
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,960
And at first, like they're just, you know, they're building a base to try to survive.

223
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,960
They're just, they're just playing Minecraft, but then they find this like pyramid that

224
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
they didn't build.

225
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
And there's like a little sort of like game in there where they got to jump across like,

226
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,960
like blocks to get across lava to find the chests with stuff in it.

227
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
And they're like, oh, I guess, you know, I guess there are other Yogscasts people like

228
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
put this here.

229
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
How, how, what a goof.

230
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
And then like they find, like someone else logs in and they don't know who it is.

231
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,960
And it's like, it's someone else and, and like he's just, and he starts attacking them

232
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
and they're like, who is this guy?

233
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,960
And then the guy runs away and they follow him and they find this road.

234
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,960
And the road like leads to this town that is populated by like other players are in there,

235
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
but they're like role playing as like villagers.

236
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,960
There's this guy called Old Peculiar who is like their, their spirit guy.

237
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,960
And it leads, and it's like, it's like they're playing D&D in Minecraft.

238
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Like these other people are like building all this shit.

239
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,960
They're like building stuff in the game for Lewis and, and Simon to like find as they,

240
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
as they play through, through the game.

241
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Yeah.

242
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,960
And like they, it seems like they don't necessarily know what it is that they're going to be like

243
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,960
seeing that episode, but like, I don't know, stuff is just being built for them to like

244
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
play through an experience in, in this Minecraft world.

245
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,960
It's like the coolest fucking conceit of a, of a series.

246
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

247
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
It's pretty dope.

248
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
That exists.

249
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
It was documented for all to see.

250
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,960
All this fucking gay shit, this mining, this terrarium.

251
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Devil May Cry 5.

252
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,960
The demo finally came out for PS4 and I was playing it nonstop for IM games and after IM games.

253
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
And man, what a great time.

254
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Yeah.

255
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Holy, holy.

256
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Could it be better than Kingdom Hearts 3?

257
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
The greatest action RPG ever made?

258
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Uh, by a landslide, my dude.

259
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Oh, boy.

260
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,960
The combat's great and not floaty and, and, and I don't have to like summon like bumper

261
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,960
cars to do damage to things as well.

262
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Yeah, but can you meet Woody?

263
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Uh, yeah, idiot.

264
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Oh, shit.

265
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Shit.

266
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
But you can get Woody while you're having super fun.

267
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Can you be best friends with Woody the whole time?

268
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm not surprised.

269
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
It was fucking great.

270
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Um, yeah, I'm really, I'm really excited about this game coming out.

271
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Been waiting forever.

272
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Didn't think it was going to be real.

273
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
It's real.

274
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
It's coming next month.

275
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
And holy shit.

276
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,960
It's just, it's everything I ever wanted in a video game.

277
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
It's great.

278
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
You play as Nero.

279
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
You just like three characters.

280
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
The demo had Nero.

281
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
You got the robot arms.

282
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,960
You can like punch people from far away and like there's tons of cool sword combos and

283
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
the boss fight was great and I beat him without getting hit and it was awesome and everybody

284
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
should watch the stream on IM Games because it was a fun, great time.

285
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,960
It was the happiest I've been in years.

286
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Uh, yeah.

287
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Tom enjoying a video game?

288
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,960
It was, it was a rare, it's a rare thing to happen on IM games.

289
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
So like everyone in the chat was just like, this is incredible.

290
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Tom's happy.

291
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
What is going on?

292
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
And I was like, that is great.

293
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I downloaded the demo, but obviously with Kingdom Hearts 3 stuff, I haven't had a chance to

294
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
play it yet, but I will get to it.

295
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,960
The interesting thing is like, because like now, now that the demo is out, I didn't, I

296
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
didn't want to like spoil too much, but like now that I've just got a taste, I'm just absorbing

297
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,960
all the content that's been like coming out like for previews of the game.

298
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
It's only like a month till it comes out or something, right?

299
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Yeah.

300
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
So it's, I mean, what's to really just spoil anyways at this point, you know, it's not

301
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
like there's a story I give a shit about in the game.

302
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Um, but there's this new character in this game called V and he just looks like Kylo Ren

303
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,960
and he's like a total, you know, edge lord.

304
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
But I was like looking, I was looking into his gameplay because I guess there's gameplay

305
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
trails and stuff for him out now and like the whole.

306
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm just curious, who in the demo can you play as?

307
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
It's only Nero.

308
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
It's only Nero.

309
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
It's just the Nero demo.

310
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
They had it like games, comma, whatever.

311
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Um, but yeah.

312
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
So V is like the interesting thing is he's totally different than any other devil may

313
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,960
cry like character because he doesn't do direct combat.

314
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
He does like, he summons guys.

315
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
He has like three familiars you can summon and they do the fighting.

316
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Um, and I was kind of like weirded out about that.

317
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
He's a Pokemon trainer in DMC.

318
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Yeah.

319
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Yeah.

320
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Exactly.

321
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
He's like a really edgy Pokemon trainer, essentially.

322
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
And I was watching the trailers and it was very weird.

323
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,960
The trailers and it was very like concerning because I'm assuming he's going to be like

324
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,960
a third of the game and he moves really slow and like everything's just happening far away

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
from you and he's like a glass cannon.

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
So you get hit too often with him.

327
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
He just dies because he's weak and shit.

328
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
And I was like, this looks like not like what I want out of devil may cry.

329
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
That sounds really scary.

330
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
It just reminded me of chaos legion.

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Have you ever played chaos legion for PS2?

332
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Oh, I have.

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Yeah.

334
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I don't know what it was, but I played a bit.

335
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,960
It's like, it's a game where you basically just summon a bunch of guys.

336
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Like that's considered the game.

337
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You're a summoner and they just fight for you and you kind of just hang back and like

338
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
watch them play.

339
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Okay.

340
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Which I think I remember seeing chaos legion in game and former magazine.

341
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Yeah.

342
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah.

343
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I mean, that's what I saw.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
And then me and Digi played it at one point because you were considering doing it for I am

345
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Games or both like this is boring.

346
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
So that's what I was worried about.

347
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
It's like as a third of my like game of the year just going to be chaos legion.

348
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
But no, I watched, I watched the gameplay demonstration.

349
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
And how it works is that by default you have two summons.

350
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
You have Griffin and you have shadow.

351
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Shadows like this Panther guy.

352
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,960
It's actually like the, the weird shadow cats from Devil May Cry one.

353
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Like one of them is his summon, which is fucking sick.

354
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,960
And then like Griffin's a reference to the boss Griffin from Devil May Cry one.

355
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
And so they replaced the gun and the sword button.

356
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,960
So Griffin is far range attacks and shadow is close range attacks and you control them

357
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
in real time all their combat.

358
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
While you're also controlling B and moving him around.

359
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Imagine if it was Griffin from Berserk and shadow from Hedgehog.

360
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Oh.

361
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Well, now I hate the game because it's not that and not that cool.

362
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Let's get the modding community in on this.

363
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Imagine the bromance.

364
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Dude, those guys, they have the same mentality and the same energy.

365
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
They'd get along swimming with me.

366
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Oh, I think so.

367
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Yeah.

368
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Imagine, by the way, they'd meet as enemies, but they'd fight.

369
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,960
They'd be an even match and then they'd shake hands at the end.

370
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Guys, Sonic, Shadow, Guts, Griffith.

371
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Well, we'll never have that game until someone mods it on PC.

372
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Just out of curiosity, who's the third summon thing?

373
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,960
So your devil trigger replacement is you summon Nightmare,

374
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
which is like this big Golem guy, which is also a boss from Devil May Cry one.

375
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
And eventually you can level up.

376
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,960
So he's just like an NPC guy who walks around and beats the shit out of everybody.

377
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
But you can eventually upgrade him so you can ride him and control him.

378
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I do all this fucking crazy shit.

379
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
And so I guess the way the summons work is they can do damage to enemies,

380
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
but they can't kill them.

381
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
They just put them in a stun state and then you have to teleport it

382
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
and stab them with your cane, and that's how they die.

383
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
So it's like a risk-reward system.

384
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
In order to actually kill things, you have to get close,

385
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
but if you fuck it up, you can get hit.

386
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
You can die instantly because it's so weak.

387
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
So it's a really interesting mechanic system,

388
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
and it seems like there's a lot of complexity to it.

389
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
And so my fears were instantly assuaged.

390
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm like, this looks great.

391
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
I'm totally ready for this.

392
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Oh yeah, it sounds pretty fun.

393
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Yeah.

394
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I have one.

395
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Guys, the Sonic and Shadow,

396
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Guts, Griffith.

397
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Which one's which?

398
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
My god, I can't tell apart.

399
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
They look the same.

400
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Like Sonic, I don't know whether he would be Guts,

401
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
because Sonic's too...

402
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,960
I think Gryphon and Guts are both just Shadow.

403
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I don't know, I feel like Sonic is the Child of Light,

404
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,960
the prophesied one who is the Antichrist,

405
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,960
who is, you know, Sonic is Griffith.

406
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Whereas Shadow is more like Guts,

407
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
because they both live a truly punished existence

408
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
in the darkness and are trying to overthrow, you know,

409
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,960
the evil, light guy that is the other one.

410
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
I don't know.

411
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
That's the best I got.

412
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I just want elaborate fan fiction retelling

413
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
of the story of Berserk, but with Shadow and his Guts.

414
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Dr. Robotnik is definitely,

415
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
what's his name, Void?

416
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Like the leader of the God Hand or whatever.

417
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
No, I'm thinking of the Skull Knight.

418
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Skull Knight would be like Silver or something, I think.

419
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Yeah.

420
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Skull Knight, he's determined to track down the Iblis trigger.

421
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Is Void like the short dwarf looking motherfucker?

422
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
No, that's one of the other ones.

423
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
The one I'm trying to think of is the one with the brain

424
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
outside his head.

425
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Yeah, I remember him.

426
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Who's the big, like, the main first big demon guy

427
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
that keeps coming back?

428
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Oh, that's Zod. You're talking about Zod.

429
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
That's probably chaos from Sonic, you know?

430
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,960
He's Tails.

431
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Oh, yeah, okay.

432
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Is Zod just like a big minotaur, basically?

433
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Yeah, basically.

434
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
No, he has wings, I think, as well.

435
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
He does have wings.

436
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
So he's Tails.

437
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Tails would be Costco.

438
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
You're right.

439
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
When you're right, you're right.

440
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I have one more thing I want to say about Jenny the Juvie.

441
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,960
And that is that to build what's called a slime hutch,

442
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
which is where you breed slimes and have them produce slime balls,

443
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,960
you need a rare mineral called iridium.

444
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
And I didn't have any until a meteor landed on my farm

445
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
and I farmed it for iridium and I got just enough

446
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
to build a slime hutch.

447
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
So this is destiny.

448
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I don't think that ever happened in my fucking, in my game.

449
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I thought it was a scripted event,

450
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,960
but it seems like it's random and I think I got lucky.

451
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I mean, you can get iridium from later in the game,

452
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
like the more advanced mind, which I'm just getting at.

453
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Could this be the influence of Endless War,

454
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
which is inspiring to shape the world?

455
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Some say Endless War came from the skies above.

456
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Others say it came from the ground below.

457
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
No one truly knows.

458
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
So your guess is as good as mine.

459
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I can only speculate.

460
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
One quick thing about Devil May Cry.

461
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
First game, I understand classic, good game.

462
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Second game, shit?

463
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Is that the shit one?

464
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I rented Devil May Cry 2 and I played as the girl

465
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
and it sucks.

466
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
I have the shit one then.

467
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
I have the second one on PS2.

468
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Okay, but can we acknowledge the fact

469
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
that Dante looks the sexiest in Devil May Cry 2?

470
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
By far.

471
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Hold on, let me take a look.

472
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Just take a fucking look.

473
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
It's super fucking cool and it's very hot.

474
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
It's super dope, DMC2 Dante.

475
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
This goes in the show notes.

476
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I was so fucking hyped for that game, seeing those images.

477
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
He's wearing like a vest over his trench coat.

478
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,960
He wears a vest over his coat with a big old collar.

479
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
It's the best he's ever looked.

480
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
He's very...

481
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
It's just like everyone's favorite outfit,

482
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
the coats from Organization XIII.

483
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Which everyone agrees are a masterpiece of design.

484
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Alright, here's my main problem.

485
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
I was looking at them because I was playing Kingdom Hearts 3

486
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,960
after that discussion last episode about the coats.

487
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,960
They are varied and the things I hate the most

488
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
are the flared arm things.

489
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Maxxel has arms that are tight to his arm

490
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
and then he's got gloves and he just looks cool.

491
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
He is cool.

492
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,960
And then Vexxon has like really extremely long sleeves

493
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
that are flared outwards.

494
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,960
They look like they're stupid.

495
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,960
They look like that Kawaii thing of like two long sleeves

496
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
looking up right now.

497
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Extremely, extremely long sleeves and the flared sleeves.

498
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
No, that's Lexius.

499
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Vexxon's the ice guy from Chain of Memories, the scientist.

500
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
He's the replica man.

501
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,960
He's got like the punching dagger thing on his arm.

502
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
I think the problem...

503
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Effectively yes, but it's a shield.

504
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
With the flared arm thing though, is that just a limitation of the PS2?

505
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Because they're supposed to be baggy sleeves

506
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
but the PS2 can't do real time cloth deformation.

507
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,960
So they're just kind of flared out to make it kind of look like they're baggy

508
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
but it sucks and it looks like shit.

509
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,960
That's fair and I don't think in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix

510
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Vexxon had those like overly long sleeves.

511
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I'm having trouble finding like a high res image of every member

512
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
so I can compare.

513
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Here's Axl.

514
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Axl is good. Axl is alright.

515
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Axl looks dope.

516
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,960
But everyone else seems to be including Xemnas.

517
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Axl's on his way to the Gay Rave.

518
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Vexxon is on his way to Science Composite.

519
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah, he owns the leather.

520
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
All these other people, they're just sort of like hiding away from it.

521
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
That's a stupid guy.

522
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,960
His hair looks retarded. I hate that character design.

523
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Look, we all know Vexxon is the ugliest sin.

524
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
I don't like him. He looks dumb.

525
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,960
His face is like weirdly skull-like and unflattering in general.

526
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
He's the ugliest one for sure.

527
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I just don't understand how he has like this long hair

528
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
but it looks like he has long hair

529
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
but he like gelled it around his forehead to go up first

530
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
and then come down.

531
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
I think Lexius is the ugliest one.

532
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,960
I don't like his haircut.

533
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
He gels it.

534
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Guys, guys.

535
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,960
But wait, I like Vexxon because his looks specifically like a robe.

536
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,960
He's like a scientist and his coat looks the most like a robe

537
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
as opposed to like a coat or a jacket.

538
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
I suppose that's fair.

539
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
I just don't like the flares.

540
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
But more importantly,

541
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Which ones are sonics? Which ones are shadows?

542
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,960
They're basically all shadows.

543
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Roxas is a sonic and the rest are all shadows.

544
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
That's fair. Yeah, that's fair.

545
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
You know what, no Larzine.

546
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Larzine's gotta be a sonic.

547
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
She's so mean as fuck.

548
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Does Larzine use light or lightning?

549
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
She's the lightning. She's a lightning one.

550
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Or at Roxas, she's the light one.

551
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
You don't know, no, no, wait, Demix.

552
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Demix plays his sitar and is a canonical radical dude.

553
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
He's gotta be a sonic too.

554
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Demix for sure.

555
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Larzine looks very strange in Kingdom Hearts 3.

556
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
You think so?

557
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
I mean, I just think the aesthetic, like the art design,

558
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,960
is just rather unflattering to every single character.

559
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,960
It may be just that it's unflattering in such high definition

560
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
because look at her boobies.

561
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Look at how weirdly they go.

562
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
They do look weirdly squished and uncomfortable.

563
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
They look like pecs.

564
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
That is unfortunate.

565
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Look how broad her shoulders are.

566
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Right, it's the broad shoulders.

567
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Because she has that V-shaped torso of a jacked dude.

568
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
That is not an attractive build that she has right now.

569
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
No, no, no, no, no.

570
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
That's despicable.

571
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Yeah, yeah, her waist is really tiny,

572
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
but her shoulders are so wide.

573
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Dude.

574
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Her shoulder, she's got that tapered triangle shape.

575
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,960
And her arms, maybe it's just the robe,

576
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
but her arms look really thick.

577
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,960
It's not, though, because her arms are coming out from like,

578
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
it's not like she has like big shoulder pads or something.

579
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Her arms are coming out from that area.

580
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

581
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,960
She just has disgustingly inhumanly broad shoulders

582
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
and I'm repulsed.

583
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Okay, you're right guys, but let's get off this whole visual discussion

584
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
because this is not to the strength of our audio show here.

585
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Okay, despite it being in the show notes.

586
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Hey, on the subject of Kingdom Hearts 3,

587
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,960
I have beaten it, have beaten it, and that was cool.

588
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
And I'm going to be making a video about it shortly,

589
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
but I thought it'd be fun.

590
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,960
This is seeing people's reaction to Kingdom Hearts 3

591
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,960
as such a landmark release from a formerly great company

592
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,960
like Square Enix, or Square, I suppose, whatever,

593
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Square Enix produced Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix,

594
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
so I guess it's the greatest company that ever lived.

595
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,960
But listen to my boy, Leffen.

596
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I read this on my stream yesterday.

597
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Leffen, who is basically the sixth god of melee,

598
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
he's the godslayer, whatever.

599
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
So this is like one of the big guys,

600
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
competitive Smash and whatnot.

601
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Listen to...

602
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Okay, so he played Kingdom Hearts 3, alright.

603
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
He has played none of the other games.

604
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Just listen to his comment from February 8th,

605
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
on his experience of...

606
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Wait, where was this comment?

607
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
On Twitter, this is on Twitter.

608
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
At TSM underscore Leffen.

609
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Okay, there you go.

610
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Alright, listen to this, here we go.

611
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Kingdom Hearts 3 is an actual 3 out of 10 game.

612
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
I haven't played the prior games,

613
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
but honestly, I'm happy I didn't,

614
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,960
because waiting 13 years for a story and gameplay

615
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
this garbage would have fucking ended me.

616
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Graphics, dialogue, combat, it's all shit.

617
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Cut scenes and VA?

618
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Shit.

619
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Cost $70, LMFAO.

620
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
I mean, he's on point.

621
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
He's...

622
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Okay, guys like you, Tom, I get it.

623
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
And like, Dunkey made a video that I have gone out of my way

624
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,960
to not watch, because I don't want to watch until I made my first video,

625
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
where Leffen says later, like,

626
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
well, Dunkey agrees with me.

627
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
So I'm gathering that like,

628
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
to people who have not played like every game in this,

629
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,960
I did play all of them, and even I don't like it.

630
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
In...

631
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Well, whatever, I don't want to get into it too much here,

632
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
but it's just like, I certainly understand

633
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
why people find the story.

634
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Well, here's the thing, and as someone who's played all the games

635
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
and has finished 3, maybe you'll agree with me,

636
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I feel like this game is for the fans who are knee-deep in it,

637
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
and that's it.

638
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Like, it doesn't seem...

639
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
It doesn't seem like the narrative is even like,

640
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
comprehensible, unless you're like a scholar like yourself,

641
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,960
and I think the gameplay is just...

642
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
I don't know.

643
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I don't think the gameplay is good, but I think you can deal with it,

644
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
because like, you're just emotionally invested at that point,

645
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
and you want to slot through.

646
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
That's true, and the fact of the matter is,

647
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
while I know the lore, I am no longer emotionally invested.

648
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
You know what, I'm emotionally invested

649
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,960
with everything that happened up to Kingdom Hearts 2

650
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
and a little bit beyond.

651
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
But everything that happened beyond that,

652
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Dream Drop Distance, the mobile game,

653
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
and a bunch of stuff after that, I just don't care about,

654
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
and it's totally boring and uninteresting.

655
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm aware of what's happening,

656
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
but I have no emotional attachment.

657
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
I like Aqua a little bit, I like She-On a little bit,

658
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
of course like Roxas and those guys,

659
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
but beyond that, there's like...

660
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Leffen's comment here makes 100% sense to me.

661
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Even I would happily say,

662
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,960
the cutscenes are directed like dog shit.

663
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
You don't, and this is what babbles me the most,

664
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
no matter how bad your lore is,

665
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
no matter how convoluted or fucked up

666
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
the actual narrative has become,

667
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,960
at no point do you have to direct your cutscenes like garbage.

668
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
They did that in addition,

669
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
and I just don't know why they did that.

670
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
I guess because it's a baby game,

671
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
and they felt they needed to give us 5 seconds

672
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
in between character speaking,

673
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
so we could catch up with our retarded slow brains.

674
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't know.

675
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
It's strange that it took so long

676
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
for this game to come out,

677
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
and they didn't anticipate that the fanbase

678
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,960
had also grown about the same amount of years

679
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
in that time span.

680
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I was 15 when I played Kingdom Hearts 2

681
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
and fell in love with it at the first time,

682
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
and now I am 28,

683
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
and that is a big fucking difference.

684
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
You know what?

685
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I know we were making this comparison for the lulls,

686
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
but seriously, the cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3

687
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
from what little I've seen

688
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
feel like something out of Sonic Adventure 1,

689
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
where it's just really stilted dialogue

690
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
and odd pauses.

691
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I don't know if you're familiar enough with that game

692
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
to know what I'm talking about.

693
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
I mean, Kingdom Hearts 1 also had that,

694
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
and Kingdom Hearts 2.

695
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,960
But back in the day, that would have been more acceptable.

696
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Absolutely true. Plus, it was a relative...

697
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
I mean, it wasn't an early PS2 game,

698
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
but it was the PS2 era.

699
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,960
We were all more accepting of those sorts of things,

700
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
and it's just, was this a stylistic choice

701
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,960
to keep the kind of pacing of the old games?

702
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I mean, this is the thing that I give...

703
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I want to criticize the game for.

704
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,960
There is a concerted effort in terms of gameplay.

705
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
They have absolutely sacrificed

706
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
responsiveness of controls

707
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
and tight gaminess,

708
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
something that I'm sure Devil May Cry 5,

709
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
hopefully, I haven't actually played it,

710
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
has not done.

711
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Oh, it's cool.

712
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Well, great.

713
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
But, like, here's just one example.

714
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
When you turn around...

715
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
I know I've talked about this before.

716
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
When you turn around in Kingdom Hearts 3,

717
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Sora does a big whole, like, walk around

718
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
step, step, step animation.

719
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
It's not just an instant boom, character flipped,

720
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
facing the other direction.

721
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
And that function has actually made it very hard

722
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
to stand in particular places on ledges

723
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
to do some of the things I was trying to do

724
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
with, like, lucky emblem pictures and stuff.

725
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
And it's...

726
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,960
So all this sacrificing for realism,

727
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,960
and yet the cutscenes are just dog shit

728
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
in terms of, like, editing.

729
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I don't know.

730
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I could improve every cutscene in the game

731
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
if you just gave it to me to edit them down

732
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
to just the dialogue and cut out the space.

733
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
It's very weird.

734
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I mean, I didn't get very far into it, obviously,

735
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
because, like, I was telling you, I think yesterday,

736
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
we were talking about how I want to play everything.

737
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
You should make a Kingdom Hearts story abridged.

738
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
You should just, like, make a shortened version

739
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
that is not...

740
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
The fan edit.

741
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah.

742
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I mean, people...

743
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Oh, you mean, like, take the actual cutscenes

744
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
and, like...

745
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Yeah, like, splice it all together,

746
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
edit it to be more bearable.

747
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
That is not a bad idea.

748
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
You can probably get a lot of views from that.

749
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
And you know what?

750
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Some people have done things where, like, there's this guy,

751
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
I forget his name,

752
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
someone has taken, like, every cutscene

753
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
in all of Kingdom Hearts

754
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
and, like, strung them together

755
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
in a, like, chronological sequence.

756
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Yeah, to make, like, Kingdom Hearts the movie.

757
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Is that like an autism test?

758
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,960
If you make it through that, like, you're certified autistic?

759
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I mean, even I haven't made it through,

760
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,960
like, every single piece of, like, the un-chained key,

761
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
like, the mobile game stuff.

762
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm up to date on everything that matters, but, like...

763
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Is that the un-chained key or the un-chained key?

764
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,960
This is actually the un-chained key.

765
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
I thought so.

766
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
I thought it might be.

767
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Yes, indeed.

768
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
They also call it un-chained cross, but whatever.

769
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
So, yeah, I mean, an abridged thing

770
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,960
would serve the world greatly.

771
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I mean, you know, you got Barry Cramer with his videos

772
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
just to summarize the story,

773
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
but I mean, he doesn't talk about the mobile game,

774
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
at least not very much.

775
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
You know what? Whatever. Who cares?

776
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
That's all I want to say.

777
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
And you know what?

778
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Despite everything I'm saying here to be critical,

779
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
I absolutely do not hate Kingdom Hearts 3

780
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,960
and did have a good time overall

781
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
and am excited to do the end-game content,

782
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
like, get the ultimate weapon and whatnot.

783
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
So, you know, it's not a, not a shit game or anything,

784
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
but I'm gonna get into my details in my Weagua,

785
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,960
hopefully coming up either before this comes out

786
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
or maybe a couple days after. We'll see.

787
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
We'll see.

788
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Yeah.

789
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Oh, yeah, buddy.

790
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Hey, you know, since this is, like, a gaming-themed episode,

791
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
I may as well, like, continue that.

792
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Ben, you did a whole big gaming...

793
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Yeah.

794
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Very recently.

795
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
A huge gaming.

796
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
I was talking about, I was gonna say, like,

797
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
speaking of streaming before, but then we got off the topic.

798
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Yeah, yesterday I did my 24-hour continuous stream

799
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
to celebrate hitting 1,000 followers

800
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
on twitch.tv slash saint comics.

801
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
How'd it go?

802
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
And Hippo, you showed up and raided me,

803
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Nate, you showed up and raided me after a minor kerfuffle,

804
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
but it was fine.

805
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I tried to raid someone called Ben Saint,

806
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
but apparently there's another Ben Saint.

807
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I don't think there is a...

808
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Wait, is there someone called Ben Saint?

809
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Yeah, he brought me to a different page, I think,

810
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
when I did it.

811
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Wait, really? Okay.

812
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
I think so.

813
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Well, then when you raided, wouldn't it have, like,

814
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
okay, because you eventually did raid me

815
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,960
with a party of, like, 40 or something.

816
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Yeah, yeah.

817
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
And so if you had raided someone else,

818
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I would have thought that all your followers,

819
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
or all the people watching would have gone there

820
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
and you wouldn't have been able to raid anymore.

821
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
You know, I'm not an expert.

822
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
It was my first time ever raiding.

823
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I think they have to, like, opt into the raid or something.

824
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh, yeah.

825
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Or maybe it's because they weren't...

826
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Also, I'm creeped out that there's someone

827
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
called Ben Saint on twitch.

828
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I don't like that.

829
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah, I know, I know.

830
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm saint comics with an X.

831
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Indeed.

832
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
But, yeah, that was cool.

833
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
It was really great.

834
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
It was really tired.

835
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Okay, so I had decided to do a 24-hour maple story stream

836
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
for the meme because maple story is a horrible Korean grind fest.

837
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,960
And I was like, what's the worst game that I could play

838
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
for 24 hours?

839
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
I'll do that.

840
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,960
And so that, I know, I made it like 10 hours.

841
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I made it like 10 hours of maple story.

842
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
And then the game crashed and I couldn't bear it anymore.

843
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
So I didn't start it up again.

844
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I defined mercy given to you.

845
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,960
There was a guy in the stream, Zad, who...

846
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah, that was Zad.

847
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Yeah, he came...

848
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
He had, like, thousands of hours logged in maple story.

849
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,960
And he showed up as one of his characters

850
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
and was showed up to the maps I was on

851
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,960
and cast spells to make more enemies spawn so I could grind faster.

852
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh, that's nice.

853
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
It was pretty nice, yeah.

854
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
He also advised me.

855
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Apparently one of the servers is for...

856
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
It makes it easier to level.

857
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
It's called the reboot server, I think, or something like that.

858
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
So I had some help.

859
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
But 10 hours in, I was like, I can't do it.

860
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
It was not a fun game to watch, be streamed.

861
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Did you get to the class up at all?

862
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Did you do any of that business?

863
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I got to level 60, but I didn't get a class up.

864
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
I just got a new folder, or I just got a new page

865
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
of skills to start leveling.

866
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Also, I played one of these new classes

867
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,960
that is not a class, it's just a character.

868
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Okay, well, I'm not familiar with that at all.

869
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Mine's name was Kadina or something,

870
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,960
and he was an urban chain warrior from some gang city,

871
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,960
which is pretty cool, I guess.

872
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,960
Back in the day, it was archer, warrior, thief.

873
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Yeah.

874
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I booted this up and I see you could be Kadina,

875
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
a street smart man warrior.

876
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
Oh, I hate that.

877
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
You could be iffy or whatever,

878
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,960
a fucking ice wizard man pair.

879
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
For vice.

880
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Yeah.

881
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,960
And so I was like, boy, MapleStory sure has changed

882
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,960
in the 12 years since the last time I played it.

883
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Yep.

884
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Yep.

885
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Anyway, so I switched to Return of the Overdinn,

886
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
which my friend John got for me.

887
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
It was really cool.

888
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,960
I played the demo of it when it came out a couple years ago.

889
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I played...

890
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
It was sick, and it played sick,

891
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
and I really liked the visual aesthetic.

892
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I spent like 12 hours playing Overdinn.

893
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
I played the entire game.

894
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,960
I solved every character's fate I found.

895
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I got the good ending.

896
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,960
I got 100% of it right in the...

897
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Well, I went like slightly over 24 hours

898
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,960
because I just wanted to finish it and get the good ending.

899
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
And that was really fun.

900
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
It proved to be a way more interesting game to stream.

901
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
I thought anyway.

902
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Like 10 hours into MapleStory, I was dying.

903
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
My brain was shutting off.

904
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I was suffering.

905
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
And then I started Overdinn,

906
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,960
and Overdinn engaged my various brain lobes to a degree

907
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
that it was not as painful to continue.

908
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Thank God.

909
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Yeah.

910
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,960
I was thinking about how to do a 24-hour stream

911
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
with a single game and not kill yourself.

912
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Like what sort of games could I play

913
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
that would work for that?

914
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Because in the past, I did a stream of Hollow Knight

915
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,960
that just ended up going for 17 hours by accident.

916
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
And so that was a pretty...

917
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
I probably could have done Hollow Knight for 24 hours,

918
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
and it wouldn't have been too bad.

919
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
I was going to say any game with satisfying progression

920
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
that keeps rewarding you with new stuff to find and do

921
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
probably would be terrible.

922
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Yeah.

923
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,960
So because I had done that 17-hour Hollow Knight stream,

924
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I knew that 24 hours was doable and to be fine.

925
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
It was really fun.

926
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,960
And I gained a bunch more followers.

927
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
A bunch of people subscribed.

928
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
A lot of people donated because they were like,

929
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
damn, 24 hours, nice job.

930
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Here's a tip.

931
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,960
And I was like, fuck, yeah.

932
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
All right, sick.

933
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
It was an event.

935
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Getting paid for the pay.

936
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Oh, and A.J. Shoup wrote a song.

937
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Oh, I wanted to play that.

938
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
It wasn't loading on my fucking phone before.

939
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
I tweeted it after the stream.

940
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,960
A.J. Shoup wrote a song that is just about how Ben St. has

941
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
got to 1,000 followers today.

942
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
And it's really good.

943
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
It's great.

944
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
He made the whole thing in like a couple hours

945
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
while the stream was going.

946
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,960
He was just like, I will be back.

947
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
I will start a song right now and come back

948
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
with a fully realized piece of music.

949
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
And he did.

950
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
What a legend.

951
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Yeah.

952
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,960
You know, I looked at my follow account

953
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,960
and I somehow have more than 1,000 already.

954
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
And I don't know how because I get like,

955
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,960
20 viewers per stream when I stream.

956
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
I stream all the time though.

957
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
I don't know.

958
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I mean, because the stream went on for so long,

959
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
I wasn't getting like my huge numbers.

960
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I get, I'll get like 50 to 60 on a normal stream.

961
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
This time I was averaging like 40 ish or so

962
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
throughout the whole like 24 hours.

963
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
I really, I am very envious of you, Nate,

964
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
that you're getting that you were getting numbers

965
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,960
that are reaching the point where you could hit partner.

966
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm not doing it.

967
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm finally there.

968
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I just, it's just, I don't stream enough to fucking

969
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
actually be a partner.

970
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
You've got to be getting like 75.

971
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
75 is the average number you want to hit.

972
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
And I'm like probably like 50 or something.

973
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,960
My, my, you know, even while I was doing the Pokemon thing,

974
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,960
like my numbers were not at a level that were above that.

975
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
But it was like the finale of the Pokemon thing

976
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
was a big event that a lot of people came out for.

977
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
And then ever since then it's been like,

978
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
I don't know if it, I'm curious if it's due

979
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,960
to the goodwill generated by how dope the finale was

980
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,960
or if it was just that people aren't like,

981
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
they're a glad we're not doing Pokemon anymore.

982
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
So they're actually willing to watch.

983
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,960
I do not know which it is.

984
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,960
In any case, I'm definitely going to do another fucking

985
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Nuzlocke at some point.

986
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
So get ready, people.

987
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Heart gold.

988
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
It's coming.

989
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
One of these days.

990
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,960
The best game ever made of Pokemon.

991
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Oh my God.

992
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Yeah, hippo.

993
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
You got the, you got almost 1300 and I didn't realize.

994
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Yeah, I don't even, I don't even know how.

995
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I guess maybe from the couple times I mentioned it

996
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,960
on Hippocrite when it was like the Heroes of Might

997
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
and Magic streams and I did a couple of those.

998
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
That's possible.

999
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Maybe, yeah.

1000
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Hey, do you guys want to hear about my tale of epic agony

1001
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
and pain that I experienced the other day?

1002
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Yeah.

1003
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,960
It was pretty dope.

1004
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Okay, so there's, this is, this is a,

1005
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
there's a hilarious ending to this, but okay.

1006
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,960
So, so on like Friday morning at like 5 a.m.

1007
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,960
I wake up with a horrible pain in my gut

1008
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
because the previous night on Thursday,

1009
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,960
I had done like a seven or eight hour gauntlet

1010
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,960
finishing Kingdom Hearts 3,

1011
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
getting all the way from like the last world

1012
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,960
being that to all the end game stuff,

1013
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
which does take an eternity.

1014
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
So I finally beat the game at the end

1015
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
and while I was doing my epic gamer sesh,

1016
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
I thought I'd be a really healthy boy.

1017
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,960
So I had a gigantic bag of carrots in front of me.

1018
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
So I was just eating those, like little baby carrots,

1019
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
but there were so many and I ate the entire bag

1020
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,960
over the course of several hours.

1021
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Uh-oh.

1022
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Um, so I did that and there's,

1023
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
they're very fibrous, these carrots, don't you know?

1024
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
But they, they go down real smooth.

1025
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
So I just chowed down.

1026
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
Um, so, so,

1027
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
Wait, these raw carrots?

1028
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,960
These were, yeah, raw baby carrots.

1029
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,960
One, I hate carrots.

1030
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,960
I hate raw carrots.

1031
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
I like them.

1032
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
What can I say?

1033
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,960
I like them like cooked in a soup maybe.

1034
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
Like, but, but like eating them raw,

1035
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,960
like my least favorite vegetable.

1036
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Fair enough.

1037
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
I don't know.

1038
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
I like it way more than something like,

1039
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,960
I don't know.

1040
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
I actually kind of like most vegetables.

1041
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,960
I don't like,

1042
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,960
I do like a lot of vegetables.

1043
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Carrots aren't one of them.

1044
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Well, okay, fair enough.

1045
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Anyway.

1046
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
They're my, they're my, they're my kryptonite.

1047
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Fair enough.

1048
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,960
So I, uh, uh, wake up the next morning at like 5 a.m.

1049
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Pain, horrible, sucks, try to shit, can't.

1050
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,960
I'm like, okay, whatever, go back to sleep.

1051
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Uh, and it's, it's a, it's a pressure, you know,

1052
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,960
a lower gut pressure is building in it.

1053
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Doesn't fiber like make you shit better?

1054
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Okay.

1055
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
What I think more fiber in your diet,

1056
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,960
like gives you more poop,

1057
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,960
which is good for moving things through your digestive system

1058
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
and just generally is good for you.

1059
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
It's literally bulk that you can't digest

1060
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
and just gives you more to shit.

1061
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
And that's like good for you as I understand it.

1062
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
Yeah.

1063
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Yeah.

1064
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
Yeah.

1065
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
But when you, I think when you just eat,

1066
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
when I ate,

1067
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Exactly.

1068
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
But, but it is insoluble.

1069
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
And I think I just ate so much so fast

1070
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
that it just created a plug that just stuck up my guts

1071
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
and nothing was moving.

1072
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
I mean, I couldn't fart.

1073
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
I couldn't shit.

1074
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,960
I was, I was trying to belch to get things to come up the other way.

1075
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
It was not happening.

1076
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,960
I don't know.

1077
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,960
I probably should have tried to puke a little more,

1078
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
but okay, we're just getting started here.

1079
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Sounds like a fate worse than death.

1080
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Well, if it's in your guts already,

1081
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,960
then puking won't do anything, right?

1082
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
Do you do the same thing?

1083
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
That's what I mean, maybe.

1084
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
When you're like stuffed up,

1085
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
do you do the same thing where you're like,

1086
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,960
you can feel it in your gut

1087
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
and you sort of like squish it

1088
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
like as hard as you can with your hands

1089
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,960
and like punch it?

1090
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
Yes.

1091
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
I did try to do that at first.

1092
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,960
Punch it.

1093
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,960
I mean, I literally did that

1094
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
and I thought that I should maybe try to go for a run

1095
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
to like shake it loose,

1096
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
which I was too much of a pussy.

1097
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
I let the pain beat me down

1098
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
and I didn't go do that.

1099
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,960
I probably would have been better off if I did,

1100
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,960
because okay, here's what happened.

1101
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
So I wake up, I'm in pain.

1102
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
I kind of, you know, like I'm supposed to be at work.

1103
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
I'm like, guys, I'm in a lot of pain.

1104
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
I'm gonna come back later.

1105
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
So I'm out.

1106
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,960
I feel a little better as the day goes on

1107
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,960
and here's where I make a tragic mistake.

1108
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,960
So during like the morning meeting at work or whatever,

1109
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,960
like I, for some reason,

1110
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
I come to the conclusion,

1111
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,960
despite knowing about this whole carrot thing

1112
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,960
and feeling in horrible pain all morning,

1113
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
it has started to abate.

1114
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,960
So I say to Michelle, Michelle, I've got it.

1115
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
I think what this might just be is,

1116
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
so carrots aren't super satisfying.

1117
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I think these are just hunger pains.

1118
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
So what I need to do

1119
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,960
is just eat tons of food really fast

1120
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
and that will cure this pain.

1121
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Sometimes you don't know what a feeling is.

1122
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
That's true.

1123
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
It's absolutely true.

1124
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,960
And I incorrectly deduced

1125
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,960
that this was actually secret hunger pains.

1126
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,960
So we order, I got a gigantic, fully loaded,

1127
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,960
tuna sub from Subway.

1128
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,960
And like, cause I am quite hungry.

1129
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,960
So I down that thing in like 30 seconds

1130
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,960
and all of a sudden the pressure is back on

1131
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,960
worse than it was by a significant amount before.

1132
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,960
And from then on, it's something like a 12 hour gauntlet

1133
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,960
of me writhing on the ground, like in my bed,

1134
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,960
just attempting to shake my ass loose.

1135
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
But nothing is happening.

1136
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Nothing is budging.

1137
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Nothing is moving in any way.

1138
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,960
And I'm, Michelle is in the other room

1139
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
enjoying the nice snowy day.

1140
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Well, I'm writhing.

1141
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
She's going, ah!

1142
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Ah!

1143
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Ah!

1144
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,960
I'm literally doing this the entire day.

1145
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,960
So at around, it's at 10 p.m.

1146
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,960
after all the urgent care centers have closed.

1147
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,960
So all that's left is the ER.

1148
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,960
And at this point, I have hit my breaking point.

1149
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,960
I am getting the shakes.

1150
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
I'm getting the sweats.

1151
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
And I'm not sure how much longer I can last.

1152
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
Just enduring this.

1153
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
I was hoping it would just go away.

1154
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,960
But I'm like, Michelle, I need to go to the hospital.

1155
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Let's go.

1156
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
I'm going to die.

1157
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
I am.

1158
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
I mean, the only, nothing had felt like actual death.

1159
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,960
It was just pain of a, I would say it was like

1160
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
a five or six out of 10.

1161
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
But for an entire day, I just was like,

1162
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,960
my HP bar has to be low at this point.

1163
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
And I'm running low on few.

1164
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
I don't have any potions.

1165
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
So we get to the ER.

1166
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
And so we're there.

1167
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,960
They do, they signed me in to do my blood work.

1168
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,960
I'm there for a total of five hours before the doctor

1169
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,960
actually sees me at like 2 a.m.

1170
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
or whatever.

1171
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,960
It was, I mean, they said it was particularly bad day.

1172
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,960
It's always forever.

1173
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
I mean, that's why you go to urgent care.

1174
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Don't go to the ER people.

1175
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Just unless it's a true emergency,

1176
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
then they will prioritize you.

1177
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
The life hack is you have to call an ambulance

1178
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,960
because then they'll rush you in immediately.

1179
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
But that cost so much more money.

1180
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Don't you have to pay for that?

1181
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Yeah.

1182
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,960
Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.

1183
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,960
How much five hours would do?

1184
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
I mean, that's a good question.

1185
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,960
I lost my entire day.

1186
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
But so the point is, this is the thing.

1187
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,960
When I get to the hospital, I'm in the worst pain of all.

1188
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,960
It hasn't abated at all.

1189
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
It's sharp, it's constant.

1190
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,960
The pressure, I feel like I'm going to blow

1191
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,960
and I'm worried that my intestines will rupture

1192
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,960
and just nothing's moving.

1193
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
Jesus Christ.

1194
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
Yes.

1195
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,960
And so it was during that five-hour period

1196
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
about four hours into it,

1197
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
as I've gone in, they took my blood,

1198
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,960
they fucking, I don't know, they took my name

1199
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,960
and they asked me a bunch of questions and shit.

1200
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
As I'm finally getting close to seeing the doctor,

1201
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,960
I go to the bathroom and praise God almighty.

1202
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,960
There is some movement.

1203
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
There is some movement.

1204
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
I do a bit of a shit

1205
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,960
and there is some gaseous release.

1206
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,960
So it didn't have anything.

1207
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,960
They didn't do anything for you at the hospital.

1208
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
They literally did nothing.

1209
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,960
No.

1210
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Things took so long that nothing happened.

1211
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,960
That the problem just resolved itself

1212
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,960
while you were waiting.

1213
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
It resolved itself.

1214
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Now, I haven't gotten any kind of like bill yet.

1215
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
I mean, I have insurance.

1216
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
So like, it's probably going to be something, I imagine.

1217
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
But like, I don't know.

1218
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,960
I was happy to be there just to feel like,

1219
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,960
okay, no, if I collapse here,

1220
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,960
I will not die.

1221
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
So that's good.

1222
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,960
Yeah, they'll give me emergency surgery

1223
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
if needed.

1224
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Indeed, if needed, if necessary.

1225
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
But it did not help.

1226
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
A lot of parent out of your guts.

1227
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
Indeed, exactly.

1228
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,960
But I mean, so by the time I finally saw the doctor,

1229
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,960
the pressure was down from like,

1230
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,960
I don't know, like 90% intolerable

1231
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
just because it's going on so long.

1232
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
That was like 10%.

1233
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,960
And it was just feeling way fucking better.

1234
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
And so whatever.

1235
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,960
They gave me like a medicine to like help with like,

1236
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,960
fucking a laxative or whatever.

1237
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Just to help in general.

1238
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,960
But by this point,

1239
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,960
the problem had basically fixed itself.

1240
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,960
I go home and I'm feeling fine.

1241
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,960
Things are okay.

1242
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
But yesterday.

1243
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
This is the amazing part.

1244
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,960
I message Digi.

1245
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,960
And we do the Shield Hero podcast.

1246
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
And Digi is just like,

1247
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
so Nate, I heard you were sick.

1248
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,960
Like what happened?

1249
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,960
And I tell him that whole story.

1250
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
And he's like, dude,

1251
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,960
that exact same thing happened to me

1252
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,960
like one month ago or whatever.

1253
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,960
And I wrote a song about it.

1254
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,960
And it's here linked in the show notes.

1255
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Who was this?

1256
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Digi.

1257
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,960
So MLP wrote a song about the exact same experience

1258
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
that he experienced.

1259
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
It's called Boiling Guts.

1260
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Go listen to it.

1261
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,960
It's the banger of the century.

1262
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,960
It completely encapsulates artistically

1263
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,960
the experience that I went through

1264
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,960
and Digi apparently did as well.

1265
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Just listen to that.

1266
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
10 pound brick in my colon.

1267
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Man, imagine when it's going to drop,

1268
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,960
going to part the ocean.

1269
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
But oh shit.

1270
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
There's no shit coming out.

1271
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Rub this tummy down.

1272
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Squeeze me out like some cheese whiz.

1273
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Feeling like a geek kid sitting here an hour.

1274
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Going both before and after the shower.

1275
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Fist clenched going Super Saiyan trying to power.

1276
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,960
And it just goes on.

1277
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,960
It just goes on.

1278
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
This is everything that I felt.

1279
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
Beautiful.

1280
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
It was incredible.

1281
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Oh, and that reminds me.

1282
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
There was one other facet.

1283
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,960
I almost forgot about this hospital experience,

1284
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
which was while we were there,

1285
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,960
there was a family with a bunch of young kids.

1286
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,960
They were just like listening to loud,

1287
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,960
like YouTube auto-recommended playlist music.

1288
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
And that was fine.

1289
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
But then, all of a sudden,

1290
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
one song, one fateful song comes on.

1291
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
It's, I am not afraid of puppeteers.

1292
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,960
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1293
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,960
It just comes up like,

1294
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
comes on like the radio?

1295
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,960
Well, they're playing on their iPad loudly.

1296
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Like for all to hear, no shame.

1297
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
There's no attempt to, you know,

1298
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
not annoy everybody else.

1299
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,960
And then they finally get to that triumphant chorus

1300
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
and it keeps going,

1301
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
discard!

1302
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
I'm howling at the moon,

1303
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,960
I'm sleeping in the middle of a Sunday afternoon.

1304
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
They did it.

1305
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,960
Was it before or after?

1306
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,960
This is pre or post-shit.

1307
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,960
This was while I was in my most intense agony.

1308
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,960
So was this like a fever dream?

1309
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
You were like afraid that you were actually

1310
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
the hallucination?

1311
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
At like 1 a.m. at night.

1312
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
I'm writhing.

1313
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,960
I think he hallucinated.

1314
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,960
I think he hallucinated.

1315
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,960
This sounds like a hallucination.

1316
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,960
This doesn't seem real.

1317
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,960
It was sympathy hallucinations.

1318
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Oh my God.

1319
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,960
And so that's the complete saga.

1320
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm fine now.

1321
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,960
Thanks for asking.

1322
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,960
You should have wrapped T-Bab.

1323
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
They obviously were bronies.

1324
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
You should be like,

1325
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
if you guys are going to watch T-Bab,

1326
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,960
it's good.

1327
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,960
Subscribe to T-Bab, guys!

1328
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,960
I could imagine in your head you'd be like,

1329
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
oh yeah, I'm going to howl at the moon

1330
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
just for five minutes.

1331
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,960
I've been howling at the moon all night.

1332
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
So there you go.

1333
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
It was interesting.

1334
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,960
It was probably the worst pain I felt

1335
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
all day in my life.

1336
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,960
Oh, and I almost forgot.

1337
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,960
On the way in, as I'm stumbling in,

1338
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
like writhing in agony,

1339
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Michelle's like helping me get inside.

1340
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,960
There's just like some lady who's just like,

1341
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,960
excuse me, y'all, can y'all spare some change?

1342
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Like, I got to get the bus in a couple of minutes.

1343
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,960
I got to get a taxi to get home.

1344
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Like, to me, as I'm dying of agony,

1345
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
stumbling into this ER at like,

1346
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,960
I guess at that point it was like 11 p.m. or something.

1347
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
Needless to say, did not.

1348
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
Definitely a good place to find really sympathetic songs

1349
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,960
going into the hospital with medical problems.

1350
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
Indeed, indeed.

1351
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Okay, there you go.

1352
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,960
There's the complete saga.

1353
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
It was fun.

1354
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
It was legendary.

1355
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
It was pretty good.

1356
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
Yeah, good time.

1357
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,960
How would you rate the experience?

1358
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
I had a great time.

1359
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
It was, you know, pretty fun.

1360
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
I mean, it was better than, I don't know,

1361
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,960
being, I don't know,

1362
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,960
something worse, I guess.

1363
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Yeah, better than being gay.

1364
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
They got that gay gene out of me.

1365
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
The surgery was a success, everybody.

1366
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
I could get last.

1367
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Oh, fuck.

1368
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Hot dog.

1369
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Well, what's next on the docket?

1370
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
I'm out.

1371
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
We got some hot boys here.

1372
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
I want to talk about the greatest item I've purchased

1373
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,960
in a long time, which is my new iPad.

1374
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
Holy fuck.

1375
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
Yeah.

1376
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,960
I bought this on the recommendation of my sister,

1377
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,960
who is a professional user experience designer.

1378
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
She's real.

1379
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,960
She makes like real money, has like real things.

1380
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Great.

1381
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Dope.

1382
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,960
So she's like, we meet up sometimes at Starbucks

1383
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
because like the traffic to get back to where she like...

1384
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,960
To do a quick Q&A at Starbucks.

1385
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,960
Yeah, a quick Q&A.

1386
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,960
And we'll just hang out.

1387
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,960
And she's like, you got to check out this iPad.

1388
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,960
I just got it recently and it's like changed my life.

1389
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,960
I'm like, really?

1390
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,960
And she got the base like cheap iPad and the Apple Pencil.

1391
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,960
She's like, it's so much better to draw on than anything.

1392
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,960
And I'm like, that's fucking bullshit, no way.

1393
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,960
And I tried it and it was like legitimately great.

1394
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,960
And I was like, all right, all right, this is pretty cool.

1395
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Because I was thinking about trying to get back into drawing

1396
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,960
just to like post stuff on Twitter and shit in between.

1397
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,960
Like working on games and 3D.

1398
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Wasn't the plan to like promote Izumi by doing a bunch of art

1399
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
for it for like a month there?

1400
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,960
Yeah.

1401
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,960
And I have like, you know, my little tablet I have left

1402
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
from like all the stuff I had from Rebel Pixels.

1403
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
And it's just not that great.

1404
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,960
It's fine to draw in, but it's not great, you know?

1405
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
It's not like a Waycom Sintique or anything.

1406
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,960
So I was like, well, this seems cool.

1407
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,960
I'll give it a shot.

1408
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,960
And I bought it and it legitimately is like the best drawing device

1409
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
I've ever used.

1410
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Like, because like the weird thing is that, I mean, Ben,

1411
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
you and Gib, you've used Waycom device before.

1412
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
You know how they have like the hover.

1413
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,960
So like you're over the screen or you're over the tablet

1414
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,960
and like it shows the cursor and you can hover the pen around.

1415
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,960
This doesn't have hover.

1416
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,960
So I thought that'd be really weird to know where I placed the pen

1417
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,960
to like close lines and stuff, but you don't need it.

1418
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,960
It's so accurate.

1419
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,960
It just feels like using an actual pencil.

1420
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
It's incredible.

1421
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,960
Wow.

1422
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,960
There's this app called Procreate, which is like apparently,

1423
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,960
despite having a terrible name that sounds like, you know, reproduction,

1424
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,960
like it's replaced like Waycom Sintique and like in like professional artists.

1425
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,960
Like it's like the number one thing that like professionals use to draw

1426
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,960
now apparently.

1427
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,960
And so I'm using it and it's the stabilizer built in is incredible.

1428
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
The brush engine is amazing.

1429
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
The accuracy is supreme.

1430
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,960
And it's like, I got this whole setup like the pencil,

1431
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,960
the iPad with 128 gigs of storage, a cover and a keyboard for like 400 bucks.

1432
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,960
And it blows away anything I've ever used before.

1433
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,960
It's like the best drawing device in the world except for probably

1434
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,960
the more expensive iPads.

1435
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,960
It costs like four times as much, but like it's insanely good.

1436
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,960
How big is the screen?

1437
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
The screen is 10 inches.

1438
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,960
So this is a very small one, but I'm finding that it's for me, it's fine.

1439
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
I have no problem with the size because here's the interesting thing.

1440
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Before I've never like used like rotating the canvas or anything

1441
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,960
because like usually to do that in Photoshop or Clip Studio is like,

1442
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
you have to drag a slider and it's really annoying.

1443
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,960
And none of the pen displays I've ever used have multi-touch because it's like

1444
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,960
really expensive because it's been like three grand on a Sintique for that.

1445
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,960
Since this has multi-touch, it's super easy to just zoom in,

1446
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,960
rotate the canvas really easy and always have your pencil like,

1447
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,960
like the stroke angle being right in aligned with your wrist because it's so easy to do.

1448
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,960
So I'm rotating my canvas now constantly.

1449
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
I mean, I rotate my canvas constantly.

1450
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,960
I've never done that before because it was just too much of a hassle.

1451
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,960
So like this is so fucking transformative.

1452
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Like the quality and the ease of use and the multi-touch, I'm a changed man.

1453
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,960
This has changed my life and I'm going to evangelize it.

1454
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Everybody should get an iPad to draw on.

1455
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
It's better than anything.

1456
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,960
I mean, I've pretty much fully transitioned.

1457
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,960
I don't eat my Wacom bamboo, which I held.

1458
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,960
I had the Sintique that Arthramus gave me for like a year and I hardly used it

1459
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,960
because I was just accustomed to my Wacom bamboo, $50 piece of shit,

1460
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,960
like six inch like surface area.

1461
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
But it finally, it was like broke.

1462
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Like it kept like disconnecting and reconnecting like the connector was spotty

1463
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960
and like I couldn't keep using it.

1464
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,960
So I pretty much completely transitioned to the Sintique and it's been painless

1465
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,960
and I feel dumb that I didn't do it earlier.

1466
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Like it's not that it does anything that I couldn't do before, but like, I don't know.

1467
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,960
I found that when I made the leap and I finally just like took the Sintique

1468
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,960
and put it like front and center on my desk, like this is what I use now.

1469
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Like this is my main monitor.

1470
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,960
I found that it was like easier to draw.

1471
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,960
The creature conference are just like, you don't really expect them to be that much better

1472
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,960
until you kind of get used to it.

1473
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,960
And then going back, you're just like, ugh, ugh.

1474
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,960
The one thing, psychologically having my Wacom as my main monitor

1475
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,960
just like made me like, just like incline me to draw more readily, you know?

1476
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
Yeah, definitely.

1477
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,960
Good stuff.

1478
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,960
I draw way more now because it's so easy to just like,

1479
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,960
because like there's no booting up an app or like booting up the computer or anything.

1480
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
I just like open the cover.

1481
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,960
It's on.

1482
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,960
You use touch ID to log in the apps right there and I just go and it feels great and I love it.

1483
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,960
It's amazing and everybody should buy it.

1484
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,960
I'm going to praise it from the rooftops.

1485
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,960
It's totally worth it.

1486
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,960
I'll think about it.

1487
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
How much was it?

1488
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,960
Well, I got this one.

1489
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,960
The thing is like I was kind of dumb because I know they're going to replace this model

1490
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,960
that I bought with a new one in like two months,

1491
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
but that does mean it's like on sale everywhere right now.

1492
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,960
So I got it for $100 off, brand new.

1493
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,960
So it was $300 for the iPad, the pencil I got for 70.

1494
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,960
And then I just also got a cover to protect the screen,

1495
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,960
but altogether it was like less than 400 bucks.

1496
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,960
And you could get it cheaper because I got the 128 gig model,

1497
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,960
which I didn't even really need and get a 32 gig one for even cheaper.

1498
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,960
So like $270 gets you the iPad, the pencil you need.

1499
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,960
That's another like 50 to 70 if you get it online and you're good to go.

1500
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,960
It's totally worth it.

1501
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,960
I have my mom's old iPad and I've been trying,

1502
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,960
I've been thinking like trying to use it for, you know, for my own purposes,

1503
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,960
but it's sort of like locked into her account.

1504
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,960
I don't know how to like factory reset it.

1505
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,960
But if I could figure out how to do that, I could buy the pencil maybe.

1506
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,960
I don't know, this is a pretty old iPad.

1507
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,960
Yeah, the problem is you have to get either the sixth generation,

1508
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,960
like the current iPad, the base iPad or the iPad Pro.

1509
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Those are the only ones that work with the pencil.

1510
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,960
The older ones don't, which sucks because I had an older iPad as well.

1511
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,960
Because I had an iPad mini back in like 2013.

1512
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,960
I got the one with LTE to replace my phone because I just,

1513
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,960
my phone broke and I wanted an iPad anyway.

1514
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,960
So I just like got an app that let you make phone calls and just use that for everything.

1515
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,960
So I was like this weirdo with this big iPad walking around and that was my phone.

1516
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,960
I have a little headset if I need to talk to people.

1517
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,960
Man, some people do that.

1518
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,960
It's the most awkward thing to see.

1519
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,960
I mean, I never, I made phone calls like even then, like never.

1520
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
So I was just texting and it was fine.

1521
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
It's a bigger screen to have more text on the screen.

1522
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,960
And I was using that for everything until Verizon like blocked my phone app

1523
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,960
because they're like, you need to buy a phone plant to use this.

1524
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
I'm like, yeah.

1525
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,960
So that was the end of that.

1526
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,960
But I was even using it for art back then, but there was no Apple pencil.

1527
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,960
So the support was like kind of shitty and you kind of just like finger paint on it.

1528
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,960
It was weird, which was not great.

1529
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,960
So that's why like when the Apple pencil and shit came out and like,

1530
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,960
I don't know, I've tried this whole iPad drawing thing before.

1531
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,960
I'm not convinced, but then I'm a believer now.

1532
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
I'm on it hardcore. Everybody should do it.

1533
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,960
It's great.

1534
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,960
Whoo.

1535
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,960
I'm convinced.

1536
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,960
If only I had any knowledge of drawing whatsoever.

1537
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,960
It's never too late to start.

1538
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Here's what you need to know about drawing.

1539
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,960
Drawing is the act of making a mark on the world.

1540
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Drawing in the dirt, you're an artist.

1541
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,960
What if I draw, you know, in video footage with editing?

1542
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,960
No, it's the one thing that doesn't count.

1543
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,960
If you draw your mouse across the screen, that's art.

1544
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,960
If you draw the curtains, you're moving the curtains, you're creating light.

1545
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,960
You're an artist.

1546
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,960
I'm going to draw my gun and fucking blow your face off.

1547
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,960
That's fair.

1548
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,960
Thanks, Tom. Go to Quick Draw, the new channel, the new drawing channel for art people.

1549
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,960
I didn't even know about Quick Draw. No one told me about it.

1550
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,960
Yeah, no one told me either.

1551
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,960
You've been away. You've been like not paying attention.

1552
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,960
We've been adding people. I guess I suck.

1553
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,960
No, you're in. Just join it and you'll be in.

1554
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,960
You'll be a Quick Drawer.

1555
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,960
I think, hopefully, I have no idea actually.

1556
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,960
No, not that. Hopefully, Munchie will have made the first episode by the time this is out.

1557
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,960
I don't actually know.

1558
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,960
I just want to watch it because I still don't even know what the conceit is.

1559
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,960
It's basically the draw cast.

1560
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,960
It's the draw cast, but it's on the same channel.

1561
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:52,960
We're going to do other kinds of draw challenges, but baseline, the draw cast is moved to the draw.

1562
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,960
This reminded me. One of my favorite things about the iPad in Procreate, which is cool,

1563
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:02,960
is that with Procreate, it automatically records everything you do and saves it as a video file.

1564
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,960
You can do speed draws automatically. You don't have to think about doing it, just does it by itself.

1565
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
That's cool.

1566
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,960
I used to make speed draws and it was annoying.

1567
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,960
It was just really annoying setting up OBS to record my screen.

1568
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,960
That's why I never did it either, but now it just does it.

1569
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,960
You can look at it at any time.

1570
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,960
You can scrub through it and see how things are going.

1571
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,960
At any point, you just export it and then you can use it for anything.

1572
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,960
It's great.

1573
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,960
That's cool. That's very cool.

1574
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,960
We'll do it.

1575
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,960
Anybody want to get to the fucking voicemails?

1576
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,960
Is there anything else we should talk about?

1577
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,960
I'm out. That was my one thing I wanted to evangelize.

1578
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Very good.

1579
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,960
I guess I'm out. My 24-hour stream blew everything else out of my brain.

1580
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,960
Understandable.

1581
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,960
There's nothing else left at the end.

1582
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:00,960
The only thing that I could mention is this silly project that I started.

1583
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,960
You may remember a long time ago on the Give and Take channel, you've got Chainmail,

1584
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,960
where I show the Chainmail bodice torso thing made entirely out of paper clips.

1585
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:19,960
I wear it and it's really cool, made out of at least 2,000 paper clips.

1586
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Epic.

1587
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
What are my favorites?

1588
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Have you been wearing it now?

1589
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,960
Yes, every day.

1590
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:33,960
I always thought I should make some plate mail armor,

1591
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:41,960
some plate armor, and I was gathering cardboard for a while there, months and months and months ago.

1592
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,960
Gathering cardboard, but it was always too thick or too inconsistent and it was hard to cut.

1593
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,960
I was like, this is terrible. This is never going to work.

1594
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,960
But then I had the big brain.

1595
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
The big brain thought.

1596
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,960
Yeah.

1597
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,960
Plate armor, paper plates.

1598
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,960
Yeah. Good.

1599
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,960
I have made, I will take a picture and I will show you.

1600
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:14,960
I have made the gauntlet, one of the gauntlets out of paper plates and paper fasteners.

1601
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,960
I wanted to start with the gauntlet because that's probably the hardest part.

1602
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,960
I don't have enough paper fasteners to finish it, but I have plenty of paper plates and it looks and feels incredible.

1603
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:36,960
It's basically the way to make a gauntlet, I have learned through using hobbyists and things like making forums about all this sort of stuff,

1604
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:46,960
is that you need to have a glove and then you basically staple the pieces on in a certain order from the tip of the finger down so that it curls around.

1605
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,960
My mom and I made a Vincent Valentine cosplay way back in the day when Mr. DeCons.

1606
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,960
I made a glove with something like that, but yeah, it was cool.

1607
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,960
I'm going to take a picture of it right now and I'm going to send it to you.

1608
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,960
Sick.

1609
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:10,960
I am excited. There better get a video as legendary as You've Got Chainmail associated with this incredible creative vision

1610
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,960
because I have long remembered back. I've watched it several times, You've Got Chainmail.

1611
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,960
It's one of the premier give and take content ever produced.

1612
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:26,960
I can't wait to have a full suit of armor made out of everyday items and you just cosplay like the everyday Dark Soul guy.

1613
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,960
You just go around and just slay random items throughout the world.

1614
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:39,960
When I worked at Astro Camp, we would have staff events, just like fun shit that we did with each other on weekends and stuff.

1615
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,960
People would sign up to schedule an event that people would go to.

1616
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,960
One weekend, it was like a water balloon fight, but it was like water balloon slash larping.

1617
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,960
There were rules. You had to like...

1618
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,960
Oh, I'm seeing the gauntlet. That's really funny. That's really cool looking.

1619
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,960
It looks like a Kingsguard, like a Kingsguard white plate.

1620
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,960
I'm going to be a white knight. I was thinking of potentially painting all the plates, but then I wouldn't know.

1621
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,960
White body.

1622
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,960
And now you can eat sloppy hamburgers and just drip it all over yourself.

1623
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,960
It doesn't matter because you shielded.

1624
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,960
Yeah, it's a project that will be like many months in the making if I ever get round to buying enough of the materials.

1625
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,960
But really cool, I think. I really like this.

1626
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,960
Excellent.

1627
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,960
But in this water balloon thing, you had to pick a class. You could be a major warrior.

1628
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:44,960
If you were a mage, you had more water balloons to throw, but if you were a warrior, you could take more hits with a water balloon before you were dead.

1629
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,960
And you were allowed to make a shield that could block a hit.

1630
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,960
It had to be a certain size and stuff, and you could only have one.

1631
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:01,960
And basically it was like, if you got wet from the water balloon, it counted as a hit, but if you blocked the water and you didn't get wet from it, then you were safe.

1632
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:09,960
And it was like an all day run around and try and form teams and try and ambush people. It was very fun.

1633
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:15,960
The girls are going to have a major disadvantage against me seeing my manly performance because they were all going to get wet.

1634
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,960
No, I'm saying girls.

1635
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,960
I am a heterosexual. Please believe me.

1636
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,960
Yeah, the operation was a success.

1637
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,960
Alright, well that's dope as hell.

1638
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Let's go fucking listen to some voicemails, I guess.

1639
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,960
Okay, here we go.

1640
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,960
Oh, of course, everyone, SpeakPipe.

1641
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,960
What's the URL again? I always fucking forget.

1642
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,960
I believe it's pzpvoicemail.

1643
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,960
Yeah, speakpipe.com slash pzpvoicemails, I think. Link in the description either way.

1644
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,960
Let me see, first one here is from Rizzy the Weeb.

1645
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,960
Rizzy the Weeb and Commence.

1646
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:07,960
Hi, so this is just a bit of advice to all the young PCP fans out there wanting to make their own YouTube channels.

1647
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,960
Don't.

1648
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:22,960
I started watching the PCP when I was 12 and before it I was a happy, cute, young girl with dreams.

1649
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,960
And then I started making YouTube videos and now I'm gay.

1650
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
What did you say?

1651
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,960
Just like digital and don't even get me started on my friends.

1652
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,960
They make this shitty YouTube lore that's fired by Jesse because even though they did watch it,

1653
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,960
no one listened to the message of the horsey Ustaga one year later because they're all stupid

1654
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,960
and it ruined their lives and I've disowned them all.

1655
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,960
So please don't be like us and have a nice day for once.

1656
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
Dude epic.

1657
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,960
Cutting right to the heart of the matter.

1658
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,960
Yeah, it used to be 12, now it's a strong 13.

1659
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,960
I had no idea the PCP...

1660
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,960
I had my whole life ahead of me back then.

1661
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,960
I had no idea the PCP fanbase was so young.

1662
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,960
Well, they're not all, but some of them are.

1663
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,960
No, all of them are, they're all little baby moms.

1664
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,960
That's fair, it's fair.

1665
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:29,960
And that's why we had to start RFCK to round up all the child soldiers and get them and put guns in their hands.

1666
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
The way God enchanted.

1667
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,960
Or nunchucks, or brass uncles, or whatever.

1668
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,960
Would you believe Paradox Crocs is only 11?

1669
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,960
Incredible.

1670
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,960
Shocking.

1671
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,960
Well, there it is, the voice of the people.

1672
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,960
Don't do YouTube, it's a mistake.

1673
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,960
Alright, next one, voicemail from the talent man.

1674
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960
The talent man.

1675
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,960
Let's see how he's talented.

1676
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,960
Hey guys, I'm Hippocrite.

1677
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,960
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know.

1678
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,960
Hey guys, I'm best guy, Hippocrite.

1679
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,960
I love copy the listen.

1680
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Do it, wish me happy.

1681
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,960
Hey guys, I'm the boo.

1682
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,960
Creep, creep, creep, creep.

1683
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,960
And now I'm just, I'm funny.

1684
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,960
Wow.

1685
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,960
You know, I was doubtful.

1686
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,960
That is so, that is so something he'd say.

1687
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,960
You know, you know when you're right, you're, you know, you're right.

1688
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,960
Because I do say you know a lot.

1689
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
You know, yeah.

1690
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,960
But you know, it's all fine, and it's all good, and it's all part of my mystique.

1691
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,960
He really is the talent man ever.

1692
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,960
Alright, let's just move on.

1693
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,960
Next one, normal quick draw, saloon advertisement is the name of this one.

1694
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,960
So let's, let's see what's on deck.

1695
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,960
Oh.

1696
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,960
18 naked cowboys in the showers, a quick draw saloon.

1697
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,960
Big hearts, robbing styluses, waiting to be sucked.

1698
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,960
18 naked cowboys, waiting to be colored in.

1699
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:27,960
Cowboys in the showers, a quick saloon on their knees, waiting to draw cowboys cracks.

1700
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,960
Quick draw saloon.

1701
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,960
Oh God.

1702
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,960
That's it.

1703
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:40,960
Put it in the show notes, put it in the show notes, a link to join the quick draw saloon discord.

1704
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,960
Okay, we got, please do so.

1705
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,960
Good, good.

1706
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,960
This is the advertisement they needed.

1707
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,960
This will send them flooding, quick draw saloon.

1708
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,960
Okay, next one.

1709
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,960
This is from YouTube recommendations God, that just what we need, okay.

1710
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,960
I am the YouTube recommendations God.

1711
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:13,960
I subscribe to no one, and exclusively use YouTube recommendations, which brings me what I watch without failure.

1712
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,960
Which is the procrastinator's podcast.

1713
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,960
Yeah.

1714
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:27,960
Every Friday, as soon as it releases, and I enter YouTube, it brings it to me because YouTube is my bitch.

1715
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,960
And I have made it my bitch.

1716
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:41,960
And I don't subscribe to you, or pay your stupid God Sam patriarchs.

1717
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,960
You're just missing out.

1718
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,960
Okay, there you go.

1719
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,960
He just disappeared into the ether.

1720
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,960
A message of hope.

1721
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,960
Maybe YouTube isn't so broken after all, there's hope from God himself.

1722
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,960
I would like to know if anybody was just like, oh, I'm just on YouTube recommended.

1723
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,960
Oh, what's this, the procrastinators podcast, PCP, I like drugs.

1724
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,960
Like, did anybody find us through that?

1725
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,960
God, I hope so.

1726
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,960
We've got a large drug using demographic, I have no doubt.

1727
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,960
The only drugs our viewers take is there a hormone replacement therapy.

1728
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,960
That's what I mean.

1729
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,960
When you're right, you're right, Ben.

1730
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,960
Alright, next one.

1731
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,960
This is from I'm Just Being Chad.

1732
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,960
So, get to it.

1733
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,960
Alright, I'm Just Being Cool Purple Hoodie from the Teespring officially.

1734
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,960
And here's what I'm doing.

1735
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,960
I got that on, and imagine I got a fanny pack.

1736
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
Please do.

1737
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,960
This sounds like a minimized 50% munchie.

1738
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,960
The music songs are the good ones, and I'm jamming out in the hallways.

1739
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,960
Hardcore, fucking real shit.

1740
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,960
And it reminds me I'm the cool kid now, except still no GF,

1741
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,960
but I don't even fucking care, because it's so fun to just be cool.

1742
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,960
And it's the best thing ever.

1743
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,960
Thanks for liberating me.

1744
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,960
Oh, Just Being Cool!

1745
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,960
There he goes.

1746
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,960
Oh, there he goes. Mr. Weezerman.

1747
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,960
Okay, good. Good.

1748
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,960
I think we've heard enough.

1749
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:24,960
I like to imagine that this boy has just got a grand piano.

1750
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,960
It sounds like a normal piano, but it could be a big grand piano that was super polished.

1751
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,960
And this is the richest boy in America he's wearing in.

1752
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:41,960
He's wearing his I'm Just Being Cool hoodie in the fucking Carnegie Hall opera house or whatever.

1753
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:47,960
No, this is a big anime fan, a fan of anime podcasts, The Procrastiners Podcast,

1754
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:53,960
of Baron Trump calling in from Trump Tower to give us the stuff we need.

1755
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,960
That's why he's a chat.

1756
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:00,960
Thinking about him just tuning out the world to his tunes, wearing his purple eye,

1757
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,960
it kind of sounds like the worst guy ever, a little bit.

1758
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,960
It kind of sounds like there's maybe some resemblance.

1759
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:14,960
No, the worst guy ever has no abilities, such as piano playing, speech without impediment.

1760
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,960
The idea of being cool, he would never call himself Chad.

1761
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,960
That is a patriarchal term that I'm certain he would never use to describe himself.

1762
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,960
So we can roll that one out for sure.

1763
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:31,960
But good news, new voicemail, it's time to shit on the Pizza Party podcast.

1764
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,960
Yes, finally!

1765
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,960
Everyone's favorite segment.

1766
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,960
Let's play it. We need to make this a regular segment.

1767
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,960
I want to hear that every episode, and we all bring a list of grievances.

1768
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,960
No, let's seriously do this.

1769
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,960
I know nothing about them.

1770
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,960
Let's start right now.

1771
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,960
I will bring a list of grievances starting this week against the Pizza Party podcast.

1772
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,960
Okay, grievance number one, pizza's not keto.

1773
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:18,960
Number two, movies don't like them.

1774
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Number three, parties.

1775
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,960
I have no affiliation with any political parties.

1776
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,960
What is this political hackery, guys?

1777
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,960
Cut it out.

1778
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,960
Number four, never listen to the podcast.

1779
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,960
Where is it, guys? The end.

1780
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,960
I'm convinced, man.

1781
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,960
We'll be waiting for your diss track next week.

1782
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,960
Where's the Pizza Party podcast?

1783
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,960
That's all I'm saying.

1784
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,960
I'm just waiting. Where's the podcast, guys?

1785
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Where the hell is it?

1786
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,960
Double PCP member.

1787
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,960
Okay, let's go.

1788
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,960
Next one, Steven Universe Gay.

1789
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,960
Commence.

1790
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Steven Universe, more like gay.

1791
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:06,960
Steven Universe is gay.

1792
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,960
What does everybody have a piano?

1793
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,960
What does everybody have a piano this time?

1794
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:11,960
Is this the same guy?

1795
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,960
No, that's a different guy, I think.

1796
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,960
Okay, there he goes.

1797
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Maybe it is the same guy.

1798
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,960
There's no way for me to tell.

1799
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,960
Good.

1800
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,960
There he goes.

1801
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,960
He's really going for it.

1802
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,960
He's going for it.

1803
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,960
I played this as an apology

1804
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,960
to everyone who's bored of Steven Universe topics.

1805
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,960
So am I.

1806
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,960
No more of that.

1807
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,960
And I'm stronger than you.

1808
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,960
I didn't even give him a fair shake.

1809
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,960
Good job playing the piano, sir.

1810
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,960
It's just that it happened to come right after another one

1811
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,960
who also did, so you've been upstaged.

1812
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,960
It was good. That was a really good piano.

1813
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,960
It was good, yeah.

1814
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,960
It's true.

1815
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,960
I like the warbliness of it.

1816
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,960
Next one is Thu for you.

1817
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,960
Could this be the return of our hero, Jeff?

1818
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,960
Let's find out.

1819
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,960
This voicemail is brought to you by

1820
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,960
bonus episode number 22, Dreams Cast,

1821
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,960
in which Nate mentioned an octopus story,

1822
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,960
which he failed to recount,

1823
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,960
because apparently he said it many times.

1824
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,960
I want to hear Nate's octopus story.

1825
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,960
Tell me about the octopuses.

1826
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,960
This has been from the Dreams Cast,

1827
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:33,960
making you shit the bed every single time.

1828
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,960
First of all, I wish I could have shit the bed

1829
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,960
the other night, but beyond that,

1830
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,960
if you want to hear the full context here, people,

1831
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,960
the low, low price of $5 on patreon.com

1832
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
slash the procrastinators per episode,

1833
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,960
get in there, and you're going to want to hear that.

1834
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,960
But in brief, I had a dream once that was me

1835
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,960
becoming a viral internet sensation

1836
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,960
because I went up to a takoyaki stand

1837
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,960
and demanded, quote, unquote, octopus balls,

1838
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,960
which is, I suppose, one to describe takoyaki

1839
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,960
as they are little balls of dough with octopus inside them.

1840
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,960
And someone captured this on film,

1841
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,960
and this became a viral sensation,

1842
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,960
Nate and his octopus balls, and that was the dream.

1843
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,960
Wasn't it in the clip, weren't you yelling,

1844
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,960
like, I want my goddamn octopus balls?

1845
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,960
That sounds right. That sounds right.

1846
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,960
I think that's what you said when you told me about it.

1847
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:25,960
Because I know I've talked about it before.

1848
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,960
So yeah, and it was that.

1849
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,960
And everyone thought that was so fucking funny,

1850
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,960
like so random, dude.

1851
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,960
Like, who would even say that?

1852
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,960
Oh, my God.

1853
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,960
And this dream did become a DBZ battle

1854
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,960
shortly afterward.

1855
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,960
That was pretty cool as I flew through the skies.

1856
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,960
With who?

1857
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,960
Well, I don't know who I was fighting,

1858
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,960
but I was presumably using my newfound internet fame

1859
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,960
to fuel my flight and my strikes.

1860
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,960
That's all I remember.

1861
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,960
Okay.

1862
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,960
I think that was it.

1863
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,960
Okay, anyway, so there's the story.

1864
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,960
Moving on.

1865
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,960
Next one is from Art Director 69.

1866
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,960
Oh, I typed the right command here.

1867
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,960
And go.

1868
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,960
Hey, what's up, Art Director 69 here with a question

1869
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,960
about self-expression.

1870
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,960
How do you feel about artists being vulnerable

1871
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,960
and emotional in their work?

1872
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,960
Don't do it.

1873
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,960
It's prevalence in music,

1874
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,960
but I'm talking more specifically about games,

1875
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,960
comics, and film.

1876
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,960
Do you think you will ever bleed onto a page?

1877
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,960
I fucking bleed onto the page every day of my life.

1878
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:28,960
Let's wait.

1879
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,960
My fucking wrists.

1880
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Oh, yeah, that too.

1881
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,960
What do you think?

1882
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,960
I guess I'm trying to think about,

1883
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,960
like, being emotionally vulnerable in the art.

1884
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,960
Like, you write a book and it's like a thing

1885
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,960
that's very close to your heart and then somebody says,

1886
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,960
this book sucks and you get really hurt

1887
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,960
because that's you, basically.

1888
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,960
Yeah, that's one way.

1889
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,960
Like, is that sort of like a vulnerability

1890
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,960
that he's talking about?

1891
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,960
Okay, with, yeah, go on, go on.

1892
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,960
It depends on how much you want to express that.

1893
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,960
Yeah.

1894
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,960
But like, in any art, if you express yourself,

1895
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,960
and people just hate it, then, I don't know.

1896
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,960
You're gonna feel sad if you care about something

1897
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,960
that you make and people really don't like it.

1898
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,960
Yeah, that's definitely true.

1899
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,960
But you wanted to make it in the first place.

1900
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,960
It's just a matter of degrees, right?

1901
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,960
Like, everybody's expecting, you know,

1902
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,960
putting themselves into their art

1903
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,960
because that's just the nature of what it is.

1904
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
It's just depending on how direct

1905
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,960
or how deep you want to go into it.

1906
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,960
When I think about being emotionally vulnerable

1907
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,960
through your art, I think of something like,

1908
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,960
you know, like you basically put yourself

1909
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,960
into the story, right?

1910
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,960
You have like a character, have like an emotional conflict

1911
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,960
that is basically like it's yours, right?

1912
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,960
Like you write a story about how your wife left you

1913
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,960
because you really like suck and dick.

1914
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,960
And then you put that in the story

1915
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,960
and you make that the main character's conflict

1916
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:54,960
and you make it relatable.

1917
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,960
There are like degrees of separation,

1918
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,960
because like in music, he said as the prime example,

1919
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,960
a lot of people will sing in the first person

1920
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,960
and be like, blah, blah, blah, she left me,

1921
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,960
I was really sad, et cetera, et cetera.

1922
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,960
So, and like if you write a story,

1923
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,960
there's, you can always hide behind a veil.

1924
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,960
I mean, even with music, a lot of people say like that,

1925
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,960
you know, they amp up the emotions being portrayed

1926
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,960
in the songs and the lyrics and whatnot.

1927
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,960
I mean, obviously they are.

1928
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,960
Remember that book, How Not to Write a Novel?

1929
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,960
Of course, yes.

1930
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,960
Okay, I remember there's one example

1931
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,960
of like badly written like putting like obviously

1932
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,960
the main character is the author.

1933
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,960
And it's like, it's like the passage is like,

1934
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,960
he stared into his beer, you know, you know, morose.

1935
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,960
You know, he had tried to deny it for so long.

1936
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,960
He had thought he could fix the problem.

1937
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,960
He had tried everything, but the time had come.

1938
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:46,960
He had to face the harsh reality of the situation.

1939
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,960
I was impotent.

1940
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:52,960
That's, okay, that's pretty good.

1941
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,960
I guess that would give it away.

1942
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,960
That would.

1943
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,960
Yeah.

1944
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,960
But that's what I, that's what I think of when I think of like,

1945
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,960
you know, being, making yourself emotionally vulnerable

1946
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,960
through your art.

1947
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,960
I mean, story about some hard shit that you had to deal with.

1948
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,960
Yeah.

1949
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,960
And put it on display, even if it is in a fictionalized context.

1950
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,960
That's true.

1951
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,960
I think it just depends on.

1952
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,960
You write a story where people read it and they're like,

1953
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,960
I can tell that like the author went through this.

1954
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,960
The author knows how this feels.

1955
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,960
I think it depends a lot on like how much you feel the need

1956
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,960
to tell the story at all.

1957
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,960
Like if it's, if it's hurting to keep it bottled up inside,

1958
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,960
but you don't want to just talk about it in a normal conversation,

1959
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,960
then art is the way to go.

1960
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,960
But like if it's, if it's just sort of like,

1961
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,960
you could write a book about it and it's embarrassing if people

1962
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,960
thought it was you and you'd be, you know,

1963
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,960
you'd feel vulnerable about it,

1964
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,960
but you don't, you don't, you could just never talk about it

1965
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,960
and it would be fine.

1966
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,960
Well, you know, that's kind of interesting.

1967
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,960
Like, you know, serious question, slightly rhetorical,

1968
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,960
but it's like, what, what is the point of like putting your emotions

1969
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:56,960
into a story?

1970
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,960
Like to put your emotion, your emotional vulnerability in it.

1971
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,960
And like, like, why not like, I don't like go see a counselor

1972
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,960
and like work it out or something.

1973
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,960
I suppose it's to exploit it for literal monetary gain, right?

1974
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,960
I don't think it's necessarily to exploit.

1975
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,960
Cause you could have like, you could have like had an experience

1976
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,960
and then gotten over it and then you still remember the experience.

1977
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,960
So you could use that to inform a character.

1978
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,960
I think it's like writing what you know, you know,

1979
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,960
if it's something that you have experience with,

1980
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,960
it's like you can, you're going to be able to give whatever story

1981
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,960
you're crafting a degree of authenticity.

1982
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,960
You know, you're not making something up.

1983
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,960
And it's true.

1984
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,960
And it's, yeah, it's not just authenticity.

1985
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,960
It's just like also easier to work on something

1986
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,960
when you know what you're doing.

1987
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Like if you, if you say, oh, what's hot right now,

1988
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,960
characters who have no legs.

1989
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,960
All right.

1990
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,960
I don't know what it's like, but I guess I'll try

1991
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,960
and write a story about the guy doesn't have legs.

1992
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,960
Yeah.

1993
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,960
It's going to be more difficult for you to do that

1994
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,960
unless you're a complete hack.

1995
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,960
Well, that's certainly true.

1996
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,960
And you hacked your legs off.

1997
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,960
That'd be commitment.

1998
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,960
This makes me think of, I don't know,

1999
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,960
there's some mediums that are different.

2000
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,960
Like when you're writing a story about another character,

2001
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,960
you can definitely make it about the issues that you care about.

2002
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
And probably without, without exception,

2003
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,960
almost every, I suppose I'll say,

2004
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,960
every like sincere story that's written

2005
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,960
will probably be informed by some experience.

2006
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,960
Like at least to a degree.

2007
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,960
Like the author has had.

2008
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,960
I literally don't know how you couldn't do that.

2009
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,960
You have to on some level understand.

2010
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,960
It's mandatory for an art by one person.

2011
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,960
When you're working in a team,

2012
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,960
people's ideas and values get squished together

2013
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,960
and compromised and, you know,

2014
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,960
the bigger the committee, the weirder it is,

2015
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,960
the less fair to say.

2016
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,960
Less of a personal project it becomes.

2017
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,960
That's true.

2018
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,960
And you could all, I suppose you could literally like,

2019
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,960
let's say that you just, yeah, you want to write about depression.

2020
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,960
You literally like Google someone's book about depression,

2021
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,960
read it, and then attempt to like, you know,

2022
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,960
just do what they said or something.

2023
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,960
But I'm not.

2024
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,960
I mean, to a lesser degree, I think people do that all the time.

2025
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,960
They're trying to, you know, be accurate to what they're trying to represent.

2026
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,960
And they want to have a certain aspect in the art,

2027
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,960
but they don't have personal experience.

2028
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,960
They look it up to try and model it.

2029
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,960
In Vapors 3, Magda goes to the hospital.

2030
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,960
And I remember when I, this was like, planning out the story,

2031
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,960
I talked to-

2032
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,960
Does she also not be able to shit?

2033
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,960
Stop ripping off my stories, man. God damn it.

2034
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,960
I, um, like, I wanted to write this, but I was like,

2035
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,960
I don't really know, like, how the procedure would,

2036
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,960
like, I don't know, like, what the hospital protocol would be for this.

2037
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,960
So I talked to, fuck, what's your friend's name

2038
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,960
for your high school friend? It doesn't matter.

2039
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,960
But you know, yeah, you had a friend in high school,

2040
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,960
a girl who, I, she was like a nurse or something.

2041
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,960
And I, and I called her.

2042
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,960
Oh yeah, I know her.

2043
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,960
Hey, like, you, you work at a hospital,

2044
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,960
tell me how you think it would go if XYZ happened.

2045
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,960
What would be done with this person?

2046
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:53,960
Yeah, okay.

2047
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:54,960
And, uh, so I-

2048
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,960
She said, who the hell are you?

2049
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,960
Yeah.

2050
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,960
Was that, was that recent, or was that a while ago?

2051
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,960
No, that was, like, before I even started making it.

2052
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,960
Okay, okay.

2053
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,960
This was just like to get, like, how would this go?

2054
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,960
And then I was like, okay, so here's, here's, okay.

2055
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,960
So I, I have at least one, like, professional's opinion

2056
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,960
that this is more or less what would happen.

2057
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,960
And I was like, okay, well, you know,

2058
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,960
maybe it wouldn't always happen, but I'm satisfied.

2059
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,960
I'm satisfied that my story is not, like, stupid and ridiculous

2060
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,960
and someone would read it and be like,

2061
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,960
this would never happen.

2062
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
This doesn't make any sense.

2063
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,960
Hospitals would, you know, wouldn't do this.

2064
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Um, yeah.

2065
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,960
Well, that's cool.

2066
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,960
But I mean, to get back to his point of, like,

2067
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,960
specifically emotional vulnerability or whatever,

2068
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,960
I mean, the first thing that that made me think of

2069
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,960
was, obviously, like, music comes to mind.

2070
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,960
But, like, for something that I've done,

2071
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,960
like, in Gurren Lagann, part two,

2072
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,960
there's that moment at the end where I specifically

2073
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,960
draw the focus to, like, me

2074
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,960
and how, like, I personally, like,

2075
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:48,960
I'm like, blah, blah, blah.

2076
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,960
This story could really make a difference.

2077
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:52,960
Like, let's say, like, a sad, lonely guy,

2078
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,960
like, making videos in his mom's basement or whatever,

2079
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,960
or, you know, like, in his, whatever,

2080
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
in, like, a shitty apartment that, you know,

2081
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,960
and he knows by only, like, working hard

2082
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,960
to improve his life and stopping addicted to, like,

2083
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,960
sex, video games, drugs, or, like, whatever,

2084
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,960
really, like, improve.

2085
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,960
And there's, like, a picture of me on screen.

2086
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,960
I am saying this about myself.

2087
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,960
And so, like, so, like, this is what it meant to me.

2088
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,960
And I'm saying, like, yeah, like, I fuck up.

2089
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,960
That's not a particularly vulnerable moment,

2090
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,960
or anything.

2091
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,960
But, like, I really don't like being vulnerable

2092
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,960
pretty much at all.

2093
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,960
Though, obviously, it's...

2094
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,960
But you know what I was gonna say, though?

2095
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,960
But I definitely recognize,

2096
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,960
and I kind of feel like,

2097
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,960
like, using quote-unquote vulnerability,

2098
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,960
or at least signaling vulnerability with, like,

2099
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
sappy music or, like, talking softly,

2100
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,960
sure is a good way to, like, make people give a shit.

2101
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,960
Or, you know?

2102
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,960
There's a...

2103
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,960
Yeah, it's just something you see on YouTube,

2104
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,960
like, someone will just do it.

2105
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,960
I don't know, there was one...

2106
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,960
I remember Logan Paul crying when he could see color

2107
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,960
for the first time.

2108
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:58,960
I don't think that's actually being vulnerable.

2109
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,960
If you're hamming it up on purpose,

2110
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,960
that's, like, a marketing test.

2111
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,960
That's my point.

2112
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,960
Yeah, yeah.

2113
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,960
And, you know, it's hard, because, like,

2114
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,960
you see YouTubers do it all the time,

2115
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,960
and you don't want to be like,

2116
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,960
oh, this person's just faking that.

2117
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,960
This person, you know, they're just doing it for the view.

2118
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,960
Like, you know, I think in any...

2119
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,960
Okay, this is a piece of art that someone is making

2120
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,960
to put out for public consumption.

2121
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,960
So, in any of these scenarios,

2122
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,960
there is some amount of, like, performance

2123
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,960
and, like, selection.

2124
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,960
Like, some thought goes into how this will be presented.

2125
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,960
Even if it's just that they chose to release it

2126
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,960
versus not release it, they chose that.

2127
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,960
Yeah, even if it were totally candid,

2128
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,960
this is being, like, put out on the internet.

2129
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,960
But, like, yeah.

2130
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,960
But you can't...

2131
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,960
You can't say, oh, this is all fake,

2132
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,960
because, like, obviously, if there's a motion there,

2133
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,960
it must come from at least slightly a real place.

2134
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,960
Like, they must at least know some...

2135
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:48,960
Like, I don't know.

2136
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,960
I mean, I guess some people could just be lying,

2137
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,960
but I'm sure that's...

2138
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
They're not.

2139
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,960
I'm sure most people are...

2140
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,960
I don't know.

2141
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,960
Someone will make...

2142
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,960
They'll have one episode where they talk about suicide

2143
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,960
and then they'll be like, actually, guys,

2144
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,960
you know, I didn't want to talk about this,

2145
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,960
but, you know, I actually tried to commit suicide once

2146
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,960
and I was like, oh, my God, me too.

2147
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,960
Yeah, on this subject, I'm definitely guilty of hyperbole

2148
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,960
at various points in my output of content and whatnot.

2149
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:14,960
I...

2150
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,960
My highest virtue is honesty,

2151
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,960
and so I always try to avoid it,

2152
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,960
but I'm certain that I've...

2153
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,960
Might as well you avoid honesty.

2154
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,960
Well, did I say that wrong?

2155
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,960
Well, no, it sounded like you said

2156
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,960
my highest virtue is honesty, comma,

2157
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,960
so I always try to avoid it.

2158
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:29,960
Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

2159
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,960
Well, so that's important.

2160
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,960
That's one virtue I'm trying to purge myself.

2161
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:36,960
So I don't know.

2162
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,960
Like, I'm certain that I will continue to do things

2163
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,960
that are at least somewhat emotionally,

2164
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,960
whatever, vulnerability inducing or whatever,

2165
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,960
but I don't know.

2166
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,960
It's not something that I really like to do that much.

2167
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,960
I don't know.

2168
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,960
That's all I got.

2169
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:54,960
That's all I got.

2170
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:56,960
Okay, we got one more.

2171
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,960
We got one more,

2172
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,960
and this voicemail is from a friend of the show,

2173
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,960
Niggas Flexin and Still Hatin.

2174
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,960
So let's see what he's got for us.

2175
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,960
Go.

2176
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,960
Hey, take a big hit.

2177
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,960
Talk a little shit.

2178
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,960
You know what I mean?

2179
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:13,960
Your niggas is coolin', doin' what you doin',

2180
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:14,960
fuckin' with the PCP.

2181
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,960
Y'all should come out to the hood sometime.

2182
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,960
Your niggas is good and boptin'.

2183
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,960
Peace.

2184
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,960
Wait, what was that last one?

2185
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,960
He said peace.

2186
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,960
Your niggas is good and bumpin'.

2187
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,960
Oh, okay.

2188
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,960
Oh, I like bumpin'.

2189
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,960
Yeah, me too.

2190
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,960
Yeah.

2191
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:30,960
I appreciate that.

2192
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,960
Well, Ben, you headin' out to the hood?

2193
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,960
Yeah, headin' out to the hood to get some milk.

2194
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,960
I'm gonna bump down the road in my bunker car.

2195
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,960
Chocolate, strawberry, whole milk, skim milk.

2196
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,960
The choices are endless.

2197
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,960
Oh, my God.

2198
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Wow, was that president of Hood Corporation,

2199
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,960
a niggas flexin' and still hatin' the man himself?

2200
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,960
Thank you.

2201
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,960
What a character.

2202
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:02,960
Well, I can't.

2203
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,960
You can't.

2204
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:04,960
You can't.

2205
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,960
No, I'm gonna get some heavy cream,

2206
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,960
because it's key.

2207
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,960
Yeah, of course.

2208
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,960
You guys got heavy cream?

2209
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,960
He'll hook you up.

2210
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,960
Can we get a sponsorship by the Hood Corporation, perhaps,

2211
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,960
or a heavy cream on the PCP?

2212
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:15,960
Please.

2213
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:16,960
I'll drink it live.

2214
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,960
Okay, let's go.

2215
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,960
I think we're done here.

2216
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,960
That was the last one.

2217
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,960
We're wrappin' it up.

2218
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,960
Okay, so patreon.com, people, slash the procrastinators,

2219
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,960
give us $5 for the bonus episodes.

2220
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,960
Dreamcast, you heard a little discussion of it.

2221
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,960
Get in on the action, people.

2222
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,960
You don't want to be left out in the cold.

2223
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:36,960
You want to be in on the party.

2224
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,960
So give us your money, please.

2225
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,960
Twitter, at TPCrastinators.

2226
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,960
You know, we're doin' our thang on there.

2227
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,960
So go follow for updates and whatnot.

2228
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,960
Speakpipe, of course.

2229
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,960
Speakpipe.

2230
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,960
Of course.

2231
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:49,960
Get in there.

2232
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:50,960
Link in the description.

2233
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:51,960
Leave us your voicemails.

2234
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,960
There were a lot of voicemails this week.

2235
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,960
A lot of them were, like, kind of bordering on good,

2236
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,960
but I had to cut many of them anyway.

2237
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,960
So keep up in your quality, people.

2238
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,960
Keep workin' on it.

2239
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,960
Oh, and the only other thing is, of course,

2240
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,960
let me remind everybody, again,

2241
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,960
the hashtag PCP Editor contest

2242
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,960
is goin' strong for one more week.

2243
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,960
You've got one week from when you're here in this

2244
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,960
to enter if you so desire.

2245
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,960
And one week should be plenty of time to get it done.

2246
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,960
So there'll be a link in the show notes,

2247
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,960
and there's a whole other video,

2248
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,960
the one probably that came out before this,

2249
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,960
a hashtag PCP Editor contest.

2250
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
Go watch it.

2251
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:24,960
Read the document.

2252
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,960
It's important.

2253
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,960
Make sure you do all the steps.

2254
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,960
And there you go.

2255
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:28,960
Best of luck.

2256
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,960
I mean, the best individual win.

2257
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,960
So that's it.

2258
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:32,960
Excellent.

2259
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:33,960
Excellent.

2260
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:34,960
Thanks for being here.

2261
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,960
Another one in the bag, boys.

2262
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,960
That's correct.

2263
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,960
Another paycheck cashed.

2264
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,960
We did it.

2265
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,960
Thanks for being here,

2266
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,960
and we'll see you next week, everybody.

2267
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:42,960
Bye.

2268
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,960
Bye.

2269
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,960
Yeah.

2270
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,960
Yeah.

2271
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,960
Yeah.

2272
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:47,960
Oh.

2273
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,960
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2274
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,960
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2275
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,960
But I'm not working.

2276
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,960
I'm doing nothing.

2277
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,960
Why did I come jerking?

2278
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,960
Myself, I'm sucking.

2279
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,960
I am an asshole.

2280
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,960
I am a stupid.

2281
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,960
I've got a deadline.

2282
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,960
Don't want to do it.
