1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Uh, do you think you would ever consider coming back to Game Grumps in the future?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,160
Unfortunately, I don't think...

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
No, I won't be returning to the Game Grumps.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,880
Sorry.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,120
That's a fine word.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,040
a podcast about a bunch of people on the internet who do shit there talking about garbage.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm the best guy ever and today we're joined by Tom Oliver.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
You'll all pay for this!

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,080
I've got 4,700 followers on Twitter and each and every one of them has a sniper rifle

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,440
trained on your location.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,360
This isn't about ethics and podcast journalism, this is about harassment of me.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,920
I've got some drama for you, a drama's into your fucking house and breaks all your legs,

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,960
every single one of them.

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,120
These are all death threats.

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm sending this all to the cyber police.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
The next draw cast is going to be more like a PCP drama cast.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
Leave Brittany alone.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,480
Hello, thank you everyone for joining us on this very special episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,920
all about drama.

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
All about drama.

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
It's many forms.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
The thing we like the most in the entire world, as is evident.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
That's correct.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,960
That's correct.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
And before we get into it, let's read that old Urban Dictionary definition here.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,960
Drama, definition number two, making a big deal out of something unnecessarily.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
That bitch, I'm going to kick her ass.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,720
Dag, Jenny, all she did was look at you.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Why you got to be so drama?

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Wow.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,920
There you go.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,040
Thanks Urban Dictionary.

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,000
You're beautiful.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,720
You're fantastic.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,360
You said it all.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,960
It's even more and more evident that the Urban Dictionary is actually just the ebonics

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,120
dictionary for when you want to go into the...

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,680
That is what it means by...

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Learn about the Urban Demographic and you're going to go in, quote, the hood.

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
We're going to start some drama already right off the bat because we only introduced me

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
and Nate and no one else got introduced.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
We just went right into the fucking podcast.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
You're trying to throw me under the bus, Nate.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
You're trying to throw your own brother under the bus.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,120
I get it.

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
It's a pup to play.

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,360
It's the upper class and the lower class divided by being introduced and that.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,600
I finally joined the bourgeois where I belong.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,240
God, it feels great.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm from fucking proletariat revolt, in my opinion.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
Just shit talking podcast hosts for half an hour.

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
Oh, God, what have I done?

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,160
It's time to seize the means of production.

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,840
We're locking you all out of the Patreon.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,320
We're taking...

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Come on, no!

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
Here's a cheapo triple introduction.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
We've got Digi Bro, Munchy Warsh Tiny Hats, and Ben St. Say Words.

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
It's me, Munchy Warsh Tiny Hats.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
I've never been in drama before.

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,880
I've never been in pajamas before.

63
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
It's me, Digi Bro.

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
I've been in all the drama before.

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
He's very popular.

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
He's very well versed.

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm Ben St. and everyone likes me.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,880
All right, team.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,240
So drama, it's not even real.

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,960
It's not even something that happens in the real world.

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,120
It's some fantasy that happens online that isn't true and is fake.

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
So what do you have to say to that shit right there?

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
Internet drama sucks, but real life drama is great because...

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, like the fucking Civil War?

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, exactly.

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
That's exactly what I unironically mean.

77
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
Whenever there's internet drama, it's like,

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
Oh, PewDiePie said nigger, like,

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,720
Oh God, fucking cry me a river.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
But whatever, one of my friends does something.

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
Munchy says that to me every second of what you did.

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Get over it at this point.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
And I beg for more.

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,160
When I sleep, I'm like...

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,240
But whenever there's something that happens in real life,

86
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm like, yes, I can finally talk shit about this person.

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
No one will get mad at me when I do.

88
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
I feel like that's a big excuse.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,280
That is such a great point, Munchy.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
That is what...

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,360
In some ways, I love drama for exactly that reason, which is that

92
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,640
there are some people that basically...

93
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,160
I hate that they're in my life,

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
but there's no excuse to get rid of them yet.

95
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
You're constantly harboring this like,

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
Oh, fucking that guy.

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
Like, you always come kind of like...

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
You always pull your friends aside.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Like, have you noticed that that dude's fucking like a piece of shit?

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
And they're like, I don't know what kind of notice.

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
And you're like, I feel like I've really...

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
Like, didn't you notice he did that?

103
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,560
And they're like, well, I guess.

104
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
And you're like, fuck, man.

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,200
And you're just waiting for the day that they fucking step over the line.

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,920
And then it's just like, all right, I knew it.

107
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,360
You know, it's like, I knew it.

108
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
I knew this was a problem.

109
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,320
Now let's get it all out.

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Let's get it all out there.

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
This is hyper-realistic.

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
This is too realistic.

113
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
This has too many graphics.

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
I love Monkey Jones.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
I love Monkey Jones.

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
God damn it!

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm just popping that bubble right now.

118
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
There it is, there it is.

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,760
That's not even close to what I was thinking.

120
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,480
That's not who I was thinking about at all.

121
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,320
You guys don't even know how much fucking drama I have.

122
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
I got drama with everybody.

123
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Offline, online, I always got drama.

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
We get drag into your drama all the goddamn time.

125
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,120
Yes.

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
Sometimes, sometimes.

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
Well, more lately than in The Bed is True.

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Shitstormed by association.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,120
It's fantastic.

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,200
But okay, we can talk about some of these stuff,

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
but really we're here to talk about the meta-concept of drama.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
And it's the place in the world.

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
That's the important part.

134
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Yeah, indeed.

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,840
Indeed.

136
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,160
And yeah, it's like, drama, when it doesn't affect me

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,000
or the people I know specifically, I don't really

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
concern myself with.

139
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,680
And whenever I see really epic and funny tweets

140
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
with Hollywood actors saying cool things in TV shows

141
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
with impact text over them, reacting to some pedophile

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
coming out as a pedophile, pretty good, doesn't really

143
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,280
matter to me.

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,480
I don't really care about that.

145
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,840
But when it's the real people in your real life,

146
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,320
and you get to finally just air out all of your greed,

147
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
you get to have the air of grievances,

148
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
then I truly enjoy it greatly.

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
Oh, boy.

150
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Let me tell you a story.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,480
I'm with you.

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,640
Let me tell you about the story about a guy.

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,040
I've codenamed him D on the internet, usually,

154
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
when I bring him up.

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
But I also say his real name Derek all the time,

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
so I don't know why I bought it.

157
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,280
All right, this dude was a member of my group of friends

158
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,760
for a very long time, like six years.

159
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,400
And he was a guy who he knew from Japanese class,

160
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,440
and he was just kind of all the intellectuals gathered.

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, exactly.

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Most of my friends, I met the Japanese class.

163
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
But he would come over to my house,

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
and he was always kind of a shitty house guest.

165
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
He complained about my music.

166
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,760
He'd be very demanding.

167
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,320
He would want you to almost acquiesce

168
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,280
to what he wanted while he was in my house.

169
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,920
But he also regarded my house as a paradise on earth,

170
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
because he hated being at home,

171
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,280
and we were so loose in free form that he loved hanging it out.

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
But he wasn't the best guy to have around, you know?

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
So he super wants to be everybody's friend,

174
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
but everyone's kind of tepid about having him around.

175
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
But he's into some good stuff.

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,040
He likes some good animes, some good music here and there.

177
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
He likes drinking.

178
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
So I hung out with him, you know, a pretty decent amount.

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
But as time went on, he would just do so much annoying shit.

180
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,320
And gradually, it got to a point

181
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,080
where everyone else in my group of friends

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
would just hang out and shit talk Derek.

183
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
Like, that was our main pastime.

184
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Because it had gotten so bad,

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
but he'd never done any one thing that was like,

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
let's never talk to him again.

187
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,320
Like, it's hard to cut somebody out of your life entirely, you know?

188
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,400
It's hard to just be like, you know,

189
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
you don't have enough redeeming quality.

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
And like, especially when they want to be your friend,

191
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,320
when like they want to be, like he totally wanted to be around.

192
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
And, but like people would constantly have fucking,

193
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
even my parents would shit talk him.

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Because he pissed them off so many times.

195
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,320
He would say like weird shit on Facebook, piss off my mom.

196
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,840
And we got to a point where my mom was like,

197
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
if he does one more thing, I'm kicking him out, right?

198
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,680
And we were all like waiting.

199
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Like everyone's like, oh man, I hope he fucks up one more time.

200
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,800
So my mom could kick him out.

201
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,160
But he wasn't doing anything.

202
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,720
And then finally, on Christmas day.

203
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
Oh my god, yeah.

204
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
He says something off color.

205
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,840
He fucking had the audacity to be Jewish on Christmas.

206
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,600
That was the last fucking straw.

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
He, my brother Victor had been talking

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,640
to a younger cousin of ours for a while.

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
He was kind of like mentoring her.

210
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,880
And Derek says, Derek says to Victor

211
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,040
that Victor's other good friend had said something

212
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
about Victor like wanting to fuck this cousin, essentially.

213
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
How old was this cousin?

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,640
How old was this girl?

215
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,040
Young.

216
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,600
She was like 14.

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Okay, okay.

218
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,280
So Victor was like probably 18 or 19 at the time.

219
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
Sounds ripe.

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
Sounds nice and ripe.

221
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
Okay, go on.

222
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,280
Don't, don't.

223
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,400
So Derek says that another friend has said this about Victor.

224
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
Victor, whether Victor doesn't care whether that's true or not,

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
the fact that Derek has brought that up at all,

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
like called that into question at all,

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,520
has infuriated him massively.

228
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
So he goes, tears into him.

229
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,400
He's like, fuck you.

230
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I don't want to see you again for like,

231
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,080
he was like, I don't want to see your face

232
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
for the next six months.

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
You know, and like basically kicked him out.

234
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,880
And everybody was just like, ah,

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,600
and it literally ended drama in my circle of friends.

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,960
Like it was all gone.

237
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,920
Like all of the drama, everything anybody was complaining about,

238
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
all of it was sourced by this one dude.

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
And as soon as he was gone, it was like,

240
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
oh, like we can live again.

241
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
And this is why drama can be beautiful,

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
because it can have results.

243
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't want to be the person that the drama centers around.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
You know, like, that's not a good look.

245
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,840
Like some, some people, some people seem to like,

246
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,680
kind of like drama and get off on it

247
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
and find like pleasure in starting shit.

248
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
But like to me, that's like-

249
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
Didn't we all just admit to that tacitly?

250
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Well, sure.

251
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
And more or less.

252
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
It's not that I enjoy starting shit.

253
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,520
It's that I enjoy ending shit.

254
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm talking about, I'm talking about Derek.

255
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
Well, actually, no, I'm not even talking about anyone.

256
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,720
I'm just talking about, you know,

257
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
there are some people who stir up drama

258
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,120
because it's, it scratches some itch that they need.

259
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
It like gives meaning to their life in some way.

260
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,280
It gives them, it gives them something to do when they're bored.

261
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,560
I'm a big one.

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,280
Oh, go ahead.

263
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,160
But, but, but, you know, it's, it's draining.

264
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,840
It's draining on the people around you.

265
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
And if you are a person like that,

266
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,160
like other people are gonna, if they know what's good for them,

267
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
they're gonna, they're gonna cut you out

268
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,960
because you're a source of problems.

269
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
And like to me, I think that even if

270
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
even if shit's going on, it's better.

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,800
If you can help it, don't fucking turn it into drama

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
and make it everyone else's problem.

273
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,840
That is a bad look.

274
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
And I do not appreciate it.

275
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah.

276
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,840
The thing that interests me about drama

277
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,760
is drama is like a tool that like, I don't know,

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,600
like like the worthless people of society can, excuse me,

279
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
fuck, can wield against like people who actually matter.

280
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
So like the way that people can like start gossip about like,

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
like, like, it's kind of like Jesse's situation recently,

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
you know, like people just talking shit about Jesse forever.

283
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
And it just, it's just an example of this idea

284
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
about how people can, can talk about stuff like that

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
and, and just make it into a big deal

286
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,400
whether or not it was in the first place.

287
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,880
And I, it's, it's this kind of lever of power

288
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:48,960
that people have.

289
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,240
Better example, the PewDiePie Nazi thing,

290
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,080
where it was just, it's just a bunch of old media fuckboys

291
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,160
trying to fuck over the famous guy.

292
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,640
Exactly.

293
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,400
They're like, oh, that guy's got 14 billion subs.

294
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
Let's take him fucking down a peg.

295
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,080
More than the population of the earth.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Yeah.

297
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
It's interesting you bring that up.

298
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
There's like this really interesting video series

299
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
that this guy did about that whole controversy

300
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
and saying how like all, like the two,

301
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
I think it was like NBC and the Wall Street Journal

302
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
or something were the two things that initially reported on this.

303
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,160
And they're both owned by Rupert Murdoch.

304
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
So they were, he was saying like, doing this deep dive,

305
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
like actually had nothing to do with PewDiePie.

306
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,280
It was all an elaborate plan by old media

307
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,200
to make YouTube look like shit.

308
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
So all the advertisers would pull out

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
to make them relevant again.

310
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
Hey.

311
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
It was like, it was like an hour long expose.

312
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
It was super fucking interesting.

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
And it worked.

314
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
Yeah, it worked fantastically.

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,920
So like, oh, Ben, I have a question for you.

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
And this isn't an accusation.

317
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
It's just that with something legitimately,

318
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm legitimately interested in what you just said.

319
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
How, how do you, and I'm not like,

320
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
how would you explain away the fact

321
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
that you take that stance on drama

322
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
and then the whole Rowdy fuckers cop killers?

323
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,760
Like, okay, we need to bring in fans

324
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
aboard to consult on this issue.

325
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,280
Yeah, yeah, let me, let me just go summon him.

326
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm just going to summon him.

327
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,520
Strawberry!

328
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm sweeping.

329
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
Oh, I'm, oh, I'm, but I'm here now.

330
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,520
Let me, let me, let me just pick up,

331
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,280
let me just pick up my like my magic,

332
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,360
my magic fairy wand and do a little like,

333
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,400
like magical girl transformation into fans porn.

334
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,880
Like I always do.

335
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
It's the little toilet paper roll.

336
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,280
After you've taken a shit,

337
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,800
your toilet paper roll like Dover is the magic.

338
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
It's like a scepter.

339
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,720
It's like a scepter with like a glowing like jewel on the,

340
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,280
anyway.

341
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Yeah.

342
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:29,760
Okay.

343
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,080
I'm fine.

344
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
There's like a box next to my desk.

345
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,440
They just have to like,

346
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
like poke the inside pink lizard with a cane

347
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,560
and like fucking like,

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
drum his head and like beat the shit out of them

349
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,120
to wake him up.

350
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
It's like, it's like those old,

351
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,480
it's like those old Power Rangers transform.

352
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Like in the first season of Transformers,

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
when they like wake up the dinosaurs

354
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
and they lumber out of their ancient slumber.

355
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
I'd assume, I'd assume the transformation

356
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,680
for bed would work.

357
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,520
He'd run into a public restroom,

358
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,560
go into a stall,

359
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
get a roll of toilet paper,

360
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,480
stick it on his head,

361
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
and that would start the transformation.

362
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,560
Hold on.

363
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Yeah.

364
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,080
And then it just,

365
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,480
what?

366
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,920
For canonical clarity's sake,

367
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,600
are you implying that Phantom Horn only exists

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
when you are performing Phantom Horn,

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
like when you have become him?

370
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,440
Canonically, no,

371
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
canonically he lives in Ponyville.

372
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,680
Okay.

373
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,920
This, this, this, this, this flight of fancy is merely that.

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,280
All my other flights of fancy are canon.

375
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
See, your pony's thought a retarded

376
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
metapony thing like mine was.

377
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,400
It's a solid stuff.

378
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
That is what makes Peg and Fett

379
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
to the greatest OCS of all time.

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Are only meta in that they canonically

381
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,480
live in Ponyville,

382
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
but also post to YouTube.

383
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
And review my little pony's reviews.

384
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
Yeah, yeah, they watch the show in world.

385
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,880
And like, yeah.

386
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
Strawberry milk lives in my house

387
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,680
and he doesn't pay rent,

388
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
even though he's Dragon Royalty

389
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,400
and he's just crashed out of my house

390
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,320
and they can rap day in, day out.

391
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,680
He won't fucking pay rent,

392
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,040
no matter how much they want to.

393
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah, sorry.

394
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
This is a terrible fucking off time.

395
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
Okay, well, all right,

396
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
the thing about that,

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,960
the thing about the Rowdy,

398
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,240
Munchy, I don't know if you agree with this,

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
but I'm just gonna speak for myself for a minute.

400
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,080
Of course.

401
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't feel like the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers

402
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,240
was stirring up real drama.

403
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,560
I don't.

404
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Because let's just be fucking frank.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
Nobody really gives a shit what FNGR

406
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
or Miss Anthropony or anyone else on that thing.

407
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, give us a primer.

408
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,360
Give us a primer.

409
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,520
I don't think everybody who listens to this

410
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
is gonna know what the fuck

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,280
the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers is.

412
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.

413
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Okay, yeah, yeah.

414
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,880
What?

415
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,080
Like, basically,

416
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers is like a,

417
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,240
I guess, a let's play show

418
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
that me and Ben have,

419
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,400
but it's so much more than that

420
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
in every single possible way.

421
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,680
It's evolved.

422
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,760
And when we start playing Frog Fractions,

423
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,640
the infamous Homestuck spinoff game,

424
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,280
we eventually just get so bored

425
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,240
and we are using like a screen sharing software.

426
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
So I just start tabbing over outside of the Flash game

427
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
and just start googling old pony reviewers

428
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
and we kind of spiral into just shit talking

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
everyone we know from that community

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
for like three hours.

431
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,640
I just started shit talking everyone

432
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,320
that I remembered from the old days

433
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
and like looking at OCs

434
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,120
and being like, oh, god, I hate this

435
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
and like talking about what was wrong

436
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,440
with the whole thing.

437
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
And it incurred,

438
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
it incurred some backlash from a couple of dudes.

439
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
I believe, I believe,

440
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,000
did you refer to as the most like,

441
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,960
something along the lines of like,

442
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
the most like haphazardly,

443
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
feminist thing he's ever seen?

444
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
I have a lot of venom.

445
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
I have a lot of venom on the subject.

446
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
It was a lot of piss and vinegar.

447
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,080
It was the most,

448
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,200
I don't remember the word I used,

449
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,040
but it's, it's a word that means

450
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
like you just didn't think about it.

451
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,800
Like that this was going to come out

452
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,760
and be public

453
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,200
and people were going to watch it.

454
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,600
Like.

455
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,840
No, but I know, I know, I know, I liked it.

456
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,480
We knew.

457
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
And that's, that's incredible to me.

458
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
The way I felt,

459
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,840
it was like, I'd been,

460
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,520
I'd been sitting on these feelings for so like,

461
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
I didn't want to come out with this

462
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,320
when like leaving the pony thing was fresh.

463
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,760
I didn't want to be the kind of guy

464
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
who like came out and shit on all like the people

465
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,440
I'd previously been associating with.

466
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,200
But now that this is like years in the past,

467
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,080
who gives a shit?

468
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
And I'm like, let me just talk.

469
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,520
I'd like to, I'd like to point out

470
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,600
that I am literally wearing my brony shirt

471
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,240
right now.

472
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,480
Very fucking moment.

473
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,280
All right.

474
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,320
But anyway, after that initial shit talking,

475
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
which we basically went on like the wiki

476
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
for all these people

477
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
and just went on each of their pages

478
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
and shit talk them for maybe like 30 minutes each

479
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
or you know, less beyond how relevant they are.

480
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
And we kind of dug into a couple of people

481
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,360
for like hours.

482
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,480
Dr. Will.

483
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,440
Which was great.

484
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah.

485
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
Which was very fun.

486
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,640
It was all, it was all good and fun.

487
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,120
And like, you know, it was pretty great.

488
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,040
Anyway, we get attacked by fucking, you know, assassins,

489
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,680
a top grade brony assassins named Miss Anthropony

490
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,720
for no good reason.

491
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Coming at us with fucking, you know,

492
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
venom and fucking poison,

493
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
trying to, you know, ruin our day

494
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
and ran on our parade.

495
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,840
Before you go further,

496
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
we should probably point out

497
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
that for no good reason is a name,

498
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,320
even though Miss Anthropony basically did just

499
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
try and come at you for no good reason.

500
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Yeah.

501
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,240
Right.

502
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
For no good reason is a person, sort of.

503
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,680
Yeah.

504
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,480
Nominally.

505
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Strangely.

506
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
He's a changed,

507
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
maybe he was a human creature.

508
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,560
And then after that, we recorded,

509
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
we basically, what we did is,

510
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
we made a response video

511
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
to Miss Anthropony and FNGR's video.

512
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
And after that, which was also like five hours long,

513
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
then we made like a seven hour long video

514
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,800
where we invite FNGR on to watch,

515
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,760
for us to watch our response to his video,

516
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
of his video responding to us.

517
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
So basically it's a clusterfuck

518
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
and all you need to know is that

519
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,120
Bronies hate us now,

520
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
even though we're the saviors they deserve

521
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
and we're telling them everything we need to.

522
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
So, well the reason why I can feel this way

523
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
about drama and not see any conflict

524
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,520
with what we did on Rowdyfuckers' cop killers

525
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
is that this is not a real fight, you know?

526
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
Like this is not, like nobody,

527
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
at least nobody who's relevant to us

528
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
is, like nobody who's on board with the PCP

529
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,680
in any way is going to side with them.

530
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
Like this is, this is, this is mean,

531
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
like their opinions do not mean anything.

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,640
And it's just funny.

533
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,040
Miss Anthropony, in the comments of this video,

534
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
I think would argue otherwise.

535
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
Well, they know he will do.

536
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
I don't even have any particular ill will

537
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,360
towards Miss Anthropony,

538
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
even though I think that his arguments were pretty dumb.

539
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,040
But like, it's not a real fight,

540
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
like it's just funny and it's just like

541
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
a chance to like have like a good time

542
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
just shitting on some people, you know,

543
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,480
that I feel like deserve.

544
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
Even if Miss Anthropony, whatever,

545
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
like that seems to resolve.

546
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,920
And FNGR certainly seemed to have an attitude

547
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,200
of not sincere like investment in this like fight.

548
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
He seemed to, you know, so I don't know.

549
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
Well, I don't know what's that scoundrel.

550
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,520
I knew I was making people mad,

551
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
but I didn't, I feel, I felt like we were pretty safe

552
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
that this was not going to result

553
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,560
in any like meaningful schism

554
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,960
among like the people that are important to us.

555
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,680
I, and that's, that brings me to one of the things,

556
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,440
the things about drama.

557
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,560
Every time I get into drama, people are like,

558
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,080
why would you do that

559
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,560
when you're going to make some people so mad?

560
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,480
And it's because there's always going to be

561
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,400
just as many people who are like really glad somebody said it.

562
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,440
You know, like, if there's a problem,

563
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,560
then probably a lot of people have that problem, you know.

564
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,520
And when I call like,

565
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
when I did the shit talking anime YouTubers video,

566
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,280
which is like a very infamous drama sparking video I made,

567
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
30 minutes of me shit talking a bunch of anime YouTubers,

568
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,880
like it got, first of all,

569
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,960
it brought up conversation with all those guys.

570
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,040
I ended up talking to all those YouTubers, you know,

571
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,280
like coming to greater understandings.

572
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,000
Lots of people were like, yeah, I echo these sentiments

573
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,080
and you know, every, literally everyone I mentioned in the video

574
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,200
gained shitloads of subscribers and patrons.

575
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Like it was because it just drew attention to people

576
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,200
and drew attention to things, you know, like anybody I praised,

577
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
people were like, oh, I got to see why he praised that guy.

578
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,040
Anybody insulted, they're like,

579
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,360
let me see if I agree with these insults, you know.

580
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
So like in the end,

581
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,680
and this is why drama is such a hot commodity on YouTube now,

582
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,160
which I, to clarify,

583
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,280
none of my drama videos have been for popularity's sake.

584
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,400
If I wanted that, I would go way harder on it.

585
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
But like, there's a good reason it works for that.

586
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
And it's because people want to be,

587
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
it's, it warps you into the conversation.

588
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
Like more and more people keep involving themselves in the drama

589
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
to bring attention to themselves.

590
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,040
And in ergo, the drama grows and becomes a bigger and bigger deal.

591
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,120
And therefore, more and more people want to pile on it.

592
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,800
And so it's just, it's just really beneficial for everybody involved.

593
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,760
But you know, it's, it's vapid content.

594
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

595
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
The thing here with Rafferty's Cop Killers

596
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
is that first of all, the original video is not a directed attack

597
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
at any one person,

598
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,440
but is instead us degrading a certain mindset and community as a whole.

599
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
Of course, we pick out certain people,

600
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
but those are only symptoms of the larger problem

601
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
that we have both faced individually within our lives.

602
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,160
So it's not directed, and it's not exactly the most, you know,

603
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
you know, like trained, you know,

604
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
calculated video as he stayed many times.

605
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
It's just, you know, us riffing.

606
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,880
And I think that kind of plays into the atmosphere.

607
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
Well, you know, you gotta play these things case by case.

608
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,640
It's not like, you know, not everything can be judged by the exact same merits.

609
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,560
And I think Rafferty's Cop Killers can easily,

610
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,040
well, you know, it could obviously be taken as wrong as it was by the people who we shit on.

611
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,160
A lot of people I don't think would even consider it a drama video per se.

612
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,960
It is just us talking as we always do.

613
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,440
I mean, you know, PZP shits on a lot of people all the time, 100% in fact.

614
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,040
So I don't think it's that far out, you know, out of left.

615
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,280
I just, like, the thing is, like, anyone who's on the side of the Brown Alice's community,

616
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
I think they're dumb.

617
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,040
And I don't want, I don't care if they're mad at me.

618
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,840
There shouldn't even, there shouldn't need to be a divide.

619
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,920
Like, Brody Analysis Community versus, like, Ben and Munchy.

620
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,880
Because, like, you specifically attack individuals,

621
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
which is, like, kind of the whole point of it.

622
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
Like, the individual people are shit.

623
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
To have that kind of group mentality, like, oh, we need to, like, look out for our own?

624
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,200
Yeah.

625
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,920
No, you don't.

626
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,640
No, you don't.

627
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Lightning Bliss is an idiot.

628
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,080
And she makes terrible shit.

629
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
The weird group mentality is what we, like, is what, like,

630
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
I go, like, almost, or one of the hardest things that I hit on.

631
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,240
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
That's not, as being not a fan of.

633
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,720
And, yeah, the final, but the final chapter closed, we laid all our enemies to waste

634
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
in the final episode of the Frog Fraction Saga.

635
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
Rowdy fuckers, cop killers, nine, Frog Fractions, episode two,

636
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,800
Frog Fractions two, part three, Frog Finale.

637
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,360
RFCK9FFE2FF2P3FF.

638
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,080
Wait, is that out?

639
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,800
Is that the latest one?

640
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,720
That's the latest one.

641
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,320
I just wanted to make the title as long and as obnoxious an abbreviation.

642
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,920
We completely melted and dissolved their avatars.

643
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,400
And now we have, we have fucking add them to our stew,

644
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
and we have consumed their entire being.

645
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,160
We have consumed our entire consciousness.

646
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,600
And now we have gained complete and total control over both their Kundalini

647
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
and their Merkaba.

648
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
And now we can drive them as we see fit.

649
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
We took, we took their polygons and added them to our character models.

650
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,000
And now we're like, now we're HD.

651
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Well, okay.

652
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,320
I want to talk about, like, why I think we can get away with,

653
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,920
with some of this stuff that we do, because like,

654
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,080
I think the PCP being such a strong foundation for all of us,

655
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,560
kind of allows us to like burn other bridges.

656
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,360
Like, there's a lot of people, I know content creators who will never say a mean thing

657
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,040
about another content creator, because they're just terrified of burning any bridge.

658
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,240
They're like, I want to be able to work with all these guys in the future.

659
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,040
And, and like, you know, I'll, there'll be people who I know everyone has a problem with

660
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,760
and I bring them up around people and they go, oh, yeah, you know,

661
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,720
he's a little, uh, you know, he's, he's him.

662
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,160
And I'm like, yeah, like, yeah, you're not going to say anything about it.

663
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,680
You know, like, no, I want to be able to work with them in the future.

664
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,640
I think with us, like, we, we know we've got these guys out though.

665
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,760
It's not a cop out.

666
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,680
It totally is to say that you want to work.

667
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,280
If you don't like them, of course, you don't want to work them.

668
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,400
You don't want to start any shit.

669
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
You don't want to be the guy that has the first stone.

670
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,880
Yeah.

671
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,040
And for me, it's like, I already know I've got the PCP, you know,

672
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,520
at the very least, I've got this group of friends

673
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,680
and, and business associates that I don't have any problems with

674
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,760
who I can work with, you know.

675
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,520
And, and so everybody else is like, uh, like, look,

676
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,920
I don't need to have a thousand friends.

677
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,760
I don't need to have a thousand connections.

678
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,800
You know, I'm really, if insulting this guy means like

679
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,840
his entire fan base hates me from now on, cool.

680
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,560
I'll be over here with this other fan base who also hates that guy.

681
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,720
You know, I think, I think an important distinction here to be made

682
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,880
is that like in the, like in the, uh, you know, fucking definition,

683
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
drama is about like nothing.

684
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,880
Like, like the kind of drama that everyone, you know, hates

685
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
and, you know, dislikes makes fun of,

686
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
is kind of drama that is about nothing.

687
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,400
When you have like legitimate problems with people,

688
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,920
obviously it can still be considered drama,

689
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,440
but it's more pointed and, you know, constructive and important

690
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
and actually, you know, worth having around as a species,

691
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
as opposed to just someone disliking someone for,

692
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,920
you know, miscellaneous reasons

693
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,640
and just bringing up like, like just kind of waiting for them to do,

694
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,920
you know, like the PewDiePie thing.

695
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,600
He didn't do anything wrong.

696
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,760
You people just wanted to, you know, take him down a peg

697
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
or I guess in the conspiracy theory just destroy what you do.

698
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
You could argue that what PewDiePie said is not cool for whatever reason,

699
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
but like, I know that's not why they went so hard about it.

700
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Exactly, exactly.

701
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,160
So I'm trying to say.

702
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
What about, what about, would you call,

703
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,360
would you call what like the things happening right now

704
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,800
with guys like like Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey that's like,

705
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,240
you know, like molestation allegations and whatnot, sexual harassment.

706
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,800
Is that drama or is that like something else?

707
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,840
That's like a legal issue.

708
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,560
You know, I think it's, it's like a lawsuit, which is not.

709
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, but I think it's both because I think that what those guys have done,

710
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,240
yeah, that's obviously a legal issue and like it deserves to be brought,

711
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,400
like brought to light probably, but the motivations for bringing it to light

712
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
are by the way, by the way.

713
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Here's the problem with that whole thing.

714
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
There's, there's two sides to it.

715
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,440
There's the legal issues, which is like, hey, you diddle the dude,

716
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,360
that's bad, probably shouldn't do that.

717
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,240
That's, that's not good.

718
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,200
We can all agree on that.

719
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
There's, there's also the people like who hop on the bandwagon like,

720
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,000
yeah, it happened to me too, by somebody, somewhere, sometime,

721
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,360
please pay attention to me.

722
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,040
I want to keep this fire burning.

723
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,640
And it's like, you're not sure if you cared about the actual legal issues,

724
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,680
you would, you would actually constructively solve the problem,

725
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,080
but you don't, you just want to keep the fire burning.

726
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,360
Cause again, like they're very, they started as an observer.

727
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,320
They feel empathetic towards the cause, but they don't,

728
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,480
again, they don't want to cast that stone.

729
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,200
So they're going to, they're going to take that half step of like,

730
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm going to make this a bigger problem,

731
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,120
but I'm not going to actually incriminate myself in any way

732
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
or actively get involved.

733
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
That's like, that's like people, people taking like,

734
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
like monkey talked about, like taking the Elliot Rogers thing

735
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
and like, like taking, taking something else that happened

736
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,480
and using it as like a platform for their, for their agenda.

737
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,760
Right. Yeah. Good point.

738
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,320
That's what a lot of people are doing with this whole sexual

739
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
drama thing right now.

740
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,120
And that's when you, when you do that.

741
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah. When you do it that way, that's drama.

742
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,880
By the way, I'd like to come out real quick

743
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,160
and castigate the guy who came forward with the allegations

744
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,360
against Kevin Spacey.

745
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,040
Why the fuck didn't you wait till season six

746
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,000
of house of cards was done?

747
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
You piece of shit.

748
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,720
You're literally fucking me right now.

749
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
You're fucking me right now.

750
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,800
This is rape.

751
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,640
This is fucking rape. Congratulations.

752
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,880
You are the monster that you claim to fight against.

753
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,720
When I heard those, the allegations I heard

754
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,680
were that he like flirted with him.

755
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,400
Like, did he even actually do anything to him?

756
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I have no idea.

757
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
I have no idea what the situation is.

758
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,800
If you can even look at somebody the wrong way,

759
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,600
it's rape now.

760
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,400
Okay. Okay.

761
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,440
Let me spell it out.

762
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
There's, let's keep this light, guys.

763
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
The first allegation against Kevin Spacey was just that

764
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
like he basically tried to have sex with a 14-year-old,

765
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,600
not like super aggressively, but somewhat,

766
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,520
which is like fucked up and you know, pretty weird.

767
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,760
Sure.

768
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,680
But Kevin was such a fucking beta.

769
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
He couldn't even get with a 14-year-old.

770
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
He easily overpowered, but he fucking said it.

771
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,000
And this was over 30 years ago.

772
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
So like that one's a little bit shaky.

773
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,680
Who knows?

774
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Okay, but like the new ones are like people working on the set with him

775
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,320
on House of Cards, like since the beginning of the show,

776
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,800
are saying like, oh, he's like groped guys

777
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,920
and made inappropriate comments,

778
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
which all sound very nebulous.

779
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
And I don't like, what's your actual core testimony for this?

780
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,560
I mean, as Stereo's Kokano said,

781
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,400
that he's been hearing rumors about this for like 15 years or something.

782
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
So I'm willing to believe.

783
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,400
Okay.

784
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,240
As someone tweeted,

785
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
someone tweeted that like family guy made a joke

786
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
about Kevin Spacey having like sex slaves in his basement,

787
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,280
which like I feel like maybe might have like colored the waters for something.

788
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,760
Like maybe some people heard that and internalized it.

789
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,480
Or maybe that was based on true.

790
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,600
Yeah, I don't know.

791
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,160
I don't know.

792
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay.

793
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,160
On one of the episodes that we had Stereo's on,

794
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,920
on the insufferable social media argument,

795
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,120
he was talking about,

796
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
or maybe this was on the dick show.

797
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,800
I don't remember.

798
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
All my fucking Asterios is bleeding into each other.

799
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,560
But he was talking about how in the industry.

800
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,160
The Asterios diaspora.

801
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,320
When something like this happens, there's,

802
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
no, it was on the dick show.

803
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,480
He was talking about the heart, the Weinstein thing,

804
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,040
and how like everyone had known this.

805
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,320
Like this was just something that everybody knew in Hollywood.

806
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,040
And he was like, every time one of these things comes out,

807
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,400
that is always the case.

808
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,840
Like everybody knows there just nobody's going to say anything

809
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,000
until that person's like number is up.

810
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,680
You know, it's just waiting for the pin to drop.

811
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,480
When someone decides that you're next,

812
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
that's when they come for you.

813
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,640
You know, and there's no real,

814
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,080
I mean, to me, it's like, it's never surprising

815
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,440
because it's like you've got to be,

816
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,280
you kind of have to be mentally damaged

817
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,040
in some way to work in entertainment.

818
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,680
You know, like why the fuck else would you be here?

819
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
None of us is sane, I don't think.

820
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Probably any of us qualifies as sane.

821
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

822
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
I do my best.

823
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
I'm cultured.

824
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm a philosopher.

825
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,480
Well, okay, let me.

826
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
So, okay, this is all interesting stuff,

827
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,840
but let me just, so all of you guys,

828
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
to some degree or another,

829
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,560
have involved yourself with some drama-ish situation.

830
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,920
Including Tom.

831
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
Hashtag leaving the fandom.

832
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Hashtag burning breakfast, you know.

833
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,280
See, it's interesting to say that

834
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,720
because I was going to bring up-

835
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,880
This is a really pony-charged episode today,

836
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,680
I didn't expect that.

837
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
We all had a lot of pony trauma.

838
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,720
Well, it's true, it's true.

839
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
It's because that was my one exception,

840
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,160
but for the most part, I think I probably,

841
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,720
in general, I'm the least drama person here,

842
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,680
question mark, maybe.

843
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I have something to say relevant to that.

844
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,800
Oh, well, I didn't mean to interrupt,

845
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
but if I have the floor, I just want to say that-

846
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,560
Well, it's too late now, isn't it, Ben?

847
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,960
The reason why I felt comfortable making that

848
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Dungeons & Dragons Attack video, responding to it,

849
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
and the reason why I jumped on that so quickly,

850
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,520
is because I knew that I could make a counter-argument

851
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,040
to yours, and make it into a thing,

852
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,480
and joke that, like, ah, fuck Tom,

853
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,800
and I knew that it wouldn't escalate into a real-

854
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,880
Yeah, that was hilarious, I loved that.

855
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
I figured that you would appreciate it,

856
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,600
and I thought it was fun, and I was, you know,

857
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,040
glad I saw an opportunity to be like,

858
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,360
yeah, let's make a little thing out of this.

859
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,480
Everybody got the joke.

860
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
That's like anti-drama, almost.

861
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
I mean, it's faux drama, I guess,

862
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,640
and yeah, I think everybody appreciated it,

863
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,280
but the reason-

864
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,920
I, yeah.

865
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,960
Sorry, yeah, finish your point if you're-

866
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,560
I was just gonna say it was great,

867
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,520
and we should, I hope more of that.

868
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,440
We should do more of that here on the PCP.

869
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,040
I already do more of that.

870
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,880
Well, that's something I was gonna bring up, is that-

871
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
But only when there's an issue that I actually-

872
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
Oh, wait, we should make a Patreon goal

873
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,200
for the procrastinators.

874
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
We will start PCP inter-PCP drama with each other.

875
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
We will create an issue for you to love

876
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,400
and latch onto a side, what were you saying, Tom?

877
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,920
We'll just manufacture it.

878
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,160
Well, I was gonna say, I was saying,

879
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,280
I tend to try and avoid drama for the most part,

880
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,800
and when people latch onto stuff,

881
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,720
I tend to not jump into it,

882
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,440
because even now, I still, I don't know,

883
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
I just kind of, even if there's something I want to say,

884
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,680
I don't, and I think that's a problem.

885
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,480
I think that makes my internet personality too boring.

886
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,160
I think I need to start shitting on people.

887
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,800
I think that would do good things for my career.

888
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,040
I feel like-

889
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,160
I have the same fear that I'm not contentious enough.

890
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,720
I just feel like I'm not that interesting.

891
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,360
I feel like because I don't jump into conflicts head-on,

892
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,720
that it's actually actively damaging my prospects going forward.

893
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
Better, better to, what's the saying?

894
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,400
Better to be hated than not to be discussed at all,

895
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
or something like that, you know?

896
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,440
All right, it feels relevant online.

897
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,680
I used to say and think a lot,

898
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
that like what I would really enjoy

899
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,560
is if the PCP did get into some drama,

900
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,720
not like inter-PCP drama,

901
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,800
but like if maybe some other podcast,

902
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
or other show, or other group of creators.

903
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
We need to pick a fight with somebody.

904
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah, with maybe like a similar clout to our own,

905
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,960
like if maybe there's like some genuine,

906
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,240
and some genuine-

907
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
Wait, what did you say?

908
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,160
Art retrieval.

909
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah, I'll pop up the entire thing

910
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,440
so they have no real threat against us,

911
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,480
but we can still attack them mercilessly.

912
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,040
I don't know.

913
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,800
It's controlled drama.

914
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,360
I wouldn't mind if we had like some genuine,

915
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,640
non-manufactured beef with some other group of people

916
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,760
that maybe have like similar,

917
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,520
or like slightly greater clout to us.

918
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
The pony book cast.

919
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,320
And it would be like a fair fight,

920
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,920
and like we would trade blows,

921
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
and people would take sides,

922
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,400
and like people like that kind of thing,

923
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,280
and it could be fun.

924
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,160
Like that's the kind of thing,

925
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,520
like remember back in the pony days,

926
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,800
sorry to bring it back to pony,

927
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
but remember back in the pony days

928
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
when we all saw it as like we're all in Bakuman,

929
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,280
and we're all the fucking,

930
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,520
we're all like competing with each other, right?

931
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
It's like a hot-blooded rivalry.

932
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,440
I don't know, I missed that a little bit.

933
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,920
That sense of needing to best of it.

934
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,240
It drives creation and enthusiasm.

935
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,560
That's true, but the smart business decision for us to be

936
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,160
would be to manufacture drama with a much larger podcast,

937
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,840
like the fucking sleepy cast.

938
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,160
That's true.

939
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,760
We could somehow make drama happen with them,

940
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,120
like that would be the best way

941
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,880
to like suddenly boost our relevancy

942
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,240
if we could do that or something.

943
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,520
Dick Vaster said that he used to constantly like shit-talk

944
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,240
Mark Maron on Biggest Problem and the Dick Show,

945
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,760
like trying to make that happen.

946
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,360
For no reason, just bringing up Mark Maron and being like,

947
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,000
yeah fuck that guy, like just hoping that it wouldn't...

948
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
Who is that guy again?

949
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,600
Mark Maron's like the biggest podcaster in the world.

950
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,440
He's the one who interviewed Obama that time.

951
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,960
Well then why haven't I heard of him?

952
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,680
If he's so great.

953
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,840
He had a fucking show on Netflix, Maron.

954
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,440
I never heard of Netflix.

955
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
When is the PCP Netflix show going to come out?

956
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
Thanks for spoiling Biggest Problem.

957
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,320
And when is there going to be male on male rope

958
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
on that one, huh, Kevin?

959
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,920
It's not much of a spoiler,

960
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
because they never managed to get Mark Maron to fight.

961
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,360
God damn it.

962
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
You spoiled that part for me too.

963
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,800
Here guys, okay.

964
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,400
The reason I brought up this drama, Tom's drama,

965
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm just interested to hear everyone's individual story,

966
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,600
but the reason I bring it up is because

967
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,080
I want to point out how I am literally perfect.

968
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,520
I am an evolved being.

969
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
I am superior to all of you,

970
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
because I have never, ever been involved in drama.

971
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
You're starting some drama right now.

972
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,000
Well Nate, I think the thing about with you not having drama,

973
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,080
you very much have tried to be like a,

974
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,040
in spite of the fact that you're in the PCP,

975
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,680
your YouTube presence has always been very independent.

976
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,960
And like you do not associate as part of a community.

977
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
You do not really like,

978
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
when other people ask you about YouTubers,

979
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,280
it's always either like I watch them or I don't.

980
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,840
It's never like here's what I think they do

981
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
to my content or like what they do to the atmosphere of YouTube.

982
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
Like you don't really care about that kind of shit.

983
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
You're just like, I'm over here in my own world doing my videos,

984
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
you know, which is a healthy way to even how

985
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
most YouTubers probably are.

986
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,760
Nate, Nate can get away with that

987
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
because he has such a natural charisma by default,

988
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,080
where I don't.

989
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,920
So I need something to make me interesting

990
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,840
because right now I'm just a boring piece of shit.

991
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,280
I need to start shit with somebody.

992
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
I also think, Nate, that you would have more drama

993
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,880
if it weren't for the fact that you tend to play things off

994
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,920
in a very playful, like you shit talk people,

995
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,600
it just never starts anything.

996
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,400
Like you will blatantly like just shit on somebody,

997
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
but because you do it with such a like,

998
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,280
like a smiley, laughy gravitas to it,

999
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,120
like nobody really cares.

1000
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,800
Like nobody takes it personally.

1001
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,560
They're just like, oh yeah, well whatever.

1002
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
You know, like when I do it, it's like,

1003
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,960
I get drunk and like tear someone's whole life apart.

1004
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
And like, yeah, yeah.

1005
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,440
It's a different atmosphere behind those sorts of things, you know.

1006
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,560
You can tell there's anger when I start drama.

1007
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,560
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

1008
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,480
I have, I don't, I try not to shit talk people.

1009
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
And I think it's because that if I did,

1010
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,280
it would come off as very like serious and grave.

1011
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
And like, I don't know.

1012
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,040
I can't, I can't.

1013
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
I don't shit talk anyone, says Ben St.

1014
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,600
with 15 hours of rowdy fuckers cop killers.

1015
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,480
Well, they don't care.

1016
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
Well, they don't care.

1017
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,480
Well, Tom, Tom, what the fuck is with you

1018
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,920
and all the boring thing?

1019
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm like, oh, Ben is so mean.

1020
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,760
Ben, Ben did all of this.

1021
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,200
No, I was there too.

1022
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,520
I'm a mean, I'm a bully too.

1023
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,160
Hashtag, what about Munchy?

1024
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,120
Hashtag, what about Munchy?

1025
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm only responding because Ben was talking.

1026
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,200
Munchy, you are just as much of a dick.

1027
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Thank you, Munchy.

1028
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,320
Finally.

1029
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,480
Munchy in many ways has the same thing as Nate,

1030
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
where Munchy's a big memer.

1031
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
So like, people aren't,

1032
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,920
like both of you guys are constantly spouting memes.

1033
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,800
So like, when you guys shit on somebody,

1034
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,200
it's like seen as more of a meme, you know.

1035
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,920
If Ben, who's, Ben is more of like a,

1036
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't know, Ben is a very like funny, lighthearted guy,

1037
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
but he's got a little bit more of like a heady persona,

1038
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,200
where like, if he insults somebody, it's like,

1039
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,200
well fuck, if Ben thinks it, it must be serious, you know.

1040
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,760
Oh, I think Ben just has like that,

1041
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,400
he kind of comes off as a judgmental person

1042
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,360
in general sometimes.

1043
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,760
Oh, Ben is a very judgmental person.

1044
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,560
Jesus.

1045
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,360
So when he does it, you know, it's like,

1046
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,920
I know who this Ben St. character is.

1047
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,440
This isn't for chuckles, this is for real.

1048
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,480
You know what it is, I can be really judgmental sometimes,

1049
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,240
and I don't really like that about myself.

1050
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,960
So I think that I like avoid, not with the pony stuff,

1051
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
but with most things, I try to avoid,

1052
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,240
I try to avoid coming out and like making statements

1053
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,440
like against people because I know that like,

1054
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,160
I don't want to let that out into the public sphere

1055
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,280
because I don't like it, you know.

1056
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,320
I also like to,

1057
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,080
I know that no one's going to appreciate it.

1058
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,320
Wait, hold on, Ben, correct me if I'm wrong here,

1059
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,640
but I feel like you and I and Nate are different in this way.

1060
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,360
I think Nate, when he doesn't like somebody,

1061
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,800
doesn't think about him.

1062
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,160
Like, when somebody brings up a name that like,

1063
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,000
Nate's like, oh, that guy sucks, you know,

1064
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
like it's because Nate like watched one of his videos,

1065
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
thought he sucked in that moment and then forgot,

1066
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,040
and then he hasn't stewed on it.

1067
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,760
With you and me, Ben, we stew on the people we don't like.

1068
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,600
Yeah, I definitely do that to an extremely large extent.

1069
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,120
We sit around, I know we have sat around and like,

1070
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,720
like we all sit around and just shit on people all day.

1071
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Like if there's someone we're both stewing on,

1072
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,760
you know, it becomes a little bit of a circus.

1073
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,600
You know, I try, I try to like keep that down

1074
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,080
and not stew, but like when it comes up,

1075
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,840
I can't help myself.

1076
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,520
Sam, you know, I'm naturally inclined to stew

1077
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,880
and to be like, yeah, fucking,

1078
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,200
here's what I think about this shit and it makes me mad.

1079
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,360
This does kind of, I mean, it sort of is explained by

1080
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
our sort of different approaches to life, I guess,

1081
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,280
because I really am, and here comes your dose

1082
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,120
of hashtag weird utilitarianism.

1083
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,080
All right, well, I expected that to be your whole place

1084
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,920
in this one.

1085
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
That's where I've been trying to steer

1086
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,200
this lumbering massive ship this whole time,

1087
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
and we're moving in that direction now.

1088
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
It's like, I'm always, like,

1089
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm totally pragmatic about this.

1090
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,960
Like what good is done by me dwelling on people I don't care?

1091
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,400
Like just yesterday, I was telling you guys

1092
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,280
about a YouTuber, I have decided now

1093
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,800
I do not care about anymore,

1094
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
and I'm not going to think about them anymore,

1095
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,840
and it's been great, and I have not.

1096
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,600
They broke the bridge and I'm done with them.

1097
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,280
Yeah, like I'm not gonna say, I don't hate the person at all,

1098
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,600
but I appreciate that.

1099
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,320
I appreciate that.

1100
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,960
A while, I don't know.

1101
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,760
And like, I've tried to do that.

1102
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,320
Here, I'll type it.

1103
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,040
I'll type it.

1104
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,800
I've tried to do that with like, I don't know,

1105
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,080
with like, I don't know, people with political opinions

1106
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,520
or social opinions, like the whole Sargon

1107
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,640
and everyone like him that makes me so fucking mad

1108
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,800
to think about, like I just decided,

1109
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
like okay, all I want to do is destroy these people

1110
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,680
and make them not exist, but I can't.

1111
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,320
So the best thing to do, all I can do,

1112
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
all I can do is not watch their content

1113
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,640
and not think about them.

1114
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
That's the only thing at my disposal.

1115
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,120
So yes, when possible, that is my weapon of choice.

1116
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,440
I wish I had the mindset that you have, Nate,

1117
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,280
because for me, people can become like a meme in my mind.

1118
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,840
Oh, I'm fully on your side.

1119
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,000
Munchy me and you, I know you're like this,

1120
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,520
because we need to do this thing where the more we bitch

1121
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,440
about somebody or the more we think about them,

1122
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
the funnier it gets.

1123
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,120
Oh my god, exactly, exactly.

1124
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,960
It's kind of like with Sword Art Online,

1125
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
how like that show, just watching it's a bad show,

1126
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,680
but the more me and Victor made fun of it

1127
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
and talked about it, the funnier it got to me.

1128
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,240
And so like, it got to a point where now I've got like,

1129
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
fucking posters and toys of Sword Art Online

1130
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,840
because I just want to make fun of it.

1131
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,320
And like, it brings me joy to see it.

1132
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,160
And like, I get that way.

1133
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,960
And I don't want to start any drama by saying this,

1134
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,600
but it's exactly what Mother's Basement is for me in my life.

1135
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,160
It's someone who I've made fun of and talked shit about so much

1136
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
and it keeps getting funnier.

1137
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,960
And especially because like, people, for some reason,

1138
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,560
this is not provocated by me, I don't know how this happened,

1139
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,760
other than that, we're sort of around the same sub count,

1140
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,040
the same like kind of around popularity as YouTubers.

1141
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,360
But when people decide they don't like him, they tell me.

1142
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,720
Like people, I like very frequently get messages

1143
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,840
about people being like, oh, I'm real sick of Mother's Basement.

1144
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,880
I'm glad you're still doing this kind of videos you're doing.

1145
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,160
Like, it happens all the time.

1146
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
Do you want to accept this like frightening?

1147
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,280
And I want to be like, like, you know,

1148
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,840
I got to talk to these people and be like, yeah, I see that.

1149
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,960
Like, I see why, you know?

1150
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,400
And so like, somehow when I created my discord,

1151
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,920
like the first thing that happened was like,

1152
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
it became a huge meme to shit on Jeff.

1153
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,640
And I was like, wait, hold on.

1154
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,160
This is starting to get out of hand.

1155
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Like, let's snip this.

1156
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,360
And then Troll started coming in who like recognized this

1157
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,520
and tried to start a war between our discords,

1158
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
which thankfully didn't work because they were fucking retarded.

1159
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,880
But like, you know, and I still,

1160
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,120
I'll still work with Jeff on some things.

1161
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,400
You know, I don't hate the guy,

1162
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,080
but like it became so funny to make fun of him

1163
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,680
that now he has a big meme.

1164
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,160
When you start drama with someone and like,

1165
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,400
and you focus on them so much, like, like,

1166
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,040
initially there's no, there's no like funny parts there,

1167
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,000
at least most of the time.

1168
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
It's just like, man, I fucking hate this guy.

1169
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,320
But the more you dwell on him and like,

1170
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,080
talk to other people with it, especially,

1171
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,960
you sort of get this like,

1172
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,200
character in your brain of like,

1173
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
like you pick out all the words parts of it

1174
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,280
and then you just create this horrible monstrosity

1175
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,840
of all the worst possible aspects of that person.

1176
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,560
And just watch them dance around in your brain.

1177
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,000
I won't say who, I won't say who in this call,

1178
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,600
I did that with, with Jeff,

1179
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,440
that turned him into a meme in my mind.

1180
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,240
But what if he was partially responsible for that?

1181
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,720
That, that, that isn't,

1182
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,560
Jeff is an example of where I have taken

1183
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,840
the opposite of approach,

1184
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,680
because thinking about Jeff feels,

1185
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,720
feels bad to me.

1186
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,120
Thinking about, thinking about someone like Jeff,

1187
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,240
thinking about someone like Jeff,

1188
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,920
turning out, turning out content

1189
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,520
that is like designed for SEO optimization and stuff,

1190
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,840
like turning it out mechanically and like,

1191
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,440
get like, wheeling and dealing and like,

1192
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,240
getting industry connections due to this fucking,

1193
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,320
this whatever it is and people,

1194
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,120
but more so than that,

1195
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,920
more so than him doing it,

1196
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,760
the thought of people buying into it,

1197
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,000
this goes the same for like someone like Dr. Wolfe

1198
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,800
on like a larger scale,

1199
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,280
the idea of someone doing that and people buying into it

1200
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,960
upsets me and makes me mad.

1201
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,360
And so like, while it is kind of funny sometimes,

1202
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,240
ultimately the laughter dies and I just sit there stupid.

1203
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,320
In my impotent, impotent rage and the best thing to do

1204
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,520
is just stop thinking about it.

1205
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,240
As funny as the meme, as funny as it is

1206
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,120
to make fun of Jeff,

1207
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,760
I do eventually enter that state where I'm like,

1208
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,320
well, I can, I can laugh at this all I want,

1209
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,640
but that motherfucker's laugh into the bank.

1210
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,000
You know, that guy's making way more money

1211
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,080
than me at the end of the day.

1212
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,600
And no matter how many of his fans leave him

1213
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,680
to come bitch to me about him,

1214
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,440
he'll always have more fans coming in.

1215
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,480
It's just about what kind of,

1216
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
what do you want your life to be like?

1217
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,120
You know, whatever.

1218
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,320
Jeff can do whatever he wants.

1219
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,880
I guess I should focus more on the drama itself.

1220
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,320
Yeah, I don't know.

1221
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,280
Tom, you were saying something.

1222
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,560
I just take everything to like the worst degree possible

1223
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,120
with this because I have the same issue where I don't,

1224
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
the only people that bother me are people

1225
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,680
who are shittier than me and make more money

1226
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,840
or have more respect because fuck that.

1227
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,520
Or people that are a different race.

1228
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,000
That's how I feel.

1229
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,880
That's a big issue for me too.

1230
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
That's how I feel about every single one of you.

1231
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,560
There's like the Nate method where there's like one stage

1232
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,360
or just like fuck it.

1233
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,480
I don't care anymore.

1234
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,400
And by the way, I want to point out that that stage,

1235
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,000
this is not like a lighthearted thing.

1236
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,840
This is a cold calculated.

1237
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,480
This is the optimal way to destroy these people.

1238
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,840
I would expect nothing less than you, Nate.

1239
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,560
Of course it was.

1240
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,200
Yes, good.

1241
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,920
I come off lighthearted, but I want to destroy people.

1242
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,600
I have that seething desire.

1243
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,720
Okay, go on.

1244
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,880
Then there's the Ben.

1245
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,000
Just kidding, I'm fun.

1246
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,560
Hey guys, send me messages.

1247
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,840
There's the Ben and Digi approach

1248
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,000
where you try not to care, but you can't.

1249
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,080
And then it gets funny and then it becomes bad.

1250
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,640
For me, it's like I try not to care.

1251
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,600
Then I get mad.

1252
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,760
And then I'm just like, well, the problem is me.

1253
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,120
I should be doing better.

1254
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,480
And then I just get mad at myself.

1255
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,360
And that's what I do.

1256
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,240
Oh, right, all right.

1257
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,880
That's tough.

1258
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,600
That's tough.

1259
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,880
I have the skills.

1260
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
There's no reason why this shouldn't be working.

1261
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,480
And then I just hate myself.

1262
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,360
And that's the worst.

1263
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,360
I have an element to that with the Jeff thing,

1264
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,200
where sometimes I'm like,

1265
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
but why am I not doing what he's doing?

1266
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,080
Like, that man is going to surpass me.

1267
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,920
And for most people, they won't be able to tell the difference.

1268
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,040
Like, I can sit here and say like, oh, I make real content.

1269
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,520
He doesn't, not so much so that it's a huge difference.

1270
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
That only matters to you, right?

1271
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,840
Yeah, me and my fans, yeah.

1272
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,440
But like, to the average Joe.

1273
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
To the public at large, the numbers.

1274
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,320
It's like that fucking goodwill hunting thing

1275
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,400
about how Will is like the super genius,

1276
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,080
but he's so good at math and shit.

1277
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,480
The only people who even recognize he's that good

1278
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,520
are like fellow genius math people who just aren't white.

1279
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,720
And I'm not trying to suck your dick here.

1280
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,440
You're fucking pathetic.

1281
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,160
You're a piece of shit.

1282
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,120
I hate you.

1283
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,680
But I am the one I'm talking about in this situation.

1284
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,360
He smiles.

1285
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,960
Terry, did you laugh a lot?

1286
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,360
That's the genius, the, what's it called?

1287
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,600
Like the genius paradox or some shit like that?

1288
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,560
Basically, you can understand people who are like either

1289
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,600
like 30 points below or 30 points above you in IQ.

1290
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,000
And anything beyond that, like if it's less than,

1291
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,600
or if it's more than 30 points less,

1292
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,680
then they just seem like a fucking retard.

1293
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,520
And if it's more than 30 points more,

1294
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,360
they seem like a fucking god

1295
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,040
and you can't understand what's coming out of their mouth.

1296
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,640
Like that episode of a regular show.

1297
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,920
Right from his cop killers.

1298
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,720
It's just too big.

1299
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,640
We're 7,000 IQ points above the pronounces community

1300
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,160
and they call me a neighboring retard.

1301
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,040
They say that like the best play,

1302
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
if you want to be like a businessman,

1303
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,000
the best place to be is in like the 100 to 110 range of IQ.

1304
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,200
Because you can, you can, you can sell stuff to idiots.

1305
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,320
You can sell stuff to normies.

1306
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,160
You can sell stuff to people who are kind of smart.

1307
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,840
And you don't got to worry about the extremes.

1308
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,200
I think everybody in the PCP sits around

1309
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,160
anywhere from like 125 to 145, you know?

1310
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,680
Like we're all in this upper level.

1311
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,120
And like, so when we get down,

1312
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,760
when we get down to the people who are like IQ 80,

1313
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,280
like Ms. Anthropony.

1314
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,680
Damn.

1315
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,760
It's like you just, you can't, you can't.

1316
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,800
Start drama again right here.

1317
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
Do you, do you think Ms. Anthropony has an IQ above 100?

1318
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,840
Ms. Anthropony, I have no problem with you.

1319
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,440
You tried your best out there buddy.

1320
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,760
I don't know enough about IQ to make statements like that.

1321
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,080
Oh, it doesn't make you a better or worse person to be stupid.

1322
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,840
It just makes it so people like me

1323
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,520
can't positively fathom how you think.

1324
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,480
I'm glad, I'm glad according to Digi,

1325
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,200
we all have excuses now for why we love Morgan Morty so much.

1326
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,560
I won't make any sweeping statements about the man,

1327
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,960
but his arguments in the videos directed at me

1328
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,280
did not give the impression of overwhelming intelligence.

1329
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,200
I've seen Digi's content since back in the pony days,

1330
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,800
when he made videos, by the way,

1331
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,800
shitting on all of us, and yet is somehow like the biggest fan.

1332
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
I'd like to point out for the record that,

1333
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,040
as far as I know, mine is the only one that's still up,

1334
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,760
even though it was-

1335
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,800
Oh, is that true?

1336
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,520
Oh, really?

1337
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,640
Wait, you won.

1338
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,080
His attack video by Ms. Anthropony?

1339
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,600
Yeah, he deleted all the other ones,

1340
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,840
but he made mine and then put the apology

1341
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,600
at the end of mine and kept it up.

1342
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,160
What?

1343
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:22,320
Yeah.

1344
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,200
Great, great.

1345
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,040
Which I always found was kind of funny.

1346
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,280
That is very amusing.

1347
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,920
So that's the most I'm going to get into that drama is that.

1348
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,800
That was kind of weird.

1349
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
No offense to you Ms. Anthropony, you might be fine,

1350
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,480
but I'm just saying, you might not be the most intelligent person.

1351
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,520
And that's fine.

1352
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,840
The statement that did you, bro, do not reflect the-

1353
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,160
I think there's some intent,

1355
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,520
offense going to come through there.

1356
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,960
Is Ms. Anthropony a patron?

1357
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,440
Should I be?

1358
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,560
Hey, we're just breaking ball.

1359
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,000
Oh, he should be getting it out of this.

1360
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,400
I don't know.

1361
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,520
We're just breaking ball.

1362
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,720
No, no, no editing, no filter, nothing.

1363
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,440
Yeah, this is all good.

1364
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,320
This is all going on.

1365
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,480
In fact, it's going to be echoed so they hear it twice.

1366
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,960
Now I feel bad because Ms. Anthropony

1367
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,080
like comments on this channel and like really likes the show.

1368
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,080
Yeah, he does.

1369
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,680
Look, we're just joking around here.

1370
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,640
Right guys, right?

1371
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,480
He's the one who shits on you all the time.

1372
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Like, he did, he did.

1373
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,960
He did, but it didn't make me feel bad

1374
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,000
because it just bounced off

1375
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,440
because it didn't mean anything to me.

1376
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,080
Because it seemed to make Jackie pretty mad.

1377
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,840
She was pretty fucking pissed.

1378
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,280
She did, she got pretty mad.

1379
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,280
I'm not going to specify, I'm going to keep it vague here,

1380
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,920
but why was that Benz just a week ago?

1381
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,360
It was the most euphoric time

1382
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,480
because every time we got on the car

1383
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,680
we just hot boxed insults about like the various people

1384
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,640
within our lives.

1385
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,160
And it was just like a drama hot box

1386
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,480
where we were just high on vapes and anger.

1387
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,960
And we just fucking, we just rode to Valhalla.

1388
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,520
It sounds like a normal day in the St. household.

1389
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,480
Yeah, that's true.

1390
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,040
Yeah, pretty much.

1391
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,080
It was very cathartic though.

1392
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,960
Did they get you to vape?

1393
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,320
Did they convince you to vape?

1394
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:52,880
No, no.

1395
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,920
Please say no.

1396
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,520
Please don't let that disgusting substance

1397
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,720
touch your lips, Mudgey.

1398
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,000
Thank you, thank you.

1399
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,200
My horse, my horse, my voice got so hoarse

1400
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,040
and like my voice wouldn't work

1401
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,360
because I just inhaled so much secondhand vape

1402
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,200
that my voice just got so fucking high

1403
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,480
I couldn't speak anymore.

1404
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,880
It was really, it was, it was really awful.

1405
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,560
Like, like, like after like an entire day

1406
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,480
I just was like, hey, I can't, Ben,

1407
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,160
I need some pizza, please.

1408
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,640
I just couldn't fucking, I just couldn't speak anymore.

1409
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,960
I actually believe that's possible in a car

1410
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,360
with Ben and Jackie because they vape way harder

1411
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,800
than normal people vape.

1412
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,440
Yeah.

1413
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,760
Like when Jackie, when Jackie pulls a vape,

1414
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,720
there's a fucking clown after they have fucking vape.

1415
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,080
Yeah, there's a haze, there's a haze in the house.

1416
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,720
I was surrounded by vape, I was surrounded by fog

1417
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,400
the entire time I was at Ben's house.

1418
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,840
The fucking neighborhood children

1419
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,680
gather outside the St. House windows

1420
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,640
to inhale that sweet cloud coming out of the practical wall.

1421
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,560
Jackie hits the vape like, like asthmatics hit a,

1422
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
like a truck hitting a brick fucking wall.

1423
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,360
What does the vape, what does the fucking thing

1424
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,520
call that goddamn asthmatics he uses?

1425
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,960
I don't even know who that is, Doug.

1426
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,840
An inhaler.

1427
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,440
Jackie hits that vape, like my dad hit my mom when I came out.

1428
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,280
Hey.

1429
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,840
My deepest, my deepest apologies for your

1430
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,600
oncoming emphysema.

1431
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,680
Indeed.

1432
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,960
I'll never forgive you.

1433
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,280
Okay guys, let's, let's center ourselves here.

1434
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,400
Yeah, center our chakras.

1435
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,400
Let's, let's talk about how drama has objectively

1436
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
zero worth and is a waste of all your time

1437
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
to even engage it in, even a little bit.

1438
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,640
I completely disagree, but I'm, this is what I can't hear

1439
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,280
to argue with.

1440
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,320
That's what I want to talk about.

1441
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,280
Because the, the, the, the rowdy fucker stuff was fun

1442
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,800
and you know, people liked it.

1443
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,960
It was a great time.

1444
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,600
It was completely fun to record and it was fun for all

1445
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,160
of our audience.

1446
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,920
It was fun for the whole family and everyone

1447
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,480
enjoyed it.

1448
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,120
I see, I see, I see the rowdy fucker stuff

1449
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,680
as kind of like a version of like the digi

1450
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,120
and that anime snob thing.

1451
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,040
Cause it's like, like it's fun to shit on someone like that.

1452
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,120
And like all at the end of the day, who gives a shit

1453
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,920
what they have to say.

1454
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,040
There's nothing at stake.

1455
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,360
Both snob and F and GR, they deserve it because

1456
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,280
they're dishing it out constantly.

1457
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,080
And it's all anybody wants to see is for someone to come along.

1458
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,160
Just want to go on, just want to go on the record and say

1459
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,520
that F and GR is far inferior to Miss Anthropony.

1460
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
F and GR is by far the greater building.

1461
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,840
Oh, oh, oh yeah.

1462
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,880
Miss Anthropony, I honestly don't have that much

1463
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,720
hard feelings towards, you know, I don't like what

1464
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,760
he said about me and, and my, and my brother, but you

1465
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,000
know what, uh, F and GR is far worse.

1466
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,360
And honestly, he should be eliminated from the game.

1467
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,240
He should be himself.

1468
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh my God, he needs to be removed from the board.

1469
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,880
My 20 player kill streak should end with all of him

1470
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,640
being each 20 players that I kill.

1471
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,720
And that's how I feel about the subject.

1472
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,680
Okay, okay.

1473
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,600
F and GR and that anime snob are both dudes who thrive on drama,

1474
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,920
who think for some reason that everybody wants it.

1475
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,400
Like, like that everybody wants them to do that.

1476
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,640
And, and no, like, no, no one really does.

1477
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,600
That's the excuse they make.

1478
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:55,840
Yeah.

1479
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,480
That's the excuse they make.

1480
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,760
And I think that in both cases, there's a huge amount

1481
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,480
of people just waiting in the wings, hoping someone

1482
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,080
destroys these guys.

1483
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,840
Yeah, they're not very smart.

1484
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,360
And most people won't bother.

1485
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,520
Like with, with that anime snob, like what, what

1486
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
everybody always told me is like, just don't, don't

1487
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,440
bother with them because like, what's the point?

1488
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,920
You know, you're not going to change it.

1489
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,640
I think I told you that too, but in hindsight, I, I

1490
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,880
under, because on the one hand I hated that anime

1491
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,280
snob and I didn't want him to gain the exposure

1492
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,520
that would inevitably come from me talking about him.

1493
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,400
But, but now with the benefit of hindsight, I can see

1494
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,280
like why you would just for your own enjoyment and for

1495
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,840
your own like catharsis.

1496
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,080
Well, the thing about snob and FNGR is that they

1497
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,680
will never stop.

1498
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,720
They're both, both of those guys are in their late 30s.

1499
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,800
Both of those are guys in their late 30s who've

1500
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,120
been on the internet for decades who have been

1501
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,680
doing the same thing forever and will continue to.

1502
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,360
FNGR is still making weekly videos about the My Little

1503
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,920
Pony fandom in 2017.

1504
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,920
No, November 2017.

1505
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,400
Like nothing's going to stop those two guys from

1506
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,520
continuing to do that.

1507
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,920
So like you're not going to, people are like, oh, if

1508
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,640
you give him attention, it's just going to empower him.

1509
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,000
Nothing's going to stop him.

1510
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,600
Like he's always going to be doing this.

1511
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,840
So you might as well just fucking shit on him for

1512
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,480
the hell of it.

1513
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,240
You, you will not be able, I'm totally with you.

1514
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,800
You will not be able to stop people who wish to engage

1515
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,360
in drama.

1516
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,000
But here's what my, my argument would be that, but

1517
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,960
your time can be better used than wasting it on

1518
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,240
involving yourself with these people.

1519
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,760
That's, that's true.

1520
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,560
But like, you know, what are you going to be 100%

1521
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,840
optimized all the time?

1522
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,280
Are you going to be, are you going to be, are you

1523
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,520
going to use your time constructively 100%

1524
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,360
of the time, realistically?

1525
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,000
Using my patented formula of weird utilitarianism

1526
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
available at all CVSs for 1999, you can strive,

1527
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,560
you can strive to achieve getting as close to that

1528
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,320
goal as possible, which I think is what we should

1529
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,600
all try to do.

1530
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,440
That's my, you know, that's what I would want.

1531
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,040
Here's my, I, I, like.

1532
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,200
And certainly drama on this level is not something

1533
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,920
that I would want to like overindulge in, or even make

1534
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,840
like a regular, even make a regular part of my diet.

1535
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,560
Can the value of drama be from that, it, it gives

1536
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,200
your, it galvanizes your audience against something

1537
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,320
and that kind of gives them something to be invested

1538
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,960
in and enhance your personal narrative?

1539
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,280
I, I even think, I would even admit that there is,

1540
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,360
okay, but I would even admit that there is

1541
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,720
entertainment value to drama.

1542
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,560
I would say that it's limited and to keep everything,

1543
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,600
keep things in perspective.

1544
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,240
That's, that's all.

1545
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,920
I mean, you don't want it to be your character.

1546
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,400
I want to, I want to bring up this, this amazing

1547
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,760
Dick Masterson quote that, that a really like for me

1548
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,800
clinched like why drama is, is fine.

1549
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,520
And he was talking about how, because a huge part

1550
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,520
of the Dick show is him making fun of Maddox.

1551
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,160
It's a huge part of it's the drama he has with Maddox

1552
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,000
because of the fact that Maddox did all this shitty stuff

1553
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
to him and continues to do shitty stuff to him.

1554
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,800
And so Dick airs it all out immediately, partly

1555
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,200
to protect himself because it makes it easier

1556
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
for him to have all the cards if, you know,

1557
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,160
if the public is swayed to his side.

1558
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,840
But he also was talking about like the criticism

1559
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,840
he always gets like this show just relies on drama.

1560
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,000
And he said, I'm sorry that I provide serialized content

1561
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,520
with deep archetypal characters who, you know,

1562
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,000
who to tell you something about the world around you.

1563
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,560
And like, yeah, it's, it's just a show.

1564
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,440
Like what he's turned it into, he's taken real life

1565
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,240
and turned it into a TV show.

1566
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,640
And what we get out of a TV show is that it helps us

1567
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,880
to better understand the world, you know, like looking

1568
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,000
at Maddox and the particular ways that he fails

1569
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,480
is actually kind of helpful to like dealing

1570
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,320
with other people like Maddox.

1571
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,480
You know, like it makes me look at him and go like,

1572
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,520
oh, fuck, you know, now I get why that guy acts that way.

1573
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,520
Because he's just like fucking Maddox.

1574
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,120
The important distinction here, I think, is that Dick,

1575
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,280
Dick is his own person with his own character.

1576
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,800
He's not just defined by being the anti-Maddox guy.

1577
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,760
And like that, that makes it, that makes it like mean

1578
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,600
something that he has these opinions.

1579
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,080
Right.

1580
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,800
If you're, if you're like FNGR, oh, you're fucking,

1581
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,160
your whole thing is you're in there coming down on people

1582
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,640
left and right, nobody knows why, because what do you

1583
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,880
fucking stand for other than to shit on people?

1584
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,360
Like, you can't understand enough of what comes out

1585
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,560
of his mouth to figure out what his stance is.

1586
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,960
No, I mean, there's nothing, there's nothing

1587
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,120
that could save that particular content.

1588
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,000
That particular soul for being reaped

1589
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,520
by fucking Satan himself.

1590
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,520
His Kundalini is so wicked and fucking, you know,

1591
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,360
twisted up that you can't even straighten out

1592
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,720
even if you want to.

1593
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,080
The day of reckoning is coming.

1594
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,160
His Merkaba is artificial as fuck.

1595
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,600
And he's going, he's not going to go well for him.

1596
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,400
He was one of the original Martians that came to Earth

1597
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
and then, you know, integrated into the population,

1598
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,480
and he's just so greedy and power-driven that he needs to stop.

1599
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,080
FNGR is fully, fully left brain, fully mental.

1600
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:30,400
Indeed.

1601
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,120
At least a proto-masculine ideology will not

1602
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,480
survive the test to come.

1603
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,080
They will not endure.

1604
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,240
Is this spirit science shit you guys are about right now?

1605
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1606
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,360
Of course, of course.

1607
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,560
Okay, I got to ask, do you think that that's,

1608
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,840
is spirit science where the mind expansion meme came from?

1609
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,440
Because that imagery is in there all the fucking time.

1610
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,040
I was just like, I don't know, I don't know.

1611
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,280
Me and May got really baked and watched spirit science

1612
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,080
yesterday and that shit feels, dude, it feels so weird

1613
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,560
because it feels like, like a parody of an educational video

1614
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,680
that will be in a movie.

1615
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,400
It does, it does.

1616
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,760
I'm still not sold that it's not a fucking joke.

1617
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,600
I'm sure it's real.

1618
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,280
But like the comments, we weren't sure.

1619
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,560
We read this guy.

1620
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,720
This guy named like, it was, it was like Bobo the Bacon Lord

1621
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,760
or something like that.

1622
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,800
And he had this comment that I read and it was, it was,

1623
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,080
it was amazing and I just was stewing over like whether it

1624
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,120
was a troll comment or not.

1625
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,320
Like I couldn't tell.

1626
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,840
It was fascinating.

1627
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,400
I highly recommend going to watch spirit science

1628
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,320
and reading the comments because it's just,

1629
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,440
it's just getting lost.

1630
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
It's, it's again, it's like the genius thing where,

1631
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,040
where it's so out there.

1632
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,360
You can't believe it's real.

1633
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,680
But it, but it must be real.

1634
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,160
I learned, I did some research and I found something

1635
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,640
interesting.

1636
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,360
I'm going to share with you.

1637
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,680
It shed some light on spirit science because in that

1638
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,000
fucking history of humanity or whatever video,

1639
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,200
he talks about thought.

1640
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,520
He talks about like the, the Egyptian god thought,

1641
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,840
like reveals these things and that's how we know.

1642
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,920
And I was like, how are you talking to him?

1643
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,440
Like where is this source?

1644
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,840
And I looked it up and it turns out that in that video,

1645
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,960
he references a book and the book is by some guy.

1646
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
And in this book, this guy who wrote it,

1647
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,400
claims that he has like met this like ancient,

1648
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,760
like time traveling wizard who is like the Egyptian god.

1649
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,560
So basically all of this is based on one guy's book

1650
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,280
where he says that like a fucking time traveler visited

1651
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,960
him and told me this stuff.

1652
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,240
Dude, I didn't know that.

1653
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,720
I didn't know that.

1654
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
Yeah, that's what the whole thought thing is about.

1655
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,640
Anytime you can't, anytime you're sitting there

1656
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,400
watching spirit science debating yourself,

1657
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,280
whether it's real or not, just remember that every

1658
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,000
religion is real and they are all

1659
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,560
fucking weird as that.

1660
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,960
We just grew up hearing it, so it doesn't seem as weird.

1661
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,520
But if you told, if you described like the,

1662
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,160
the stories of the Old Testament to somebody

1663
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,840
who did not grow up with them, they're just gonna

1664
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,320
look you like, what in the fuck are you talking about?

1665
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,240
Like that is fucking insanity.

1666
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,840
I don't know if this constitutes as like drama,

1667
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,760
but me and Munchie, we're, we're watching the videos

1668
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,520
at one point, we were considering doing something

1669
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,280
similar to a ratty fucker's cop killer's

1670
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,040
like four spirit science.

1671
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,520
And I think it could be like the greatest idea of all time.

1672
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,120
I would like to do that in the somewhat near future,

1673
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,040
before the world ends, of course, and before we

1674
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,600
re-reach the end of the perception of the Equinox

1675
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,840
and we turn back into our spa and sleep phase.

1676
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,800
We have to use our third eye while it's still open,

1677
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,080
if you know what I mean.

1678
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,360
The world needs to see this shit.

1679
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,240
It's unbelievable.

1680
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,040
Okay, okay, well.

1681
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,440
We haven't been watched the human history movie

1682
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,200
in its entirety, by the way, and it was a

1683
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,640
transcendent experience.

1684
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,840
It shed a lot of light on a lot of things for me.

1685
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,200
Yeah, it really does a lot of clarify.

1686
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Let's get back to our topic with the drama.

1687
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,760
We've been sitting into the spirit science episode.

1688
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,600
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, there were a lot.

1689
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,560
Oh my god, we should have a praise consciousness episode.

1690
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,920
That's a great idea.

1691
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,360
I'm right there, Dan, right now.

1692
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,360
I'm just saying it really shed light on a lot

1693
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,360
of the mysteries that I had not understood,

1694
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,840
like the, like the energy networks permeating the earth.

1695
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,720
I'd always wondered.

1696
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,920
And that's why all those military bases are on this grid,

1697
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,200
on these tiny islands.

1698
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,440
On the nodes, they're on the spirit nodes, dude.

1699
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,360
It all makes sense.

1700
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,080
Let's get into maybe the negative effects of drama.

1701
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,920
Yeah, I want to start that off with saying that I, too,

1702
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,280
have had a Derek in my life.

1703
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,560
And eventually, he became like a joke to me.

1704
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,800
I would eventually just go to my friend's house,

1705
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,520
and whenever we would talk, we would just be like,

1706
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,120
hey, I wonder what this guy's doing.

1707
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,480
I bet he's fucking that kid, if you know what I mean.

1708
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:28,400
And so it would just turn into such like valuable entertainment.

1709
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,080
That would be better than watching a movie.

1710
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,480
It would just be us like thinking about what he's done

1711
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,240
and what kind of a person he is.

1712
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,360
And, you know, picking apart like the characterization of him

1713
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,920
and like, you know, writing fan fictions about himself

1714
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,960
in our brain.

1715
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,160
And that became our entertainment.

1716
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,640
And basically it was an entire, it was a great time.

1717
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,240
And the negative effects of drama is that it is inherently

1718
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,120
unsustainable.

1719
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,560
Like these people, the guy, it is an instigator.

1720
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,880
And he, you know, obviously when you're an instigator,

1721
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,160
you want to start drama.

1722
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,120
So when you start drama, and that's your entire deal,

1723
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,720
then eventually it's going to get to the point

1724
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,520
where the drama you make is going to be about you

1725
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,560
and you are going to be the drama that is removed.

1726
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,080
You are going to be like, like-

1727
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,720
I think that's kind of what has happened to Snob.

1728
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,560
Like no one pays attention to him anymore

1729
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,320
because all anybody knows about him is that he wants to start drama.

1730
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah, that's what I was saying before.

1731
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,720
Like drama can be fun and all, but if you become,

1732
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,560
if you become a drama person,

1733
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,280
then you become the one causing the drama.

1734
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,040
He did get literally booted from the platform.

1735
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,800
So that didn't help his visibility exactly.

1736
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,640
It's like, when you are trying to start shit with someone,

1737
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,600
that's exactly what we're doing.

1738
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,040
You're starting shit with someone.

1739
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,720
And after a while, they're just going to be like,

1740
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,480
okay, well, this isn't fucking worth it.

1741
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,760
And then they're going to cut you out.

1742
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,560
It isn't inherently like, once you go down that road,

1743
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,880
unless you fucking do it in absolute sincerity and beauty,

1744
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,000
you know, as depicted, the right-of-hook is cop killers,

1745
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,040
then you can easily tumble and fucking fall

1746
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,680
and eventually become the very, like when you want it,

1747
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,440
like say if you like don't like someone,

1748
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,440
when someone does and you start, you know,

1749
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,440
taking the piss out of them and do that constantly,

1750
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,040
then eventually you're going to be the one

1751
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,880
that people hate and want to take the piss out of

1752
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,560
and eliminate from society.

1753
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,680
If you indulge too much in drama and you love drama

1754
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,000
and like drama is a source of enjoyment for you

1755
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,600
and becomes like too much of that,

1756
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,560
then what eventually happens is you might run out

1757
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,600
of other drama and you will be like fucking hooked on it

1758
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,240
and you will feel the need to start it where none exists.

1759
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,640
You'll have to create, you'll have to create new drama

1760
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,360
so that there will be drama for like your life

1761
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,240
because you need it.

1762
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,600
If you develop that appetite, you will need to feed.

1763
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,640
Drama is best served as a side dish and not a main course.

1764
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
I gotta say though, like it's,

1765
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,320
the best is when drama just falls in your lap.

1766
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,760
That's when it's truly beautiful.

1767
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah, that's why I think it's an opportunity.

1768
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Exactly, it's just giving me permission.

1769
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,400
It's like life handing me a sledgehammer

1770
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
and then putting a watermelon in front of me

1771
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,320
and being like go ahead, dude.

1772
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,720
That's what it was with Forever World a few months ago

1773
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,520
where this, I just made a video about anime streaming

1774
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,120
and some idiot YouTuber just like decides to start drama

1775
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,920
for no reason.

1776
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,720
He's just like saying all this shit about me

1777
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,400
and like contacting my sponsors,

1778
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,120
like contacting Crunchyroll and being like how dare you break.

1779
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,040
Yeah, the reason I came at Forever World so hard

1780
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,640
is that he got on Twitter

1781
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,400
and was like at messaging Crunchyroll

1782
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,880
and Miles from Crunchyroll, like sending them my video

1783
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,600
and being like how dare you have this person at your convention

1784
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,760
when he's like anti, when he's anti legal streaming

1785
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,960
or whatever, which I'm not,

1786
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,120
and he completely misinterpreted the video.

1787
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,360
So for me, I was just like,

1788
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,680
oh, this is such a beautiful opportunity.

1789
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,320
You know, like this is such a-

1790
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,520
Forever World is a dummy who just misunderstood your point.

1791
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,920
I thought you're just like, no, never pay anything,

1792
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,360
even though you literally pay for whatever.

1793
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,240
It's not what you want.

1794
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,120
It's okay.

1795
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,120
It was just that feeling of seeing this guy

1796
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,880
who I've never really watched his content

1797
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,560
because I mean, it's terrible, you know,

1798
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,440
and it's like I have every reason to fight this dude

1799
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,680
because there's nothing I can gain from being friend.

1800
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,440
Like nobody likes him that I know.

1801
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,600
You know, there's no bridge that I'm worried about burning.

1802
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,240
So this guy just drops-

1803
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,360
This guy's number one fan right here,

1804
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,440
see my little on a seven on the plate real quick.

1805
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,320
You can engage with drama and it can be fine

1806
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,920
as long as your hands are clean.

1807
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,680
Like, but if you're the one stirring the pot,

1808
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,920
it's dangerous and people will come at you for it.

1809
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,560
The best part is that he has more subscribers than me.

1810
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,720
So it wasn't like I was punching down.

1811
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,120
It's like a guy-

1812
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,480
You could unshackle the beast.

1813
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,720
Oh, he handed me himself on a platter.

1814
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,880
And as soon as he did, I fucking railed him.

1815
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,200
And he actually like has continued to talk shit about me

1816
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,400
in like live streams and stuff,

1817
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,320
but he seems to be keeping it on the down low.

1818
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,520
Like, so like, for now, I'm just like, oh, whatever,

1819
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,680
you know, everybody know, like after I made my video,

1820
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,760
everybody told me like, yeah, everybody knows he's retarded.

1821
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,640
Like it's not a big deal.

1822
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,040
And I was like, okay, well, I'm not going to keep picking on him

1823
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,480
if nobody takes him seriously.

1824
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,560
But like, you know, but at the same time,

1825
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,720
it's like, just give me the push, dude.

1826
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,360
Just come back.

1827
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,360
You know, just come make another video about me.

1828
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,400
I'm ready, you know.

1829
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,240
Here's the thing that's frustrating me.

1830
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,400
And it's, this is semi drama related,

1831
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,280
but it's the idea of sort of the prodigal son.

1832
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,120
You know, the story of the prodigal son,

1833
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,120
who, you know, from the Bible and shit.

1834
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,960
So there was a father with two sons.

1835
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,640
He had one son that was a good old boy

1836
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,480
and just did his homework and did his chores

1837
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,320
and drank his milk and grew up being strong.

1838
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,120
The other son left home and was a big fuck up.

1839
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,440
And like the son who stayed around, like,

1840
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
like he just continued to do his job diligently.

1841
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,080
And the father, you know, I thought it was okay.

1842
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,200
But then the fuck up son comes home and like begs for help.

1843
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,600
Or he's just like, dad, oh, I fucked up, please help me.

1844
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,400
And like the Bible says, like canonically,

1845
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,240
the father loves the fuck up son way more

1846
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,720
than like the son who stayed around and was the good old boy.

1847
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,920
And this is evident in like every level of human interaction

1848
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,880
that like people love like redemption stories

1849
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,800
or like people getting saved from shit.

1850
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,680
So like, I feel like like drama is one of the ways

1851
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,440
that bad behavior is rewarded.

1852
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,040
And not just because like you start,

1853
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,720
like even if you like bad intentions

1854
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,480
are what get rewarded when people do this stuff.

1855
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,360
Like if you, like if someone starts drama

1856
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,480
and then gets called out because like,

1857
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,840
or someone doesn't commit a crime

1858
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,200
and then they are redeemed some way,

1859
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,040
that person will be more loved

1860
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,840
than the person who did nothing wrong the entire time.

1861
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,080
And like drama is very much related to this.

1862
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,000
And this is a little different,

1863
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,720
but like it's the idea of how many times have we seen

1864
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,200
people whose YouTube channels got deleted

1865
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,760
and then like a gigantic campaign starts

1866
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,040
every single time.

1867
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,960
I have ever seen someone's channel deleted

1868
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,960
for like not for like legitimate reasons.

1869
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,480
It comes back and surges in popularity every single,

1870
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,200
I want YouTube to delete my channel.

1871
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,280
YouTube, please delete best guy ever

1872
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,040
so I can do a fucking campaign

1873
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,640
and double my size instantly.

1874
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,760
It will happen.

1875
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,640
It will happen.

1876
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,640
I'll tell you that never, it never helped me.

1877
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,240
I've had my channel deleted twice.

1878
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,440
It never caused a surge,

1879
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,680
but I also never made a big fucking deal about it.

1880
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,960
Well, there's your issue right there.

1881
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,560
You got to make, you got to cry and scream.

1882
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,160
Right, just indignation.

1883
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,280
Exactly.

1884
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,560
Okay, but that is true.

1885
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,320
Maybe, maybe it doesn't double everybody's size

1886
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,240
all the time, but it never hurts

1887
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,520
as long as you actually get the channel back.

1888
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,160
I mean, yeah, that's, that's, that's been fun.

1889
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,880
It did probably increase my Patreon though,

1890
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,960
because like people just get worried about you, I guess.

1891
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,080
That's the most important, yeah, yeah.

1892
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,600
Start going money at you, which is interesting, you know?

1893
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,760
So that's the concept I'm talking about here.

1894
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,280
It's like this, when you're filled

1895
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,280
with the righteous indignation here.

1896
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,960
Yeah, and I'm not, like, obviously.

1897
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,120
That is why the Dick Show is so successful.

1898
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,520
Like, the Dick Show, the Dick Show is already

1899
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,360
a successful podcast.

1900
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:27,680
It probably had like seven grand before

1901
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,200
Maddox made his big Dick Lies video

1902
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,720
and a couple weeks, like a month later,

1903
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,000
it had like 20 grand.

1904
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,360
You know, like people were,

1905
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,320
it was the anger people had towards Maddox

1906
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:44,000
that spurned them to raise their donations to Dick.

1907
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And the fact that Dick capitalized on it so well

1908
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,240
by making it such a good story, you know?

1909
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,120
Whereas Maddox was being silent, like a fucking idiot.

1910
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,120
And Maddox is effective at like,

1911
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,640
Maddox is effective at like, since he is famous,

1912
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,720
he's good at like giving other people stuff.

1913
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,200
By attacking them, he gives them, you know,

1914
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,800
like Dick achieves success in this way

1915
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,400
through Maddox fucking with them.

1916
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,640
And like, but he can't do it for himself

1917
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,680
is the point I'm trying to get to.

1918
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,600
He like, it's, I don't know, what the fuck is he doing?

1919
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,760
It's because he's a fucking idiot, that's why.

1920
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,320
Anyway.

1921
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,080
Well, the man did literally invent the internet,

1922
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,320
so credit for that.

1923
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,240
I wanted to talk about the negative effects of drama.

1924
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,520
The main ones that I've felt, mostly that

1925
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,400
whether or not the person you have drama with

1926
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,840
takes it seriously, some of their fans will take it very seriously.

1927
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,320
And they will come, like, there was a few,

1928
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,160
like the people who were the most mad at me

1929
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,560
when I made my shit talking anime YouTubers video

1930
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,760
were not anybody who I talked shit about in the video.

1931
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,440
It was other auxiliary people who thought,

1932
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,160
like who were just upset that I had done that.

1933
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,080
The worst, I'm just gonna call them out.

1934
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,520
Let's start drama right now.

1935
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,200
Oh, there we go.

1936
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,880
It would not be a drama cast without it.

1937
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,360
All right.

1938
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,160
The worst of them all is Nolan B from the pizza party podcast.

1939
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,880
Oh my god.

1940
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,160
Because that guy had invited me onto the podcast,

1941
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,360
he was a big fan of me, he invited me onto the pizza party.

1942
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,080
I just have to mention that pan pizza is a meme,

1943
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,320
like that I hate him so much that he is a meme

1944
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,640
in my own circle of friends, so I'm very excited to hear.

1945
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,200
Apparently my friend Blind Skywatcher,

1946
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,080
like obsessively watches his videos as a meme,

1947
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,160
like because he's like deeply fascinated.

1948
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1949
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,040
But yeah, so the pizza party podcast

1950
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,720
was a very popular podcast, apparently.

1951
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,040
I was invited on by Nolan B,

1952
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,960
nobody else in the podcast really knew who I was.

1953
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,320
It was kind of a mediocre show.

1954
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,480
I didn't really enjoy doing it.

1955
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,800
They edit the shit out of that podcast,

1956
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,280
like they cut out all the silences and they speed it up,

1957
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,560
so it sounds way better than it actually is to record.

1958
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,320
But after that, he kept trying to stay in contact with me,

1959
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,560
but I never really responded because I didn't really know the guy

1960
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,640
and a lot of the stuff he would ask me is stuff you could

1961
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,240
just find out by watching my videos.

1962
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,000
So I kind of kept him at arm's length.

1963
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,240
After I made the shit talking anime YouTuber's video,

1964
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,080
that dude writes this huge screen about what a piece of shit I am

1965
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
for doing that and just all this stuff

1966
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,040
about how I'm like a monster on his Tumblr

1967
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,400
and released it publicly and was just shitting on me

1968
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,520
on Twitter and stuff, all this out of nowhere

1969
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,760
because he was mad on other people's behalf.

1970
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,680
Nobody who was insulted in the video was even angry about it.

1971
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,440
But this dude goes fucking ham and I was just like,

1972
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,240
this is like, this is the, on the one hand,

1973
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,080
this is a negative effect of starting drama,

1974
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,320
is that you got to deal with people like this.

1975
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,040
On the other hand, you also get the fun of,

1976
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,440
you know, like showing all your friends this guy

1977
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,280
and going like, look at this fucking idiot, you know,

1978
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,840
which is very gratifying in itself.

1979
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,400
I think we've all done that at least.

1980
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:50,160
Like whether we start open drama, when people come at you,

1981
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,120
it's so satisfying to show your friends and point and laugh at them.

1982
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Oh, definitely. That guy, by the way, on that guy,

1983
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,600
I forget how I found his Twitter,

1984
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,560
but apparently he's like still going hard on like the PCP itself

1985
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,520
is horrible and we're all bunch of crazy losers.

1986
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,360
Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

1987
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,720
Can we start some, can we start?

1988
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,000
Let's start some fucking drama.

1989
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,720
Do we have a P?

1990
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,360
Hey, Peter Party podcast is a bigger podcast than us.

1991
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,040
In PCP versus PPP.

1992
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,280
PCP versus PPP, dude.

1993
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:19,840
We've got it.

1994
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,800
It's that C versus P. It's that C in that P.

1995
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1996
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,040
Oh, god.

1997
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,600
C, P.

1998
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,480
Fuck.

1999
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:26,800
Can we, can we?

2000
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,360
Oh, no.

2001
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,240
We need to do a few, we need to do a few months of research

2002
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,400
to categorize the actual accusations made.

2003
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:32,800
Yeah.

2004
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,880
Before, before I jump into that, I will say we do have,

2005
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,520
Prepare a legal case.

2006
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,680
We do have shared audience with them.

2007
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,640
I know that.

2008
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,440
I know that there are people who like both our podcasts and theirs,

2009
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,760
which means it's even a better reason to start drama.

2010
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,800
Oh, my god.

2011
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,520
I have an idea.

2012
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,240
Oh, my god.

2013
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,920
Do you think they'll go?

2014
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,960
Do you think they would bite if we deliberately started drama?

2015
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,520
You've already got one guy who hates drama.

2016
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,240
Maybe I'll listen.

2017
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,760
Maybe I'll go listen to some just as he,

2018
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,160
because I may not listen to them.

2019
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,840
I have to have legitimate grievances,

2020
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,400
but the fact that they should talk you is,

2021
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,720
that's like the first bullet in my clip already.

2022
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,840
That's a good springboard.

2023
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,200
I don't remember if he took down that Tumblr post,

2024
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,680
but like, if I could find it, if you guys read that thing,

2025
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,280
you'd be like, oh, god.

2026
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,960
I remember reading this at the time.

2027
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2028
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,200
But I want to know where he,

2029
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,520
I'm curious about what he said about the PCP in specific.

2030
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,680
Yeah, because that doesn't have some skin in the game now.

2031
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,600
It's just some offhand comments like the PCP.

2032
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,000
He has the same air that Vita did in that first Miss Anthropony Vita.

2033
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,480
Like, oh, Munchie, I don't watch that channel.

2034
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,760
I have standards.

2035
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,560
Well, I mean, hey, that's cool and all, guys,

2036
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,280
but the PCP doesn't feel the need to heavily edit

2037
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,520
and speed up its audio in order to be into it.

2038
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,720
Yeah, just saying.

2039
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,360
Yeah!

2040
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,080
I'm about over here.

2041
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,040
Just fucking saying.

2042
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,720
By the way, I do have an old grievance

2043
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:54,160
with Rebel Taxi in that he's one of the legions of people

2044
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,840
who made disgusting and unworthy Gern Lagen reviews

2045
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,840
that I had to correct on my channel.

2046
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,680
So you're welcome for that Rebel Taxi.

2047
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,280
Your scene has been washed away.

2048
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,240
Let's do it.

2049
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,760
The funniest thing about this,

2050
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,000
if we did start a drama with them deliberately,

2051
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,440
is that our entire audience would know we were doing it

2052
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,920
just to fuck with them and troll and start drama.

2053
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,560
That's true.

2054
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,800
Like, everyone in our audience knows what we're doing,

2055
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,520
but it would be so funny.

2056
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,960
I'm so happy that this character arc that has been like,

2057
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,200
this storyline that has started within my group of friends

2058
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,720
is becoming a real thing,

2059
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,520
not a joke that is actually transpiring in real life now.

2060
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,840
Oh, how fortuitous.

2061
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
I know, it's terrible.

2062
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,360
Well, is there anything else to say on the subject?

2063
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,560
Or should we move on to questions?

2064
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,000
I think we'll run the...

2065
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,440
I mean, I don't know.

2066
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,000
Drama is good unless it isn't, most of the time it isn't,

2067
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,680
but sometimes, mwah.

2068
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,840
Oh, I wasn't...

2069
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,200
It's a great spice on top of your normal content.

2070
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,760
Yeah, there was one more negative consequence of drama

2071
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,560
I wanted to bring up,

2072
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,880
which is just that because I personally have started

2073
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,880
so much drama, it seems like a lot of smaller creators

2074
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,160
are afraid of me.

2075
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,600
A lot of people seem tepid about approaching me.

2076
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,080
I don't know if that's more because I'm popular

2077
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,440
or if it's because of the drama.

2078
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,080
I think I may have seen that a little bit.

2079
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:16,880
But it seems like both.

2080
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,440
Maybe.

2081
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:23,040
I've definitely had people seem like they're afraid to approach me

2082
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,840
and when they want to ask me for something,

2083
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,720
for a project, it's always like they'll do it

2084
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,040
through somebody else I know or try to work their way in.

2085
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,160
And I'm like, dude, I've talked to my fans in the comment sections.

2086
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,200
I'm not hard to reach.

2087
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

2088
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,280
I mean, so people should have a normal amount of trepidation

2089
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,360
about trying to show something to someone

2090
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,880
who you might be wasting their time.

2091
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,840
Not even that.

2092
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,800
Like, for instance, I mean, there's the big anti-tuber chat room

2093
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,760
that I was initially not added to.

2094
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,800
Jeff claims that's because he forgot to send me the message.

2095
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,760
Oh, fucking yeah.

2096
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,320
But I had heard that there was some trepidation

2097
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,240
about whether I should be invited

2098
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,320
because I might hate everyone in there

2099
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,800
and start a bunch of shit, which is like,

2100
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,800
it's just a mischaracterization of like,

2101
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,400
yes, I get into drama, but it's usually because we've reached.

2102
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,680
We've reached for a specific reason that hasn't been laid

2103
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,640
over the course of millennia.

2104
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,800
We've reached the end of a rope, and it has to,

2105
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,000
something has to give.

2106
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,080
And I'm not willing to stay quiet forever the way

2107
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,440
a lot of people are, you know?

2108
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,400
But I'm not like, it's not like if you start talking to me,

2109
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,360
I'm going to flip shit on you and make a video about you

2110
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,720
immediately, you know?

2111
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,760
Just because you like said hi.

2112
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,960
I think that was, yeah.

2113
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,520
I get a lot too, weirdly enough.

2114
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,080
A lot of fans that always be like, you know, Munchie,

2115
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,160
like, I'm really sorry, please don't kill me.

2116
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,040
I don't want to die.

2117
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,280
Please, and of course I kill them instantly.

2118
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,000
Of course I don't allow them the time to prove themselves.

2119
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Whereas if they had faced me unblinking

2120
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,240
with the sheer terror they could on their face,

2121
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,440
then I might have spared them.

2122
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,080
I could sense that Kundalini was severed,

2123
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,960
and I needed to fucking chop it into a million pieces.

2124
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,160
Exactly.

2125
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,160
Currently in one piece, Big Mom has this power where,

2126
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,280
actually, you know what, I won't spoil it,

2127
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,400
never mind, forget it.

2128
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,280
Excellent.

2129
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,440
It was relevant, but I'm not going to spoil it.

2130
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,120
Life is just a big game of Beyblade,

2131
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,360
and everyone's Merkabah is their Beyblade,

2132
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,840
and you just have to crash your Merkabahs into each other,

2133
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,960
and whichever one breaks is the loser and die.

2134
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,560
That's just a game, and you're a new.

2135
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,160
I don't feel the need, I guess, to go into it in detail,

2136
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,760
but I personally choose, in general, to live my life

2137
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
like just talking about ideas.

2138
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,920
I know I say this a million times,

2139
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,280
just whatever, like Elna Roosevelt,

2140
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,280
like big people talk about ideas,

2141
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,120
whatever, small people talk about people.

2142
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,800
Whatever the fucking quote is, you know the one thing.

2143
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,240
And I try to do everything by that,

2144
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,440
and I just think it makes the most sense.

2145
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,680
And Best Guy Ever talks about Star Trek.

2146
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,560
Hey, Star Trek's not bad, you could do worse.

2147
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,360
You could do worse.

2148
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,280
Especially Star Trek Discovery on Sundays at 7 p.m. on NBC.

2149
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,840
To me.

2150
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,560
No, I'm just kidding, I don't know.

2151
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,920
Drama is just like, treat it as if you're watching

2152
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,440
like a funny YouTube video,

2153
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,600
and expend that exact amount of time on it,

2154
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,680
a.k.a. like, you know, not that long per day, if at all.

2155
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,640
And just use it as a funny entertainment.

2156
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,080
Every once in a blue moon.

2157
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,160
Yep.

2158
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,120
Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

2159
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,360
That's good, good, good.

2160
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,360
And when your friends wrong you in any way,

2161
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,640
please go to your other friends

2162
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,320
and shit talk about them constantly.

2163
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,800
Preferably while hot boxing, vape in a car.

2164
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,640
That, there you go.

2165
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,440
That's my strategy.

2166
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,320
That's the news from the street, from Munchiewares.

2167
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,200
Tiny hats, I feel like I'm gonna regret

2168
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,080
that I potentially just started more drama with Nolan B.

2169
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,240
Like, I already regret having said anything.

2170
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,080
What have I done?

2171
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh God, what have I done?

2172
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
His podcast is gay and so is he.

2173
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,200
Okay, he's done.

2174
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,200
We need to start a PCP drama

2175
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,800
when you told us to take it out,

2176
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,920
but we didn't cut it out.

2177
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,040
Now you're mad at all of us,

2178
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,280
and we begin, the destruction begins.

2179
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,280
Who's the Maddox of the PCP?

2180
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:58,960
Davoo.

2181
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,240
Yeah.

2182
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,440
Oh, he will be very insulted to hear that.

2183
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,480
But anyway, thanks.

2184
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,480
All right, let's do some questions

2185
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,000
while we're doing this motherfucker.

2186
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,080
Let's do it, everybody.

2187
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,840
Okay, how about, this isn't a question,

2188
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,400
at Janiz Makudobaru, when is they progress?

2189
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,520
Maybe there's a bingo board.

2190
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,640
I'm finding that him and all of his fans

2191
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,120
seem to shit talk us pretty regularly, so.

2192
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:23,680
Well, all right.

2193
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,840
Okay, we'll look into this.

2194
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,360
We'll look into it like we'll update you.

2195
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,480
We'll really know next episode what's about to inspire.

2196
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
I'm for real gonna fucking look into this,

2197
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
and if there's fucking shit being slung,

2198
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,720
I'm gonna have something to say about it.

2199
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,480
Whether or not he's slinging shit,

2200
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,080
there definitely seems to be a sentiment

2201
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,880
among people who follow him that is very anti-PCP.

2202
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,720
Okay, okay.

2203
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,760
Oh my god.

2204
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,120
What was Janiz Makudobaru?

2205
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,640
This is gonna be our first Moby Dick.

2206
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,840
This is gonna be the whale that we have

2207
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,520
to fucking spear through the heart.

2208
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,480
This is gonna be our fucking,

2209
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,760
we're gonna have our wiggling day

2210
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,080
where we have to fucking face the seven trials

2211
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,480
and come out as baby trolls.

2212
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,200
We've been assembling this motley crew

2213
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,280
for just such a promised day.

2214
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,480
For the record, the opinions of some PCP members

2215
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,080
do not reflect the opinions of others.

2216
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,640
Anybody who does not want to be involved in this drama

2217
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,840
is not involved in this drama.

2218
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,000
Do not throw everybody under the bus of the PCP

2219
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,120
just because me and Ben and Munchy happen to be.

2220
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,440
This has nothing to do with anybody

2221
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,960
who's not on this episode.

2222
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,280
None of them give a fuck about Nolan B

2223
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,360
or the Pizza Party podcast, I'm sure.

2224
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,080
Unless they at least not yet.

2225
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,040
Yeah, at least not yet.

2226
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,160
They will, they will.

2227
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,400
The only reason I'm so enthusiastic

2228
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,680
is because whenever I see a pan pizza video thumbnail,

2229
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,240
I just laugh so hard that I cry.

2230
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,720
I gotta check this out.

2231
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,520
Okay, whatever.

2232
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,240
All right, listen.

2233
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,880
Listen, this is bullshit.

2234
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,680
I'm just seriously interested.

2235
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,120
Okay, good.

2236
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:49,600
Update us.

2237
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,960
Here's the thing.

2238
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,440
At Janny's Muckin' Tomorrow asks,

2239
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,800
or doesn't ask, but says,

2240
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,840
when does a procrastinator's bingo board getting made

2241
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,880
get on it, fans?

2242
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,160
And I actually think that'd be a great idea

2243
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,280
when listening to the PCP.

2244
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,400
I'm surprised we haven't done that yet.

2245
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,760
That should be a real thing.

2246
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,040
I think maybe because we have a rotating cast,

2247
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,560
maybe every individual member

2248
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,840
would need their own bingo board.

2249
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,120
Oh, that's a bad idea.

2250
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,800
Because if it was something like

2251
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,000
Nate's Weird Utilitarian,

2252
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,800
well, I mean, that doesn't count

2253
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,840
because you're on every episode.

2254
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,880
But if it's something like...

2255
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,840
I don't have to be though.

2256
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,960
But if it's something like, you know,

2257
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,440
Tom Bowman leaves your writing in the first place.

2258
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,520
Every time Ben vapes or fucks up Eddie.

2259
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,080
Yeah, yeah.

2260
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,560
I made a drinking game with that already.

2261
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,240
Yeah, we already did the drinking game

2262
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,160
with all these things you guys are freaking up.

2263
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,440
That's true.

2264
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,440
That seems more our speed than a bingo board

2265
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,560
to be honest.

2266
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,360
Oh, okay.

2267
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:35,760
Well, whatever.

2268
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,320
Bingo board.

2269
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,840
Well, some fan wants to make a bingo board.

2270
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,400
Please do.

2271
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:38,880
Yeah, please.

2272
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,600
This is interesting.

2273
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,360
If you want to do all the heavy lifting for us

2274
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,440
because we're just too busy

2275
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,360
with all this amazing content.

2276
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,360
We'll retweet it so everyone could use it.

2277
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,440
For sure.

2278
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,880
From the procrastinator's Patreon lounge,

2279
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,120
don't enter our Patreon for just one measly

2280
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,360
miniscule of a dollar.

2281
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,120
And you'll get in and we'll fuck you.

2282
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:57,360
Yeah.

2283
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,480
Remewersalists.

2284
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,080
And if you're in the Discord,

2285
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,920
you're much more likely to have your questions

2286
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:02,720
right on the show.

2287
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,680
Exactly.

2288
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,320
A question from-

2289
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,640
No, I want to say by Garbage Burner,

2290
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,720
who's the worst pair of you on the podcast?

2291
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,400
Like who of us?

2292
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,680
You know, there's these social social media

2293
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,920
podcasts, The Right Focus Cop Killers and all of that.

2294
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,240
Who would be the worst two people to have

2295
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,760
on a podcast at any given time?

2296
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,280
I think me and Davoo,

2297
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,720
even though I really like Davoo,

2298
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,640
I remember you and Davoo did not gel at all

2299
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,160
on the first Rowdy fuckers.

2300
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,800
Yeah.

2301
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,400
Davoo did not know what to make of you.

2302
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,040
We gel kind of real in real life,

2303
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,000
like a little bit.

2304
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,680
I mean, it was more like we have a lot to say

2305
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,760
about Mario and Luigi, but other than that.

2306
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,320
Yeah.

2307
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,760
And when I'm trying to fucking sleep

2308
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,600
at like 3 a.m. in the goddamn morning,

2309
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,000
you worthless creatures.

2310
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,840
I think, I'm going to say me and Jesse,

2311
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,400
because we do not see eye to eye on anything.

2312
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,240
And even like as far back as the show has gone,

2313
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,840
there have been things that Jesse has said

2314
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,880
that I have tried to argue.

2315
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,560
Like I remember we're talking about like

2316
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,000
attitudes towards fans and stuff

2317
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,920
and like attitudes towards criticism.

2318
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,640
And I have, it has made me so mad before.

2319
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,040
And I have, and it just does not,

2320
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,240
it's not, but not in a good way.

2321
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,880
You know, a lot of us approach things differently.

2322
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,080
The problem with this question is that

2323
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,640
it depends on what the podcast is about.

2324
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,480
Like, I think, that is true.

2325
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,680
Just in general.

2326
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,320
I think if Ben and Jesse were doing a podcast

2327
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,480
about like a specific game they both liked,

2328
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,960
they would have an incredibly in-depth conversation

2329
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,400
and both notice a bunch of shit

2330
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,000
that the rest of us wouldn't.

2331
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,880
Because you're both like very attentive viewers.

2332
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,160
I think if Davoo and Munchy had a conversation

2333
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,160
about like weird art.

2334
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,040
Like weird, like deep web art.

2335
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,960
It would be a fascinating podcast.

2336
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,720
So like any combination of us,

2337
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,400
it's just a matter of finding the thing

2338
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,960
that the two of us can discuss, you know?

2339
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,160
I agree, I agree.

2340
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,560
I asked Davoo to which he replied,

2341
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,640
ha ha, if you wanted to do an arm retrieval

2342
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,240
about the Kirby anime.

2343
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,960
And I think that would be hilarious.

2344
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,320
That sounds like a good plan.

2345
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,040
Yeah.

2346
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,000
Hey, listen to this question.

2347
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,200
Me and Davoo were gonna do,

2348
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,480
like when we were in Atlanta,

2349
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,080
we were walking around and Davoo was saying

2350
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,080
that we should do like a two-person show

2351
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,840
about like weird art.

2352
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,040
And I was into it at the time,

2353
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,400
but it never got brought up again.

2354
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,040
What a shame.

2355
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:12,880
There's still time.

2356
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,840
There's still time.

2357
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,280
Hey, let's do this question here.

2358
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,840
At Mozu Disposition asks,

2359
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,960
is Reverse Bukake pro-feminist?

2360
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,720
Now first of all, first of all,

2361
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,560
can someone explain to me what the fuck Reverse is?

2362
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,160
Yeah, yeah, that's what it asks.

2363
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,200
Secreting?

2364
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,760
No, no, no, this is a girl stuffing

2365
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,840
the cum on her body back into your dick.

2366
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,280
I assume it's a girl squirting on a guy.

2367
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,160
Okay, I checked it out

2368
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,080
and I went to my friend Urban Dictionary

2369
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,080
and he told me that Reverse Bukake

2370
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,400
is the actor of one man being ejaculated

2371
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,760
on by a group of girls.

2372
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,400
So there you go.

2373
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,920
Is that pro-feminist?

2374
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,360
I'm gonna say it's like it.

2375
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:49,680
No, no.

2376
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:49,760
No?

2377
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,400
No?

2378
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:50,800
Why?

2379
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,920
It's still a cuss.

2380
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,080
Because it's still meant for a guy to jack off to.

2381
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,440
This is a really hard question.

2382
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,200
Let's move on to another one.

2383
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,480
This is bullshit.

2384
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,760
You're scared of...

2385
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,960
You fear women's power.

2386
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,480
That's why you want to get away from this question.

2387
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,040
Of course I do.

2388
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,440
Of course.

2389
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,320
Student of Ethereum

2390
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,320
who always asks like a thousand questions

2391
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,040
on every episode,

2392
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,120
but they're usually all right ones in there.

2393
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,720
Favorite internet content creator

2394
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,560
who isn't making content anymore?

2395
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,960
Mr. Beton.

2396
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,560
I was just gonna say Mr. Beton.

2397
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,040
Mr. Beton.

2398
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:19,840
Yeah, yeah.

2399
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,120
Oh, I would say Christian Weston Chandler,

2400
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:23,920
but he's back.

2401
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,760
But his new stuff is sucks and is boring.

2402
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,160
So as far as I'm concerned, Christian is dead.

2403
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,040
What's he making now?

2404
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,360
What's he doing?

2405
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,600
He's still making comics, but they're stupid.

2406
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,120
Like they're just like him,

2407
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,920
him like sending a positive message about trans rights.

2408
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,320
Snore.

2409
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,080
Agreed.

2410
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,480
Agreed.

2411
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,360
Fucking Jan Rankowski or Parker91.

2412
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,440
I'm fine with Parker91 over.

2413
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,400
I'm fine with that.

2414
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,680
Chapter might have been closed.

2415
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,000
But his new channel, Wisdom Gun,

2416
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,120
is fucking gone dude.

2417
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,760
Like some sort of like drama that I don't fully understand.

2418
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,800
I need to research this.

2419
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,240
I'm so fucking upset.

2420
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,760
Jan, please come back.

2421
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,360
I love you with all my heart.

2422
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:02,240
I love DIY high guy where you play the role of a CIA agent

2423
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,320
trying to test out various different drugs.

2424
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,560
I want that series back in my life.

2425
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,560
DIY high guy.

2426
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:08,960
Yeah.

2427
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:09,680
That sounds good.

2428
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,880
That sounds good.

2429
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,560
Oh, did Shalegett like delete it?

2430
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,840
Or was it to take it down for some reason?

2431
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,400
No, no, no.

2432
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,680
It's just like he's just not.

2433
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,000
Okay.

2434
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,400
He's just not there anymore for like some unfortunate reason.

2435
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,000
Maybe he tried every drug

2436
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,920
and there was nothing left to do.

2437
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:24,720
Let's hope so.

2438
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,520
I want to ask a two part question.

2439
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,760
Mostly because the question itself is fascinating.

2440
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,280
More so than whatever answer we could give.

2441
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,240
It's from SquidMiku who asks,

2442
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Have you ever had a food phase?

2443
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,160
For example, I ate nothing but SpaghettiOs for one year.

2444
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,280
Also, what's something weird you like to eat?

2445
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,320
For example, for me, it's yogurt sandwiches.

2446
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,920
Oh my fucking god.

2447
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,760
SquidMiku, you have a problem.

2448
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,600
And it doesn't just stop at this question.

2449
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,120
I got really into tea for a while there.

2450
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,120
I was drinking a lot of weird teas.

2451
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,960
I'm currently in my tea phase.

2452
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,480
I'm surrounded right now by pure leaf unsweetened black tea bottles

2453
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,360
just surrounding my complete naked facade right now.

2454
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,040
Whatever you guys say tea

2455
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,360
and then tell me that it's like store bought bottled tea,

2456
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,720
I just throw up a little by now.

2457
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,800
No, I'm talking about stuff that I got from like an herb shop

2458
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,200
that I like to eat.

2459
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:17,600
Good.

2460
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,080
Good.

2461
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:18,880
That's the good shit.

2462
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,720
Yeah, I got some like fancy white tea

2463
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,200
and was like way into like learning the exact temperature

2464
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,480
it'll to brew it at and stuff.

2465
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:24,560
Oh my god.

2466
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,120
It was fun.

2467
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,040
But I don't do it anymore because it's a hassle.

2468
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:27,840
I didn't know that was an aspect that could.

2469
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,360
And the reward is not worth it.

2470
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,200
I didn't know that Beyblade customization

2471
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,560
was the thing that you could do with tea

2472
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,120
though I realized it's now obvious in retrospect.

2473
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,000
I'm going to do that now.

2474
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,120
It's going to be a new thing that I do.

2475
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,560
Okay, I actually did.

2476
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,800
For sophomore year of college,

2477
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,480
I survived mostly on gigantic boxes of goldfish.

2478
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,520
Gigantic boxes.

2479
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,720
I mean bring them up to my roof.

2480
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,680
I would not leave.

2481
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:53,120
That's as bad as eating nothing but spaghetti for a year.

2482
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,240
Yeah, it was terrible.

2483
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,040
It was terrible.

2484
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,240
I think that may be even worse.

2485
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,440
And by the way, by the way much,

2486
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,160
and literally I lived above the mess hall.

2487
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,000
All I had to do was walk downstairs to free food all day

2488
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,640
and eat it.

2489
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,440
But I chose to stay in my room, play video games,

2490
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,680
and eat fucking goldfish exclusively.

2491
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,200
There was light.

2492
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,160
I'm a monster.

2493
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,720
It was a year after that I started working out and eating more.

2494
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,920
So that was probably why.

2495
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,840
When I first got in sixth grade,

2496
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
which by the way my sixth grade year,

2497
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,080
I started off the year like the last day of summer,

2498
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,240
I watched the human history movies for the first time.

2499
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,600
I believe that was the year at least.

2500
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,400
Anyway, great year to start off.

2501
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,320
For like the entire first half of the year,

2502
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,840
like six months,

2503
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,480
I ate nothing but bags of croutons.

2504
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,320
Whoa, weird.

2505
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,360
Like would you get them?

2506
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,240
Where'd you get them?

2507
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,920
I just went to Bons.

2508
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,840
I went to Bons and I just had packets of croutons.

2509
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,040
How did you live off of this?

2510
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,440
Just croutons and goldfish in both of your cases.

2511
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,040
Yeah, just carbs.

2512
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:49,840
Simple carbs.

2513
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,560
Yeah, that's it.

2514
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,360
It's all you need, dude.

2515
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,680
Don't you need like protein or something?

2516
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,400
No.

2517
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,680
Digi, look at me.

2518
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,720
Look at me, Digi.

2519
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,280
You think I need anything that's not carbs?

2520
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,720
No, no, never.

2521
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,960
Mochi's body consumes its own waste products

2522
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,760
and recycles it.

2523
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,040
I start to like,

2524
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:09,120
I start to feel sick if I eat the same dish like twice in a day.

2525
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,080
Like I feel gross and I need to go eat another thing.

2526
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,120
You just got to delicate stuff there, Digi.

2527
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,760
You got to hard the fuck up with the bombs dropped by Digi.

2528
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,920
When World War III stops,

2529
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,520
I'm only going to have packets of croutons

2530
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,560
that's all I'm going to be able to assist off of.

2531
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,480
Yeah, I'm only going to have fucking goldfish just to survive.

2532
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,120
This is crazy.

2533
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,680
Digi's just been spoiled by all that sweet Patreon money.

2534
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:30,080
He can afford to buy something new all the time.

2535
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,720
I can afford to buy a place in a day.

2536
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:37,840
I'm a relatively picky eater, but like I won't, I don't know.

2537
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,120
Like it has to be like a different,

2538
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,120
like the other day I had a garbage plate

2539
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,880
for that video I did about garbage plates

2540
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,040
and like I ate until I was full

2541
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,880
and then later I tried to eat more

2542
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,560
and like even though it was delicious,

2543
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,600
my stomach was like,

2544
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,160
you need another kind of nutrient than this.

2545
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,400
Like you can't keep eating this

2546
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,440
because this will kill you.

2547
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,920
Right.

2548
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,960
You know, so go eat a different thing.

2549
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,440
He has an acute case of rich person syndrome.

2550
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,240
I guess so.

2551
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,040
Well, maybe your body is like more attuned

2552
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,800
to what it actually needs or something.

2553
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,440
I don't know, people, it's bad that my body

2554
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,040
like doesn't immediately punish me

2555
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,360
for just eating goldfish for a fucking year.

2556
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,520
I do have a habit where like if I like take some shitty food,

2557
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,960
like I'll eat a ton of shitty food

2558
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,120
and I'll eat it and I'll be full and disgusting

2559
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,880
and I'll be like, oh God, that was so bad.

2560
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,400
Like I'm so full of crap.

2561
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,160
And then I'll be like, oh, I'm so full, I'm gonna die.

2562
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,280
But then I'll be like, wait,

2563
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,520
and I'll go and I'll eat an apple afterwards

2564
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,960
and like think that it'll make me less full than no.

2565
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,160
It just makes you more full.

2566
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,400
It doesn't actually work to make you feel better.

2567
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,160
I would say I've never been through a food phase

2568
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,000
like what you guys are describing,

2569
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,800
but like I've been through lots of like just,

2570
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,520
what's the word for like all the foods you eat?

2571
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,120
Like your diet, I guess?

2572
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,880
Yeah, your diet, sure, sure.

2573
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,000
I've been through like diet phases,

2574
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,400
not like doing a diet, but like where every,

2575
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,120
like I'm eating the same seven or eight things

2576
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,040
and then it cycles into a different seven

2577
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,480
or eight things at some point.

2578
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,640
You know, so like it might,

2579
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,560
and I'll have phases where like I got really

2580
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,840
into spicy food for a while,

2581
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,600
I was trying to eat like spicy shit all the time,

2582
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,560
just like boost up my ability to eat spicy foods,

2583
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,040
or I got like way into onions for a while,

2584
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,240
but it was never to an extent

2585
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,960
like just eating onions all the time.

2586
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,080
It was just like, oh, maybe I'll get onions on my burger

2587
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,360
every time I get a burger.

2588
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,160
I did, when I was in California

2589
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,840
and I was super poor and living for free

2590
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,680
and some guys in my friend's side room,

2591
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,120
I did have a phase of like,

2592
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,880
I used to just eat tons of egg sandwiches

2593
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,960
because eggs are really cheap and bread is really cheap.

2594
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,040
I had a just, I would just fry eggs and put them on bread.

2595
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,880
See, like I had a phase,

2596
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,240
I had a phase of being way into egg salad sandwiches,

2597
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,600
but I wouldn't say it was something I was eating all the time, you know.

2598
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,000
I love egg salad, by the way.

2599
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,840
Like I did have a phase where I would make myself

2600
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,480
an egg salad sandwich probably every other day,

2601
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,480
you know, for lunch, but it's not like all of us eating, you know.

2602
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,040
Side note here, how awful is it

2603
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,520
that we've let anime gone the better of us?

2604
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,920
I mean, it didn't do a spicy bro pack to anime expo,

2605
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,560
named Digi.

2606
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,360
How fucking abysmal is that?

2607
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,800
It was, we tried, but we had like some game with it.

2608
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,840
What do you mean we tried, dude?

2609
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,560
I was there too.

2610
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,960
I said Nate.

2611
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,600
Oh, you did?

2612
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
Oh, okay, okay.

2613
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,240
It's a shame, that needs to be,

2614
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,840
Rycon 3 coming up real soon.

2615
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,200
Part two of that question though,

2616
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,840
did any of you have a weird thing you like to eat?

2617
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,040
Like, I don't think any,

2618
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,800
there's lots of stuff I would describe as like,

2619
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,040
maybe not something everyone eats,

2620
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,000
but nothing that's not considered a dish, you know.

2621
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:28,800
Yeah, yeah.

2622
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,720
I mean, I kind of eat, I mean, so like after,

2623
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,200
okay, I mean.

2624
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,560
There's even cans of beans, Nate,

2625
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,920
even your cans of beans.

2626
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,240
My famous patented dark red kidney bean cans,

2627
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,000
which I love, and I'm ready to eat.

2628
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,080
It's weird to eat as much of it as you eat,

2629
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,400
but it's not weird to eat kidney beans.

2630
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,280
Well, I wasn't even gonna bring that up.

2631
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,040
By themselves, I would say that it is.

2632
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,960
I mean, I eat them uncooked raw out of the can,

2633
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,560
and I do wash them off, I wash up the goose.

2634
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,200
Our example was yogurt sandwiches.

2635
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,600
I don't have anything like that.

2636
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,120
What I was gonna say was like,

2637
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,400
I feel like this sort of counts,

2638
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,320
so like after I work out,

2639
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
I would normally consume like protein,

2640
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
chocolate protein powers, just the kind I like,

2641
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,080
and then I have, I got the stuff creatine,

2642
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,920
which is, I don't know, it's famous and fitness stuff.

2643
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,360
It helps you grow muscle,

2644
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,720
but that's fruit punch flavor,

2645
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,800
and I used to drink them one after each other,

2646
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
and like that was like, oh, my stomach's full of water.

2647
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,680
What am I gonna do?

2648
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,400
Brilliant plan.

2649
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,440
I literally combined them,

2650
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,600
and I drink chocolate fruit powder,

2651
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,400
fruit punch mixture, and it's really gross,

2652
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,240
but I drink it anyway, because it's efficient.

2653
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,680
I did for a while do a thing that I think was actually good,

2654
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,680
and I don't understand why people thought this was weird,

2655
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,360
because I think it just makes sense,

2656
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,560
and it is tasty,

2657
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,240
but I would make my morning coffee,

2658
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,480
and then I would put a scoop of chocolate protein powder in it,

2659
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,040
and blend it into like a protein mocha thing.

2660
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,040
Dude, I tried to make a Ben Saint,

2661
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,440
and it got all, I think my protein was too sticky.

2662
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,200
That's not a Ben Saint, that's a Ben,

2663
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,560
well, I won't say my real last name,

2664
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,320
even though I don't care, and lots of people,

2665
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,400
yeah, yeah, that's the Ben, my real name,

2666
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,200
which I don't know why I'm being weird about it,

2667
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,680
but now I've done it, and I'm gonna stick to the decision.

2668
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,760
I like not saying my name on light, it's just fun.

2669
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,560
It's fun for me.

2670
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,400
The Ben Saint is, the Ben Saint is whole milk, ice, and cherry.

2671
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,480
Ben Saint's not your real name?

2672
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,920
Juice from a cherry, from a Maraschino cherry jar,

2673
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,280
plus some cherries.

2674
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,720
Wait a minute, that's your last name?

2675
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,160
That's my last name.

2676
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,720
Whoa, are we like related weird?

2677
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,680
Impossible.

2678
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,640
Wait, are you two keg and phantom horn from T-Pap?

2679
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,760
I never knew.

2680
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,040
Wait, you're saying that your real name,

2681
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,880
your real name isn't Guy Saint?

2682
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,760
What the?

2683
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,800
My real name isn't Standard, after all, I betrayed you all.

2684
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,280
Okay.

2685
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:27,920
That's bizarre.

2686
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,440
I, anyone else have an answer to this?

2687
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:29,840
Yeah.

2688
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,480
I wanna accuse Tom of having one.

2689
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,440
Me?

2690
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,480
Ooh, drama.

2691
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,600
Drama, alright.

2692
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,240
This isn't even something that's like weird to eat,

2693
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,120
it's just weird to think about the existence of,

2694
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,560
because Tom, I don't know if you still are,

2695
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,840
but you were a vegetarian.

2696
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,400
Are you still a vegetarian?

2697
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,520
I still am, yes.

2698
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,560
And you are big into Taco Bell,

2699
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,200
because they will replace the meat with beans

2700
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,480
on all of their stuff.

2701
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,680
Yeah, okay.

2702
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,960
Which to me has always been like,

2703
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,520
why the fuck do you have to go to Taco Bell as a vet?

2704
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,880
Just don't go to Taco Bell.

2705
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,440
It makes sense to me.

2706
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,920
Because Taco Bell's fucking great, I love fast food,

2707
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,720
and Taco Bell's amazing.

2708
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,520
Really eating, buddy.

2709
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,040
You're just collab with Report of the Week, Tom,

2710
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,360
in a big way.

2711
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,800
All of us should all die.

2712
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,000
I love Report of the Week.

2713
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,800
Oh my god.

2714
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,840
I love Report of the Week.

2715
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,120
I've never heard of this.

2716
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,520
Next piece of pee will be Report of the Week episode.

2717
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,080
Yeah.

2718
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,920
Him just like sitting there in his car,

2719
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,680
in his like, in his three-piece suit,

2720
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,880
with his fucking like,

2721
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,160
fastidiously fastened tie and his little pocket kerchief,

2722
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,280
just looking like a fucking,

2723
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,960
looking like a some 20-year-old like,

2724
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,480
Wall Street wannabe.

2725
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,720
No, you look like a fucking 12-year-old, dude.

2726
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,040
Yeah, yeah.

2727
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,360
He's just terrified of his mind.

2728
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,520
Same thing, same thing when you're ancient as the winds,

2729
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:37,920
like me.

2730
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,840
And just sitting there like,

2731
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,680
like bringing out, bringing out a little,

2732
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,120
a little packet of like,

2733
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,760
fucking a Burger King, like Cheetos,

2734
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,840
like Cheetos curly fries,

2735
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,080
and just being like, and talking at length,

2736
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,440
talking at length about like,

2737
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,800
the merits of these Cheetos curly fries.

2738
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,960
I've actually already done this back in,

2739
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,080
back in my youth.

2740
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,400
I had, I had a YouTube channel with my friend,

2741
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,520
we reviewed fast food,

2742
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,640
and we would record,

2743
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,000
we would record in the store,

2744
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,040
we brought the camera in.

2745
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,200
What if, what if this friend was right?

2746
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,920
What if this friend was right?

2747
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,720
Is it possible?

2748
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,280
Is it possible?

2749
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,640
The best thing about Tom's show

2750
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,240
is that they did it in the restaurant,

2751
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,840
like they would sneak a camera in,

2752
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,000
which was so much cooler than any of the other ones

2753
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,040
that do it in like their car,

2754
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,240
like game drops.

2755
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,560
The couple times that we, we did it at home,

2756
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,040
we would always drink Mountain Dew out of wine glasses.

2757
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,960
Sick.

2758
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,760
And I tried to copy your show, Tom.

2759
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,720
I tried to do the, the go into a place.

2760
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,080
I had like several ideas for fast food review shows,

2761
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,040
but one of them, me and my brother Shade,

2762
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,600
were just like recording a random podcast one time.

2763
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,800
This never saw the light of day,

2764
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,000
because it was terrible.

2765
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,880
But I had, I was holding the laptop

2766
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,920
with my fucking preamp plugged into it,

2767
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,200
sitting on top of the laptop,

2768
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,640
and I was holding the microphone,

2769
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,240
like XLR cord and everything,

2770
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,560
and just like walking to Taco Bell.

2771
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,120
Like we walked to Taco Bell over recording the podcast

2772
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,560
while walking on the side of the road.

2773
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,560
Then we walked in and I had Shade hold the laptop

2774
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,760
and everything while I ordered,

2775
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,760
and like everyone's giving us looks like,

2776
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,920
what in the flying fuck do you think you're doing, you know?

2777
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,920
So we sit down to start eating,

2778
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,600
just having the microphone going,

2779
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,000
and the manager comes out and he's like,

2780
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,680
yeah, you can't record in here.

2781
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,360
Can you like, and he made me,

2782
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,480
he made me delete the recording in front of him.

2783
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,000
But of course, what?

2784
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,520
But of course, he doesn't know

2785
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,280
that all you have to do is hit the X

2786
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,640
on audio track and audacity,

2787
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,760
and I went, it's done.

2788
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,720
And then of course as soon as it left,

2789
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,480
I controlled Zed and it was back.

2790
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,240
So, but it was a totally worthless recording anyways.

2791
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,840
So, I'm glad.

2792
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,080
We only got kicked out once, and I was at a KFC.

2793
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:43,120
But on the rest of the time, we just,

2794
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,800
we had free reign, we could do whatever we wanted.

2795
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,080
Nobody really cared.

2796
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,800
That's amazing.

2797
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,960
Unfortunately, you've never had

2798
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,040
another fast food review podcast

2799
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,480
in your entire life, did you?

2800
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,720
And you've been yearning for that in your entire life.

2801
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,120
The only intent, no, I've had a bunch,

2802
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,720
but there's one that's currently running.

2803
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,680
I say that, but there hasn't been an episode in months.

2804
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,880
I have fucking cried.

2805
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,560
Even though there's generations of past.

2806
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,400
Two of them have been recorded.

2807
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,120
The people cry out.

2808
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,200
It's true, it's true, it's unfortunate.

2809
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,200
Once a month, May looks at me and goes like,

2810
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,640
what the fuck is up with the fucking stealing your dad's?

2811
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,160
I'm like, I don't know, man, I don't know.

2812
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,720
Munchie's a busy boy, a busy boy.

2813
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,520
It'll happen, it'll happen.

2814
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,920
All right, one more question that I want to...

2815
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,360
Wait, let me read this meme one.

2816
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,400
This isn't a real question.

2817
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,760
It's just like, at Mark McAuley on Twitter asks,

2818
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,640
found out I'm at the same uni Gibbon attended.

2819
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,960
How cucked am I doing an animation degree?

2820
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,080
And then in parenthesis, he says,

2821
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,720
I recognized his animation in a show reel.

2822
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,520
First of all, cool, that's dope, dude.

2823
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,600
And I would like to say that second of all,

2824
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,080
Gib currently this month is working real hard

2825
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,600
on various gigs he's gotten through his efforts

2826
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,160
in animation shit, one of which is a commercial project.

2827
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,560
He's animating a whole fucking thing for a dude.

2828
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,400
So I'd say you're not completely fucked.

2829
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,520
I think he's writing for it.

2830
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,600
Well, there's that thing he's working with a company on,

2831
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,840
and then there's one guy he's just animating for.

2832
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,600
Yeah, yeah, so you're not totally fucked.

2833
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,600
A documentary or something like that.

2834
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,720
Oh, indeed.

2835
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:19,280
And I want to say that he goes into this on his Patreon's only podcast.

2836
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,120
Are you a patron of Gib?

2837
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,000
I am, actually.

2838
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,960
Shit, I want to hear that shit.

2839
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,480
Incidentally, I'm sure he would just link it to you if you asked.

2840
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,320
I will ask you.

2841
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,480
I've always been waiting for one of my friends

2842
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,040
to be interested enough in my Patreon exclusive content

2843
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,880
to ask me for it, but nobody is.

2844
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,000
It has never happened.

2845
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,600
There's too fucking much to do, bro, dude, I'm sorry.

2846
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,720
We're past the saturation point, it's true.

2847
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,800
But the Patreon podcast might be more up you guys' alley

2848
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:49,600
than a lot of the main...

2849
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,680
Here's the thing, Digi.

2850
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:55,680
We have exclusive access to your best friend's content,

2851
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,160
which nobody else has, because you don't have to pay shit for it.

2852
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,360
Oh, that's cute.

2853
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,160
Also, Digi, the snippets you've released of your podcast

2854
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,320
have been pretty interesting, so I actually would like to listen to those.

2855
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,280
There was at least one or two that I specifically wanted to send you, Nate.

2856
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,160
Oh, yeah?

2857
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,080
There's even one where I talk about you,

2858
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,520
and probably for some reason...

2859
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,000
I wouldn't hear that.

2860
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,280
...a utilitarian reason or something.

2861
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:14,720
Now I'm interested.

2862
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,920
For drama reasons.

2863
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,520
Anyway...

2864
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,280
That's where he announces that he's leaving the PCP joint

2865
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,800
and then the pizza party pod.

2866
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,840
It was a ruse all along to pay it out the unbelievers.

2867
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,320
Okay, all right.

2868
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,880
I really do regret having brought that to fruition,

2869
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,400
because I know it's gonna be a thing now.

2870
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:31,600
We'll see how it goes.

2871
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,240
All right.

2872
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:33,680
This is what I always wanted, dude.

2873
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,600
This is what I always wanted for us.

2874
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,000
It's so worth it, though, because if there's one podcast,

2875
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,480
I'd love for us to have a thing that's gonna be available.

2876
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:40,560
We need a battle.

2877
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
These fucking Rowdy fuckers' cop killers

2878
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,400
are a negative influence on the PCP,

2879
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,320
and we need to obliterate it.

2880
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,440
No, we need this.

2881
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,840
What is Sparkoil's undigisoul?

2882
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,600
What is Superman without Lex Luthor?

2883
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,320
You're so right.

2884
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,680
He needs an enemy.

2885
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,840
We need our nemesis within, of course.

2886
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,720
Of course, yes.

2887
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,120
All right, all right.

2888
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,640
Okay, Digi, listen.

2889
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,480
Visuals asks,

2890
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,160
if there was one piece of content you wish you never made,

2891
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,440
what would it be?

2892
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,160
It's easy.

2893
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:06,880
It's easy.

2894
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,240
Analyze this, Anarchy.

2895
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,200
Analyze this, Anarchy.

2896
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,480
I want to kill myself every time I think about it.

2897
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,080
Also, to remind everyone,

2898
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,560
I read the script and turned that down.

2899
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,640
I am literally 1,000 times smarter than Ben Superior

2900
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:17,280
in every way.

2901
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,320
I know things.

2902
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:18,640
Really?

2903
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,360
There you go.

2904
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,520
Fucked up, and it makes me mad.

2905
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,000
I don't know.

2906
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,600
Everything I've done is fucking flawless.

2907
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,160
I'll think.

2908
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:26,640
Go on, Digi.

2909
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,960
I think I, on some level,

2910
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,000
I don't know if I would have regretted this at the time,

2911
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,440
but by this point,

2912
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,800
I can't remember anything good

2913
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,680
having come from my most boring taste in anime video.

2914
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:42,400
Like, I feel like the point was mostly missed,

2915
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,080
and that even the people who did get the point,

2916
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,160
it didn't do anything to have gotten the point.

2917
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:52,240
All it did was ruin 3x3 threads on 4chan forever,

2918
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,360
which is actually great.

2919
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,200
I'm actually very happy with that result.

2920
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,920
But it also meant that I am forever inundated

2921
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,520
with people's 3x3s,

2922
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,840
and I don't care and have never cared.

2923
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,800
That's probably the video that had the worst consequences,

2924
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,560
and the worst cost benefit.

2925
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,240
Like, it had more cost than benefit to have made.

2926
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,880
I don't know why it became such a big deal in the first place,

2927
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,840
because it was,

2928
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,440
I shouldn't have given it a thumbnail,

2929
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,400
like, I give my video thumbnails

2930
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,640
when I think they can become big,

2931
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,440
and in that case, I was like,

2932
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,200
oh, this is a chance to be a big video,

2933
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,400
but I should have realized that I didn't want it to be a big video,

2934
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,560
and I fucked up by letting it become one.

2935
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:33,840
So.

2936
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,200
I have one.

2937
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,320
I have one.

2938
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,920
Even though I'm happy with it now,

2939
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,040
and I don't think it's bad,

2940
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,960
in hindsight, I do wish that I didn't do Nuzlocke Conquest,

2941
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,280
because it ended up being way more work

2942
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,400
than it was actually worth.

2943
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,120
But, you know, like, yeah.

2944
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,680
I kind of wish I had stopped after the first one.

2945
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,920
Nuzlocke Conquest should have just been made six months later

2946
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,320
after the champion was done,

2947
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,600
and then it would have made tabs.

2948
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,120
Yeah, it really should have,

2949
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,760
and it was foolish of me to want to jump right into it,

2950
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,800
just to coincide with the release of Sun and Moon.

2951
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,560
Because, like, it's a long-form series

2952
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,680
that came out over months.

2953
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:11,840
It's not like it was one big explosive thing

2954
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,680
that was like, oh, everyone who's hyped about Sun and Moon

2955
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,120
is going to want to watch this, you know?

2956
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:15,920
Right, right.

2957
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,440
I mean, it was a bit ill-conceived.

2958
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:21,360
In terms of marketing and, again, cost-to-benefit ratio stuff,

2959
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,240
like, yeah, it did succeed.

2960
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,000
Even though it's cool and people like it,

2961
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,120
like, it really did not do much of anything for me.

2962
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:30,160
I am, canonically, the biggest Nuzlocke Conquest fan,

2963
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:33,440
and I absolutely loved it, but that's what that just means.

2964
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,000
I mean, I like it.

2965
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,720
But that doesn't help you.

2966
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,760
That doesn't help you.

2967
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
No, not at all.

2968
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,560
I don't know.

2969
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,640
I guess I'll just use my old answer of, like,

2970
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,920
I worked way too long.

2971
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,640
All my old videos, I worked way too long on.

2972
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,200
The Lucifer and the Biscayne number one

2973
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,880
is, like, over-edited to the point of being

2974
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,920
almost, like, indecipherable to some extent.

2975
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,440
And the Undertale one is kind of like the two,

2976
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,760
but that has positives as well.

2977
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,440
Nothing I've made is, like, terrible,

2978
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,960
but I guess I would just say, like, the Lucifer,

2979
01:44:58,960 --> 01:44:59,920
because I worked too hard on it.

2980
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,800
But I am happy with what it is now, so I don't know.

2981
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,920
That's all I got.

2982
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,840
Tom, you got any videos you regret making?

2983
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,360
I probably should have done the leaving the fandom one better

2984
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,280
because it cost me, literally, all my money.

2985
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,480
But at the same time, it, like, set me on the path to making it.

2986
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,280
But what's that black money that was illicit money anyway?

2987
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,240
That's my whole point.

2988
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,040
It set me on the path to doing things that actually matter.

2989
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,200
So, like, I set out to make it because I wanted to do a hard,

2990
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,360
like, get out so I couldn't go back,

2991
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,360
because I knew I would just crawl back if I didn't.

2992
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,480
You succeeded there.

2993
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,160
I'm glad that happened, but at the same time,

2994
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,840
I'm perpetually broke forever now,

2995
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,160
and I'll probably never make money again, so.

2996
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,960
Unless I start some drama.

2997
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,640
So, that's kind of why I'm always on the show.

2998
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:41,360
Start some drama.

2999
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,240
I'm really poor.

3000
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,160
I could probably make some money with some drama.

3001
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,600
That's what we're all counting on.

3002
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,320
Give me money, guys.

3003
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:46,880
Don't make me start shit.

3004
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,440
The only way that it's going to work is if we are very careful

3005
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,080
to make ourselves not the bad guys in that drama,

3006
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,320
which is going to be difficult, you know?

3007
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,200
But we can manage.

3008
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,920
We can do it, though.

3009
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,640
I'm confident.

3010
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,480
We have the skills.

3011
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,280
The video I most regret in my entire life

3012
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,320
is not on any YouTube channel that I currently have access to.

3013
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
I've completely forgot the password for it.

3014
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,880
But I believe sometime around second or third grade,

3015
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,080
I made a YouTube video, right?

3016
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,920
Accidentally flipped off my grandmother,

3017
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,040
and I got really sad.

3018
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:13,680
I didn't.

3019
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,720
I apologize.

3020
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,760
I obviously bad it.

3021
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,080
You accidentally flipped her off.

3022
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,200
Absolutely intentional.

3023
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,480
I was trying to give her a thumbs up,

3024
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,120
but my brain forgot how to make the thumbs-up motion.

3025
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,400
I flipped her off instead.

3026
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,720
Well, the old bitch probably deserved it.

3027
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,920
Yeah, she did, if I'm honest with myself.

3028
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,960
Okay, I guess that's all our questions.

3029
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,000
That's it, everybody.

3030
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,520
Thanks for sending those using hashtag askpcp,

3031
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,360
and we're at TP Crasnators in Twitter.

3032
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,280
Or also by hashtag putting money into our fucking pockets,

3033
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,880
you absolute pig at the-

3034
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,520
Indeed.

3035
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,240
Most of the questions we read are from the Patreon,

3036
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,480
so that we can encourage you to become a patron.

3037
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,040
So-

3038
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:53,520
Exactly.

3039
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,200
Yeah, yeah, boy.

3040
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,160
So do that shit up.

3041
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,000
Become a patron at patreon.com slash the procrastinators,

3042
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,920
and you get fucking that shit happens.

3043
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,600
And of course, the $5 pledge.

3044
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,240
You get access immediately to all the bonus episodes.

3045
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:09,440
We are up to eight now, and the last one was alcohol.

3046
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,920
I'm on it.

3047
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,400
It was a-

3048
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:10,960
I was on it.

3049
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:11,840
Did you saw it?

3050
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,960
Yeah, and I got drunk, and DeVoo got shit-faced,

3051
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,000
and it was great.

3052
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,360
It was pretty fucking fun.

3053
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,080
Yeah.

3054
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,760
If you want documentation.

3055
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,920
We are also on iTunes and Google Play,

3056
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:24,080
so if you want to listen to these on your phone

3057
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,840
without having to keep a tab open or whatever,

3058
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,560
you can do that.

3059
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,800
Google Play Music and iTunes,

3060
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,640
just search for the procrastinators,

3061
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:32,400
the same way it's spelled on this video,

3062
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,600
and they'll come right up.

3063
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,440
Along with other podcasts we intend to murder,

3064
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
probably by starting drama with it sometime.

3065
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,080
Excellent.

3066
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,760
I can't fucking wait for this.

3067
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,000
And anything else?

3068
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,400
Merch, red bubble shit in the links below, whatever.

3069
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,680
Yeah, that's it, everybody.

3070
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,440
Like, comment, and subscribe.

3071
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,800
Oh man, someone finally tweeted a picture of himself

3072
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,960
wearing the sick PCP shirts that I designed,

3073
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,920
and I'm so proud of myself.

3074
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,880
It looks so great.

3075
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,920
Did you see that?

3076
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,880
I did see that.

3077
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,120
It looked incredible on a shirt.

3078
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,320
It looked pretty good.

3079
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,120
It looks pretty good.

3080
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,480
Yeah, it's hard to believe.

3081
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,040
I was like, I was so glad to see that.

3082
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:05,520
Good work, Ed.

3083
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,320
Incredible.

3084
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,640
I think that's all we had to say on the subject

3085
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:11,440
of our favorite subject in the entire world, ourselves.

3086
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,360
Bye!

3087
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,320
Bye!

3088
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:17,840
Yeah.

3089
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,320
Bitch.

3090
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:18,640
Yeah.

3091
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,080
Yeah.

3092
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,360
Yeah.

3093
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:21,920
Yeah.

3094
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:59,920
Ed, I don't want to do it.
