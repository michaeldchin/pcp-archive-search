by the way yeah i am all right well i don't know let me let me know if you got any input on character

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,720
creation now i like how there's only two animal preferences in this game as as i got intended

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,720
do these matter at all uh well like you'll have a pet in the game and it'll either be a cat or a dog

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,600
i feel like that's i gotta i wish i could i wish i could click this blank space over here and pick

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,960
none please there's a very clear killer ratty preference here it's very clear that killers

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,360
are cats and rats are dogs oh no i hate that i hate that don't say that i mean i mean can you

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,280
argue against it yeah killers hate animals okay well sure fine but if you were i mean of the two

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,040
it's a it's a soccer team experiment you see no i'm not i'm not indulging i'm not indulging this

41
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
that's my goal here whenever there's a game like this i always just randomize until i get the

42
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,720
worst looking one and then i play with that it's not that's not how i operate i operate i operate in

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,800
a stupid way i mean like like all things in your life anyway in about two hours uh i'm being forced

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,800
to go to jay jay c pennies and wear some rented uh graduation gown and cap pose for the jay c penny

45

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,520
i used to steal socks look at this ghost shirt that's fucking cool i would wear that

49
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,120
ooh what was that oh go back to that purple what this purple one yeah this is like something a

50
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,400
it's like a pilgrim would wear what no kind of like this sweater this like gray sweater

51
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,400
mm is this what half of the episode is gonna be been you gotta you gotta move on with our lives we

52
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,680
can't stay in the past like this look we're gonna be looking at this oh there it is there it is look

53
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,400
at that i see it look look at it um we're gonna be looking at this for the rest of the game so

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
yeah i mean get get comfortable oh wait look look at that like double rested like sanji fucking

55
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:35,120
okay what are these like locations on the side are these houses wilderness farm i think this is

56
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,200
yeah this is location and i think it determines some some shit about the game like i'm pretty sure

57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,240
wilderness is hard mode uh man okay so it seems kind of a it seems kind of a you don't wait should

58
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,480
i be a juvie that would be really cute should i should i just be a juvie farman i think i think

59
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,880
that would i think i think our stocks would skyrocket if you were to do that all right

60
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,920
just an all just on all neon green man searing the the uh residents of this local town terrorizing

61
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,640
here we go here we go the juvie's animal preference would be like a goldfish or like

62
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:30,000
something not threatening um it would be like it would be like uh dandelions yeah it would be

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,200
their imaginary friend look at this hair jesus christ yeah it's pretty good right oh it's really

64
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,160
as Nina moria would say if she was still alive today hey speaking of high school graduation

65
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,760

68
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,760
even when you i mean i could tell i could tell from the photos that even when you were young you had

69

95
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,120
actually in the game hey yeah we're only 11 minutes in huh uh uh you can now uh devote some of your

96
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,440
mental power from choosing outfits to participate maybe you know we'll see we'll see about that

97
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:10,240
um so uh yeah how's it going nice one how's how are you how's it going over there

98
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,560
buddy it feels good it's it's sort of a surreal scenario to be recording especially rfck again

99
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,600
rfck is sort of the uh show where i don't have to like pretend to be someone i'm not like how i do

100
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,800
on every other uh performance piece like the pcp or anything it's like a defragmentation for my mind

101
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,080
so i don't even have to uh you know like uh scream or yell i i feel like it's just a a place for

102
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,440
nothing to happen and that's what makes it good yeah it's get ready for a whole lot of nothing

103
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,320
viewers it's entertaining the same way that gossip is or gossip makes it feel like oh you're like

104
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,520
you're on the inside of something you're you're like uh you're privy to knowledge not the not the

105
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,120
average bear is i feel like the same with rfck where it's not particularly like entertaining

106
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,680
like a song and dance or like a particularly good homeless show it's more like a homeless show like

107
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,200
a boss fights no like dancing you know you know but well you see well you see ben i come from new

108
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,160
a new york city impotencies nyc and at least there the homeless have the dcd dance for that

109
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,560
money that makes the difference between a classy homeless person dot dot dot and a bomb really

110
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,240
wow you learn something new every day anyway that's what rfck is like is it like a homeless fight

111
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:42,480
hell yeah hell yeah buddy um we we were just privy to some major goss i mean i think i've got

112
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,760
you and me yeah you and me together when uh our uh uh what do we call it is there a personal

113
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,000
name ragcon 3.33 uh i don't think we should call it that uh but i don't know what i would call it

114
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,640
either i don't want to call it the meetup which is what i think we called it an all-planning

115
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:08,000
the meetup i mean that's all it was true is uh there's a whole lot of it was a whole lot of

116
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,520
nothing if you know what i mean there's a whole lot of nothing going on oh i i i do know i say

117
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:22,880
making a jackoff motion with my hand oh hell yeah bro um okay so what so what about it what about the

118
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:30,320
goss oh i'm just saying that i mean it was basically nothing but that uh there was goss sure

119
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,680
this is sort of like a continuation of of a long running storyline that was started way back in

120
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,080
frog fractions two episode one that i think uh it's sort of a culmination of all that uh there's

121
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,080
been many false culminations where this might be the real culmination i mean they if like fucking

122
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,880
hopefully hopefully this one will stick fine i actually don't know what you're talking about

123
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,720
i mean that this feels like uh way back in frog fractions two episode one we're talking about

124
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
oh peace to be friendship we want to be all close together oh yeah blah blah blah blah

125
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,880
whole bunch of nothing and uh there's been a bunch of uh you know development on that if i develop i

126
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:25,280
mean maybe in fact uh the opposite of development and in fact the regression um such you know i feel

127
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,560
fine i think i think everything's i think everything's gonna work out just fine with all

128
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,760
that i'm you know i left feeling a little dismayed but uh upon reflection you know upon

129
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,600
mulling it over hearing everyone else mull it over i you know you know everyone's everyone's

130
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,960
gonna everyone's gonna settle into what they want what they want you know what they want to be doing

131
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,280
where they want to be it's all gonna come to its natural equilibrium point uh might be

132
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,440
in too vague here i don't know how how how into this do you want to get i'm sure i'm sure there's

133
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,480
uh is any of it like is any of it like proprietary i i don't think so but i get the feeling that others

134
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:18,080
might think so are these rocks what are these things what logs no these oh yeah those are rocks

135
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,640
but i think i need like a hammer i think i need a hammer to destroy them and i don't have a hammer

136
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:33,760
uh i can get one somewhere fiber i got fiber you do please got wood why is there a hole in my porch

137
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,800
why is there a hole in my porch i don't know anyway uh i

138
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,160

139
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,240
this video we can always uh make sure that no one right clicks the url this video as soon as it goes

140
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,960
public and then uh downloads as an mp4 and uh saves it before we can delete it hell yeah

141
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:15,280
no no load please uh well no load um what am i saying you know uh you know it seems like

142
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,760
nate doesn't you know at the time it was like nate wants to do the thing with digi

143
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,120
and did do that this new show or whatever and digi wants to move so nate was gonna move and i was

144
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,400
like ah but do you want to i don't think you want to go i didn't say this because i don't want to

145
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
tell anyone how to live their lives or anything but i was thinking like you're gonna do it publicly

146
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:47,360
now instead well i mean this is after the dust has settled right uh okay i you know i i was i mean i

147
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,280
i mean i told him this in a call or something uh i was like at the time i thought uh you know do

148
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:02,560
do you actually want to go where digi's going um wherever that is and then you have to remember

149
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,920
that no one knows what this meeting is about it's stuff from the very beginning do i i know how would

150
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,600
anyone know what has happened well we were meeting to discuss like who where people were you know i mean

151
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,240
basically the meeting was just where is digi moving that was it that was the meeting and i i didn't

152
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,240
like it i was very i was very bored i had very little contributed uh from my perspective pcphq

153
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,480
for a while now has been settled like tom digi you and me eventually in yeah in just a short while

154
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,120
will be in the same place and so i thought wow only nate and then maybe hippo need to come and then

155
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,360
like you know oh it's there it is for a while i've been saying like opcpq is founded like the

156
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,600
foundation is already there there's already things happening as because of it i'm games

157
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:03,680
prime example uh but uh somewhat to my surprise last time uh i was there i found out uh apparently

158
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,720
the the seeds of discourse were planted and in fact it's not at all uh figured out or decided

159
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,560
well it's it's very much an open question well it's just digi wants to move digi doesn't like

160
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:24,480
boston for reasons uh i don't get them i mean i think i've tried i think we've all tried to

161
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,120
i think you've all tried to dissuade him he doesn't like the cold the what cold he doesn't

162
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,880
like to shovel that's not that's not really the reason i don't know it's not no that's like

163
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,640
that's like eight why that's i mean that's like eighth thing down the list and the first seven are

164
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:50,880
my house is too expensive um and like i don't know there are cheaper houses but i just don't

165
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:01,120
i don't know if he wants to hear it uh yeah well well anyway whatever anyway uh this this

166
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,520
this whole mean we've we attended we gathered everyone up it was just supposed to be like i

167
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
was there and then you guys were already and then Nate was gonna fly on then hippo just surprise

168
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,120
yeah uh everyone like like a week before and came out uh which was cool

169
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,920
very uh it was a great time i don't really care about getting like to the meeting specifically

170
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,120
though i know people will be clamoring for it in in the comments and stuff like that

171
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,920
but frankly i don't really care about what was discussed yeah yeah i'm with you i'm with you

172
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,600
like it was a bunch of stuff that doesn't really concern me no a bunch of i didn't i didn't like

173
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,480
i said i i didn't really bear that much on me personally it doesn't matter where anyone else

174
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,640
because i'm not planning on leaving here so a bunch of stuff in the future deciding where people

175
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:01,520
want to live their lives uh seems like it's possible that psphq will not be in boston and you know

176
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
like sad question mark

177
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,720
like i i think about it in the sense that like who do i want to be around in my life

178
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,920
for various reasons you know work or or socially i don't know if i need to be around everyone

179
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,520
you know i like you ben as you might be able to tell i don't know if you can gay gay gay gay gay gay

180
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,400
gay and so i want to be in boston or you know around you because we do work together and we're

181
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,720
good friends yeah same thing with other psp members but not like everyone i don't know if i need to

182
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,200
be in pcphq i don't know if i care about like the the group it has a concept i used to i don't

183
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,680
know if i do anymore not through any degradation of character but just out of uh i know what you mean

184
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:01,120
like you know me like i like hippo but we don't like do anything to get i mean maybe if we lived

185
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:08,880
nearby we would but as it currently stands we don't and that's you know nothing wrong with that

186
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,720
um but like we don't need to you know let live together i mean same with me and tom like i like

187
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:22,960
tom i like hanging out with tom if you know he moved it wouldn't disrupt anything about what

188
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,560
i'm doing you know right uh funnily enough the two people you mentioned are the two people who i would

189
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,880
like to be near the most well yeah i mean so would i i'm just saying it's not yeah it's not a it's

190
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,240
it's not like a yeah i i get me mean yeah i i i i i i it just feels like there's no real like

191
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,800
there's no real like personal professional crossover there is what i'm saying that's all that's all

192
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,080
i'm saying dog i i get you yeah i get you and i'm in the same boat it it's like you know there

193
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,680
there are two reasons we have someone either you like them a whole lot or you know you have work

194
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,280
with them and you know if they can overlap then that's good but you know sometimes you can just

195
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,280
work with someone a lot and you know you like them but you don't have to be near them to work with them

196
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,280
in the case of digi like i mean what what would we do together in person that we could not do

197
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,760
over the internet like why do we have to live together not a whole lot of reason we don't have

198
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,320
like similar interests it's not like we have the same i conception of like what to do to have fun

199
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,640
so it's not like we would have that social relationship necessarily let's say that i'm not

200
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:40,640
friends digi you obviously understand that yeah um yeah nobody understands hating digi bro more than

201
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:49,040
been yeah yeah gotcha yeah uh man i feel like i kind of didn't really use my didn't really use all

202
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,480
my energy today you know you gotta you gotta be efficient in this game you gotta use your resources

203
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,200
much much like the stock market much much like the stock market you gotta be you gotta be schmott

204
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,520
you gotta be it's a pretty risky game i mean you know vegetation is on the line

205
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,120
it's it's it's it's not a risky game if you know how to play it it's a lot yeah yeah it's not not

206
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,280
if you know how to play it have we told that story should we tell that story on but you definitely

207
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,320

and he was upset about it if i if i were in that scenario it wouldn't be like oh dammit it would be

255
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:45,680
bitch of a son why is it that always the hardest men have the softest sons is that true yeah i yeah

256
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,040
didn't you hear did i hear you say it just now yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good

257
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:58,240
point um man i don't know you know some things are just a mystery and that's one of them ben would

258
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:14,640
i'd be able to beat up your son like newborn i mean did you get the drop on him no fair it's a

259
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,560
duel a fair fight i'd know no i don't think so no i'm sorry what what what what techniques what

260
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:32,320
skills does he have could he possibly retain um well he uh you know uh like not before you before

261
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,520
it goes to the ground right like on the ground it's all it's all about holds you know but like

262
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,960
before that it's all about momentum and um you know a baby a properly trained baby

263
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,400
you know the the the the mass differential between the two combatants is massive therefore

264
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,200
you know proper technique at redirecting momentum is is even more devastating

265
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,520
uh i've got two questions for you about your son number one how much does he weigh

266
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,680
number two was the date he born on significant for any other reasons such as was it a holiday

267
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,400
was it perhaps uh uh the uh you know the date of a historical event is does he get any sort of

268
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,720
date bonus um was he born on like january 1st and therefore had like psychic abilities first

269
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:35,840
dancer wait almost nothing second dancer um um talk like a pirate day and he hates it because

270
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,040
every year for his birthday he gets he gets novel he gets novelty hooks he gets novelty

271
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,720
hooks to wear over his hand because because you know everyone's because everyone's just

272
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,280

274
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,800

320
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,840
actually i don't think your dad is relevant in this game it's just your your grandpa's

321
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,520
dead though and he left you his farm it doesn't seem like a game i enjoy what a game about your

322
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,160
grandpa being dead no a game without a visible father figure i mean i mean i mean some people

323
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,640
play games to relax some people play games for monetary benefit i play games to uh reconnect

324
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,480
with my father by pretending that i have one i wonder i wonder if uh maybe i mean if if your

325
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,280
dad is not otherwise mentioned maybe maybe it's possible this guy is your dad maybe willy the

326
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,360
sailor is your secret dad the whole time i mean it's not a secret he calls you son

327
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,640
yeah but he was disguising it with colloquialism right like as all good fathers do

328
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,080
disguise and their true intentions hey ben why do you hate your parents don't like you asked me

329
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,800

342
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:54,640
throats about about that sweet old man i don't i you know he wasn't always old believe it or not

343
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:03,120
um i don't know you just fucking be on my case about everything all the time and it really pissed

344
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:10,800
me off that's it that's the story not there's there's i know it's it's there's nothing to it um

345
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,360
he's just a jerk he was like a really like uh he's very he's very particular kind of like

346
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,440
he's very he's very like detail oriented he's very much like all about fuck he's all about like

347
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,680
you know keep keep keep everything keep all your ducks in a row keep everything really like well

348
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,040
categorized keep a keep a keep a spreadsheets he would like he would like draft up um he would

349
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:45,440
like draft up contracts for us to sign uh a lot what he would he would he would he would be like

350
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,840
we would have like a family meeting and be like okay here are all the chores here's all the chore

351
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,800
listings or whatever here's how we're like dividing the labor of the house does everyone agree to

352
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,400
ratify this agreement suddenly so many things make sense you just say in that yeah suddenly

353
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
everything falls into place does everyone does everyone agree to ratify this agreement okay

354
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,680
then everyone sign like everyone is expected to sign within the week or whatever this i want to

355
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:19,120
say is a completely obvious assessment though it like like like like literally however it feels

356
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,480
right you can either like become brainwashed by your parents or hate your parents you know

357
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,360
it's either you either you either become them or you go the opposite yeah there's i mean i mean

358
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,600
there's no other option to do you either are like the more you aren't yeah but it's either i feel

359
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:39,600
like it's intense you know i feel like it's a uh neither you know nate obviously would do that and

360
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:46,480
does that in real life currently now you know as as i was saying that i was realizing that's like

361
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,880
very that's very that yeah the way he like the way he was at radcon was or not right the way he was

362
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,880
at the meet-up rather is just a very very that was a very dead uh way to be i wonder if he'd be mad

363
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,560
i wonder if he'd be mad hearing me say that maybe but it was why would that why would that be bad

364
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,600
you know nobody wants to nobody wants to become their parents right isn't that like a thing like

365
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,160
you know you get you start getting into adulthood and then suddenly you realize you've become your

366
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,880
parents and you have an existential meltdown um sounds like a cartoon and if you know there's

367
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,360
one thing that i hate it's cartoons uh is this procedurally generated by the way the town is

368
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:36,960
not i think the farm is uh or no i'm gonna go with no i don't think there is a procedurally

369
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,240
generated part there's like a dungeon in the game there's like a what yeah there are mines and in the

370
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,360
mines there are monsters that you have to like fight with so yeah yeah yeah there are monsters you

371
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,640
have to fight with swords and that dungeon is procedurally generated but i think the rest of the

372
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:05,360
game is not okay does that answer your question poorly uh i want a hammer i know i have to buy

373
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:14,880
it somewhere but i don't remember where uh so so i imagine i'm i'm i'm i'm hard on this father

374
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,280
kick as you can as you can probably tell so so so he would just get mad at you about like if your

375
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:27,920
room being messy or whatever or something um more sinister things yeah i guess like nothing like

376
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,920
unusually yeah i remember room being messy but like i don't know i just always thought he had

377
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,760
a shit attitude about it he was always very like like when he was mad he was very like self

378
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,600
righteous he was very like i like the reason like the like this i am not i am not upset for practical

379
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,440
reasons i'm upset for moral reasons you know like what you have done is wrong uh and i hated it uh

380
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,360
really pissed me off every every every single time i remember there was one time i think i was in

381
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,600
like i might have been in college and i was home for this and i don't remember what was happening

382
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,920
i think he was doing he was doing the thing he was doing the boomer thing he was like ben get a job

383
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:24,000
but don't like apply online he's like no ben you you must you must like because applying for jobs

384
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,640
online doesn't look like work right like it looks easy you're just sitting there you're just

385
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,320
sitting around the house you know sitting on the computer you know applying for jobs online

386
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,760
bullshit you gotta get out there and you gotta pound the pavement son you gotta get out there in the

387
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,480
car do you say pound the pavement yes he said pound the pavement you gotta get out there in the car

388
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,320
you gotta drive around for eight hours a day i want you out of the house in the car for eight

389
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:58,320
hours a day going to every fucking shitty restaurant in like in like in concentric circles around the

390
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:05,200
town hand them an application that's how i want you that's how i want you find and work around

391
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:12,480
here and i was just like oh god this is i hate i hate it i hate it this is dumb and we got mad

392
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,200
we got into a fight and i'm and i'm like i'm like livid right i'm fucking like i'm like

393
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,840
i'm probably i'm like totally losing my composure as we're having the fight and he and he's and he's

394
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,880
getting and he's getting mad too right we're getting heated and he sees that i'm heated

395
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,880
and he says he says ben control your rage and i'm like i can't believe you're a real person

396
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,000
it makes me so mad that you are who you are i didn't say that like i don't remember what i

397
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,160
said but that was the that was the feeling and that was you know so there so anyway that's why i hate

398
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:59,920
my parents that's a pretty good reason yeah uh what what a fucking fascinating story

399
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:07,280
i i'm i'm i'm i'm particularly enthralled by by pound the pavement uh hashtag that put that on a

400
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,520
shirt like pound the pavement you know it's real right it's that's like a cliche but it's real he

401
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,400
lives it i i imagine the solution to your problem would just be like have a laptop and then and then

402

there is like a time i think you have like a certain number of years and after that number

416
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:54,160
of years goes by um your grandpa like comes back no it's your dad your dad or your grandpa or whatever

417
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,360
comes back to like see how you've done and if you've done everything you need to do you get good end

418
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:08,400
um but the uh in this game there is no time limit per se but there is a calendar and like

419
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,080
certain events will happen on certain days of the year but like there's no limit to how many years

420
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:25,840
you can do shit is there a win state uh i don't think so i mean you can get married uh you can

421
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:32,160
get married and have a kid um but yeah is he like the npc bot that does the farm stuff for you

422
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:43,760
the kid no no that would be really funny here we go look at all the stone you're getting i god i

423
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,560
feel so stupid i'm sure how long are we in we're like for 45 minutes and i'm sure for the last

424
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,600
like half an hour someone has been screaming at me like you idiot just use the pickaxe just break

425
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,720
the stones with the pickaxe what did i think the pickaxe was for i don't know i just thought it was a

426
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:09,600
scythe but thinner that's my story like yeah gotcha i love seeing rip through that those that tall grass

427
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:16,560
please dude we go i'm gonna kill so many pokemon hell yeah i love this yeah this is so satisfying

428
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,600
you know you can cut the tall grass in pokemon like in the real games yeah yeah yeah with cut that's

429
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,320
so crazy i have no idea i think you you could yeah you could even as far back as red and blue

430
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:39,040
why yeah i know right like why did they why like i mean it doesn't detract from the game

431
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,640
no really sure but doesn't doesn't really add anything you know about it yeah no i found that

432
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,640
out and i did it and i was like oh my god this game this game doesn't even work and yet they included

433
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,120
that yeah yeah the moves just don't do what they're supposed to do and yet they were like you know

434
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,640
would be really nice to put on top of this broke ass game that doesn't work just a nice cute little

435
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,440
feature where you can cut the grass with the grass tm i think they'd really appreciate that and you

436
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:18,320
know what they were right it makes easy to backtrack i guess huh makes it easier to backtrack i guess

437
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,800
i mean i guess if you really don't want to have a random encounter but it's probably

438
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,680
by repel it's just faster to walk maybe if you're like maybe if you're if you're nuzlocking right

439
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,600
because they because when they were making red and blue they were planning for that no they're

440
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,880
like if someone's nuzlocking this game and like they really need to get to a pokemon center like

441
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,160
and they really don't want to have and they're like really low they really don't want to have a

442
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,640
random encounter you know let's include this this cut the grass feature um you know fell appreciated

443
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:57,440
whoa look at this right seed seed fell right into that oh i can't oh i can't fucking get it

444
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,600
the seaweed get the eat seaweed hell hell yeah i'm gonna eat that seaweed that refill your energy

445
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:14,640
um i think so is it like crafting is this like minecraft i uh you know i haven't played that

446
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,720
much of this game i know that you can take you need materials to like upgrade your tools i don't

447
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,040
know if there's like crafting from scratch but i think probably like probably there are npcs in

448
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:36,800
town who will like combine shit for you into potions and stuff and energy potions or something

449

488
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,280
words you can say either way but i think no i'm gonna bet no i'm putting my foot down on this one

489
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,120
we were talking about productivity and and projects and we're doing some of those our lives

490
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:16,560
oh yeah at uh at the meetup there was a legendary long night of discussion with me you tom caroline

491
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:23,760
and michelle for kazi for anyone that doesn't know caroline is kazi whatever whatever well

492
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:34,000
okay fine who cares okay anyway in in in uh conversation it wax and waned many times

493
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,040
it ranged from various uh explicit stories you told about about you know sluts you've banged

494
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,840
yeah and and interdates you've been on and uh it eventually it eventually uh uh you know devolved

495
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,120
into a sort of understated sorrow about how much uh oh we don't uh contribute to society and how our

496
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,680
lives are uh you know not what they could be uh huh there there's written there was a lot of talk

497
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:10,160
about how uh we aren't productive enough about how we are uh sad saps that one right and uh i i feel

498
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:19,440
like i i've been on a sort of productivity uh thank space for a few months now and that was a

499
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
a really great conversation to have and i'm very much interested in what other people

500
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,160
had to say about their about the productivity about how they work and about uh what what they

501
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:34,960
accomplish and so i was happy to have that conversation that was the catalyst for uh uh

502
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,200
i feel like at least for you i mean you you had a real fire in your eyes after that conversation

503
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,800
you had a real like you know drive to to work on stuff again after us talking about how uh

504
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,680
we'll never be andrew hustling we have an updated comics every single day for a year so i'm gonna

505
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:59,040
eat this raw heron thanks uh uh what what and and just last night you said that you had been

506
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:07,520
more productive than you ever been in months so um i said that i feel that i have become more

507
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,360
productive for a hot second there i mean

508
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:21,760
for between between maybe like uh i don't know

509
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:31,440
up up to like maybe september like it's not that i didn't feel like i was working but like the work

510
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:40,480
that i was doing was not i would like spend like a whole week or whatever like fucking around with

511
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:46,800
like the store you know like the rfck storefront which was like a waste of that very i remember

512
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:53,760
that very vividly that was like a like a real like section of your life yeah it was like a week an

513
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:01,440
entire like two weeks i spent and like it's so dumb like i don't i know i know how that sounds

514
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:09,120
i know you think about that and you're like how could it have possibly taken that long and yeah true

515
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:18,080
but like i found ways i found like i was working like hard i was like going at it like

516
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:24,000
constantly moving between like okay you know set setting up the store you know looking like oh well

517
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,920
making making new products uh making new um uh like look like compare like making a spreadsheet

518
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,120
to like compare like prices and product margins between like the different uh you know the different

519
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,480
store like which one is the best deal which one is the has the best this which one has the

520
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,080
best that where should i make this that and the other thing you know gotta maximize gotta make

521
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,560
it as efficient as possible gotta make it you know good looking gotta make it gotta make assets

522
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:55,760
gotta make banners gotta make icons you know i made it i made it uh take fucking where's the

523
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:04,640
goddamn blacksmith where's the goddamn blacksmith munchie what did you what have you done listen

524
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,680
i'm i won't tell you where he is but all i'll say is that you'll never be able to find him

525
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,440
can you enter the sewer also you were midthought what

526
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:27,600
oh you're just talking about oh uh anyway and you know that that i was kind of doing the same

527
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,920
thing with endless war like i was working on endless war but like there wasn't a lot like

528
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,360
there weren't a lot of moments when i was like okay this is done like it's done and i did a thing

529
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,400
i would just kind of i don't know it wasn't efficient and it was bad like like when i did it

530
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,440
when i did um slime oids like when i finally got back to slime oids like i had left that

531
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,440
for a while because i was like oh that's hard and i don't remember how to do it but when i

532
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,680
finally got back into it like i did it and then within like a week of restarting like it was done

533
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,720
and they came out and it was a new thing and it was it was done um we've got to process this geode

534
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,160
that that's a very interesting thought about how you can do a lot of work more work than you

535
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,200
would do normally but still have it feel like you haven't accomplished anything yeah i feel like that

536
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:24,160
especially recently when i'm doing more long-term projects like endless war where you can do i

537
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,840
upgrade my inventory or something sorry this is pissing me off okay okay i don't think anyone

538
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,640
would be like particularly surprised to find out that i haven't been like the most productive

539
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,280
member of the pcp or anything like that for the past you know whatever three years or something

540
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:48,880
but i feel like it might feel like to anyone looking in that i've been particularly absent

541
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,680
like i haven't made a whole lot of things recently but i feel like i've accomplished

542
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,440
way more not just in the sense that like i've been doing things outside of the internet

543
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,000
but even just the stuff i've been doing on there has had more thought put into it and i mean

544
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,240
stuff like endless war sure you can like push an update but even that doesn't feel like it's

545
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,640
anything new doesn't feel like a product you've made yeah like i can release a new video i can

546
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:23,120
be like wow new video no one can deny that i've made a thing yeah but even when you're making

547
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:29,760
like code or something you know it may even still feel then you know you put something out you still

548
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,640
feel like it's just been you know you've added upon something it's not like a a new thing you've

549
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,720
done making yeah making slime woods felt like it almost felt like a new thing because it was sort of

550
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,720
like a game within the game but even that is still like like the product the product is still

551
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:53,360
endless war which you know has kind of been out so it's not like a new yeah it's a little it's a

552
01:01:53,360 --> 01:02:00,480
little it's a little bit of a drag honestly that like yeah endless war is one thing and you can't

553
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,920
be like hey guys it's out because like it's already out yeah even though it's even though it's constantly

554
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:16,400
being expanded and and we probably like like like it's possibly reached its its natural base

555
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,560
you know without what do you mean well i mean like anyone who would have clicked on it from the

556
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:34,720
pcp audience oh i see i see what you mean um yeah well oh man i was gonna say this is why

557
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:43,440
we need to advertise and maybe we still do but i'm but i'm project wonderful doesn't exist anymore

558
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,000
didn't realize didn't realize did you know that you can date this guy no you can date this guy

559
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,400
i think cool yeah imagine that like an old guy he's like old and shit and you can date him

560
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:11,840
sick hell yeah um uh uh oh yeah project wonderful um doesn't exist anymore uh sad bad uh i was like

561
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,760
oh well i guess i'll just have to find lol the guy's got no shirt on haha i guess i'll just have to

562
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,360
find another whatever service replaced it you know and advertise with them the answer is nothing

563
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,400
replaced it all the web comics that had project wonderful ads on them now just have nothing um

564
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:38,080
so you know marketing opportunities gone uh i actually got a lot of traffic to my website in

565
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,560
the past i didn't do this all the time but every now and then i would advertise through project

566
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:49,440
wonderful and the results were not earth shattering but i definitely got traffic for what i would

567
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:56,800
consider to be generally a reasonable price so i'm actually pretty bummed and i think there's a

568
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:03,440
missed opportunity here there's lost there's a lost opportunity costs with endless war uh itself

569
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,800
um i mean the i seems like the alternative is like google ads google ad words which i don't

570
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,480
know anything about but that's what they say that's what people say is like probably the other

571
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,200
thing to advertise uh with uh but i don't know

572
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:31,920
yep well i mean google ad words just sounds evil it's a yeah sure sure oh my god there's a goth boy

573
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,120
oh my god there's nothing more there's like he's a killer he's a fucking killer avoid

574
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,600
avoid i gotta play this i gotta play this game like a juvie i gotta think like a juvie if i want

575
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,200
to survive oh yeah he is in this in this world it's killer be killed

576
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,400
how many i have to make uh i need to meet i need to greet three more people

577
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,880
in this world it's easily be killed in this world it's be killed

578
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:15,360
uh truly life is hell for a young juve what would you so so would you say that you've

579
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,400
like like how would you say you've been more productive recently because i mean do you

580
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,240
still feel that way you said for a hot second you felt competitive is that is that weighing at all

581
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,160
um

582
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,120
may it well i don't feel that productive today because like for the last couple days

583
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,760
i've done other shit and i haven't gotten anything done um so maybe you don't like it like

584
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:46,640
there's like social stuff yeah yeah like i fucking went on that failed tinder day at lull

585
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:54,000
do you want to talk about that sure i guess um well but like you know other than that like i got my

586
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,520
poo videos coming out and those are good i'm doing you know i kept i've kept to my schedule

587
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:09,360
for two weeks now and that feels pretty good uh i'm not actively working on the secret project

588
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:16,960
the secret the secret uh rfck project in the unholy slime dungeon right now um because i'm

589
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:23,440
kind of just waiting for kind of waiting for there to be a little more there to work with um

590
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,840
but like once it's done like the hard part will be over and it will probably take less work than

591
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:38,880
slime oids did to get to get that new feature up and off the ground um oh hey a plant

592

i can't okay um fuck what was i oh my date my tinder date uh man boy so all right uh

593
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:59,600
the way i've been i don't look at tinder much sometimes when i'm bored i will just open it up

594
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,760
and just swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe right right right right right until there's nothing left

595
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,400
sometimes although that's a lot and i don't i don't have the patience to do that anymore um

596
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,480
they'll just swipe swipe swipe swipe see how many matches i get and then don't do anything don't

597
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:21,600
message them or whatever such a weird system wait what it's just it's like uh yeah well it's

598
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:28,160
not a system bunch it's not designed to get results like you're pulling a wide net and

599
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,040
laying the fishes die on the seabed that's yeah that's literally yeah i'm passing the widest net

600
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,360
possible pulling in all the fish letting them die right on my deck yep that that's that's how it's

601
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:45,040
been um and it's fucking sick yeah oh i if you if you couldn't tell it's great it's the best

606
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:18,400
is to be believed he has fucked before very hard in multiple occasions thanks thanks man that's

607
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:24,880
that's that's my uh statement i mean don't don't believe it but if it is to be believed which it

608
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:36,000
isn't um okay what what happened the day um right so i've been letting these these fish as you call

609
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:45,040
them as you call women so sexistly um and so aptly as well so and aptly yeah um die on on the vine

610
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:54,640
to mix my metaphors a little bit um but uh this this time this time you know she messaged me and

611
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:01,680
she's like hey how whatever and i'm like hey and um she's like i look at her pictures and like she's

612
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:08,080
fine and like here's the thing you expect you expect people to look worse in person than they

613
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:14,000
do in the picture so i'm looking at this and i'm like in the pictures she looks fine she looks

614
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,160
you know pretty all right in reality she's probably worse than all right because that's

615
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:28,880
how it works however however um i should probably be out of my house more often so i'm like so that

616
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,560
makes up the difference and i'm like okay fuck it so we talked for a while on tinder and we're

617
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,920
basically just like hey and and i'm just i'm just we're just like so you want to just meet up and

618
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,840
fuck around and she's like i guess and she's like but it's like you know we're gonna like meet up and

619
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,400
like chat first you know so she knows i'm not an x-murder because that's what you do you meet up

620
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,840
you briefly chat you make sure they're not a fucking murderer or a scammer or a psycho or whatever

621
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:04,160
and then you can fucking it's fine and whatever but so we meet up and i'm so i say so there's a

622
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,920
thing or it's like oh am i gonna go to her like i would have to take a bunch of trains to get to

623
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,760

627
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,080
and that's pretty much it i mean what else is there when you get right down to it

628
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,560

not much more to tell you that's how i got that's how i got dumped i don't know like why like you

690
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:14,080
know i like i get home you know i look at tinder i'm i'm deleted i'm unmatched and i'm like okay as

691
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:22,560
expected so i'll never know why i can only speculate um i mean do you have any speculation

692
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,960
well first of all are you are you do you like do you care like it does this affect you in any way

693
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:36,560
i mean this was not a person who i was highly invested in right however the the only reason

694
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,320
that i do care a little bit is that i kind of went into this feeling like i was kind of settling

695
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:54,400
right but i didn't like it was fine but i was kind of like i guess i guess um but then right

696
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,480
but then you know we met up in person and i was fine with her but she apparently found me

697
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:06,640
unacceptable for whatever reason and i feel you know i feel judged you know i feel like

698
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:13,920
someone who's someone who i didn't value very highly looked at me and was like no thanks and i'm

699
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:23,200
like huh what's what's you know you know what i mean so it's like your expectations of other people

700
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:29,360
and others are not the same like others of you so it's like you know like people who you think

701
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:36,080
aren't very good like look at you and think he's really not good so it's like you feel like i don't

702
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:44,400
know your standards are too high no uh it's just uh you know it's just like uh well shit man

703
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,880
you know what's wrong with me you know what what what what's uh what am i missing you know what

704
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:59,600
what's the problem you know what is the problem did you think did you find out no i told you i was

705
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:05,520
unmatched so you know i can't well how would i know do you have a speculation did the phantom

706
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,560
tell you i have a couple of guesses you know i i bet she went home with the phantom afterward

707
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:17,360
actually he's caught by the phantom yeah yeah um i have i have appears general store affordable

708
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:24,800
size 24 backpack oh fuck yeah so i have a couple of speculations oh wait wait joe jamart no fuck

709
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,960
oh i'd like to remind you are drilling operations entirely legal responsible stewardship of the

710
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:35,680
local enviroments of top priority i can't believe you showed her that i can't believe it didn't work

711
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:44,320
i know right what a what a what a downer so um i have a couple of speculations one she was a cat

712
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:52,080
person i said i'm not a pet person she said you know that's a sign of a sociopath and i said what

713
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:59,440
like can't and she and and she's like i mean she was kind of grinning so she might have been

714
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:05,280
joking but still like the fact that she said it is all at all i found it strange she was like

715
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,720
you know that's rat poison right yeah you know you know that's rat poison she she was like um

716
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:18,560
um yeah like you can not own a pet but you should at least be like oh i wish i had a dog and i'm

717
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:26,720
like what no and she's like yeah that's a sign of a sociopath tell me when you see a squirrel

718
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:31,440
when you see a squirrel on the road like when you pass a squirrel do you think about like

719
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:37,600
what's inside it and how you can get it out and i'm like what no and she's like okay

720
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,960
she's like well whoa wait what does she mean what's inside like like like that's not what she said

721
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:51,520
squirrels yeah she's like do you think about disemboweling squirrels and i'm like no and and she's

722
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:59,360
like okay i was a forensic psych major by the way and i'm like yeah all right sure i can tell yeah

723
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:06,640
it really shows and not necessarily in a good way um it's just i have a sociopath you know

724
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:14,080
oh yeah i'm not a dog person i like to watch squirrels get disemboweled though yeah pretty much

725
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:19,840
so so so that so that so i don't know if maybe she thought something about that i think more like

726
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:26,160
like i was joking about how small my room is right i was joking about like haha yeah it's basically

727
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:32,640
a closet i think she might have like believed me you know like and also like i told her that like

728
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,840
okay she definitely didn't like that i have uh housemates which fair you know i'm not even

729
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,880
gonna say they're like oh what the fuck it's fine like no whatever that that makes sense i get it um

730
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,600
so it might have been it might have been that she didn't want to come in here while there's like

731
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,720
other people live here you know i mean there wouldn't be like i mean they'd be in like separate rooms

732
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:01,040
but like yeah that's fair um maybe she didn't like maybe she thought oh this guy you know he's a

733
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,160
procast bitch and he's got you know his his room he lives in a closet you know no thanks

734
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:13,840
that while not true really you know if she believed that it's like well all right fair or it might

735
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:21,680
have been the dog sociopath thing probably not but you never know um yeah those are my spec

736
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:28,480
those are my speculations on the matter does does this like dissuade you from trying gender

737
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,800
or is this just like a blip on the radar and like you know i mean it was a little bit disappointing

738
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,760
i tried to give it but like i mean it was a little bit disappointing and it hurt my pride just a

739
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:46,240
little bit but like you know whatever uh that's that's that's what happens right that's that's

740
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:54,400
that's what that's well that well mark that's life to quote did a man after reciting your mini

741
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:01,280
past been uh trifles with with with the other gender yeah the lesser gender you mean yeah yeah

742
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:07,200
the lesser gender yeah uh are you trying like like this is i mean i don't know how often you

743
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:12,720
go on tinder but i've never heard of you going on a tinder date uh i um i tried to reconnect with

744
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:18,000
i went on i was on like before i moved in with digi like when i was living here at monkey house um

745
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:25,840
we'll have before i moved in with digi i was well i hadn't been for like when i when i moved in here

746
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:31,600
i was on tinder pretty a lot um i was doing a bunch of at some point i kind of like got sick of it

747
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:37,760
was like whatever uh and i stopped for a while and then in virginia beach it just didn't work

748
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,120
like there were no responses like they like i never got any matches because like nobody was

749
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:50,400
using it in tinder or whatever funny story okay i thought that like living near boston you would

750
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,840
get a ton of matches and that's kind of true however the matches that i get they don't come from

751
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:02,720
boston like never like nobody in boston is tinder it's all girls from salem like every single one

752
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:10,400
of them is a girl from salem i see and i don't get it i just don't fucking get it maybe when

753
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:19,040
you're in the city you don't like need tender uh maybe yeah maybe maybe it's like if you if you're

754
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,720
the kind of person who would use tender you are and you're in the city you would already be meeting

755
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:31,440
other people outside of the app so you would have no need for like a secondary source um person who

756
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,440
would need yeah like you know if you're like in a like a smaller town you know you're not gonna

757
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,080
meet as many people you'd be interested in oh wait wait for my return on the dawn of your third

787
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:31,920
stcomics.com rereading the the white lion and uh i went to the about page and there's a a surreal

788
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,800
moment when i when i read that brunswick and the champion both came out in 2016

789
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:47,200
that feels like wait what what what what did brunswick and the champion the champion did not

790
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:57,440
come out in 2016 that's what that's what's on the website um that's impossible well i i thought it

793
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:27,680
like early 2018 or like mid mid to late 2018 or something uh yeah i mean yeah it's a long time

794
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:38,960
fuck obviously no judgment i'm no better but would you say you're i mean i mean do you have

795
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,880
any like priorities or are you just trying to like like is there any methodology to this or are you

796
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:50,080
just uh trying to do things harder no there's no methodology i'm just trying to do things harder

797
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:56,400
and i feel like it's working not like wait and many people stay indoors on days like this is not

829
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,200

830
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,360
this is your more thoughtful maybe that's where i've asked well i mean maybe because i

833
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:23,200
notes right tbap was there would occasionally be a scripted bit in it uh it was mostly off the cuff

834
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:28,960
occasionally there'd be a scripted bit and there were notes we would take notes and we would hit

835

they my portfolio is good and they said quote you've got a shot you've got a shot i mean i feel

879
01:39:53,040 --> 01:40:00,480
like if you talk to someone and told them about endless war they'd be like what i don't know

880
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:06,880
endless war seems like a really impressive thing to me uh well for a shitty kid such as yourself

881
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,080
in the portfolio you have an image and then you have like a title and description and in

882
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:18,480
said description i mentioned endless war okay well good it bears it bears mentioning yeah i i also

883
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:27,040
have it in my resume as programmed a computer game which is quite a lot of sort of sort of

884
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,360
doesn't sound as impressive when you say it like that you think so i thought that sounded more

885
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:36,880
impressive how would you how would you at most impressively describe it i mean the impressive

886
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:43,040
part about endless war wait oh fuck that was a bad item the impressive part about endless war is not

887
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,840
that a game was programmed it's that a game was programmed and it's a masterpiece and everyone

888
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:57,520
loves it yeah okay and that like you know there's a community around it you know that that's

921
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:01,040

01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:08,880
yeah we got swept up by big iron um um i i i submitted to college yeah it feels good

923
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,840
now my plate's clean finally actually actually it's clean for a moment or two but now it's

924
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,920
going to be completely dominated by commissions again so i guess uh for all the new purposes

925
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,480
i'm still away on how it is commissions are great by the way they're really fun

926
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:31,600
why can't they're talk they're really useful uh to motivate you to draw every day because you

927
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:39,200
have to because there's money on the line you see yeah i guess uh yeah i mean they did get me to draw

928
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:47,280
um at times oh shit that reminds me a guy was like tentatively going to commission me

929
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:54,080
and i think that he thought that i didn't want to take it but i like did a sketch and like sent

930
01:45:54,080 --> 01:46:00,160
him the sketch like two days ago or something and i don't know if he responded so i should check if

931
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:06,640
he responded i should check and find out if he responded he was gonna he was like he was like

932
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:13,840
hey yeah i'll pay you know i don't know how hard this is i'll pay like my budget is maybe 50 to

933
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:22,240
150 dollars for it that's a big budget yeah so you know i'm tempted you know part of me is like

934
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:29,200
this guy's willing to pay 150 dollars everything in line everything is worth what people will pay for

935
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:36,480
it and no more and no less so i should charge him 150 dollars but i don't think i don't think i can

936
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,840
justify it because i don't feel like it's a hundred and fifty dollar job it's not that hard what is it

937
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:51,280
he just he wanted me to draw like an icon for him oh what like um like yeah like a like a pro like

938
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:59,040

939
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:08,560

940
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:18,320
it costs ten dollars yeah true but hey i walk out with a cool crisp ten dollars that that paid for

946
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:06,640
it's a recipe i don't need new friends do you ever draw without like like non-comic work

947
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:15,760
almost never how often would you say you draw basically basically only when i'm drawing a

948
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:23,840
comic well no okay you know i mean i drew that clefable thing the other day just like when i get

949
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:33,760
an idea for something and or i mean you know i used to draw every day i don't think i draw every

950
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:42,880
day anymore but like probably most days or maybe i mean not less than half i don't think

951
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:52,320
man i should draw every day again wait wait so you you draw mostly every week no most most days

952

954
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:09,440

957
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,960
you don't draw almost never but you draw almost every day

958
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:39,200

1016
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:39,520

1017
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:48,320
what's it called i don't want to say wait why i don't know i it's it's sort of weird i don't

1019
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:02,880
said yeah i got a g ed or yeah i got a phd or yeah i got you know such and such qualification

1020
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:09,200
that's not that's not doxing yourself is it is that is this like is like knowing what did what

1021
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:15,200
qualification you have like an identifying piece of information no but this is less of a general

1022
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,240
diploma and it's more i imagine it's a way smaller group of people it's not like it's it's like it's

1023
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:34,640
like a private thing that i've gotten uh all right fair fair enough i guess but anyway yeah i uh i got

1024
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:40,960
that quite a while ago and so now i've for a while i was just like well this is my life now uh but then

1025
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:48,160
but then like like six months i started seriously considering college now here i am uh the last thing

1026
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:56,000
i did to do college was an essay and i had everyone review it and it was nice if you if you were in

1027
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,680
the endless war homework server then then you know what i'm talking about god bless the homework

1028
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:12,480
hey so um so again i don't want to give any details on this but we got i got the uh i got the secret

1029
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:18,960
project being worked on by my by my slaves in the in the slime dungeon in saint ben's cathedral

1030
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:26,560
and man i don't i'm not i'm not complaining about this i'm just it's just an observation

1031
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,840
um i'm looking at the stuff people have written because it's a writing thing people are contributing

1032
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:40,480
like bits of writing to the game and it's very frustrating not because it's bad or anything

1033
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:47,680
but every single thing that someone writes i read it and i'm just like i would have worded this

1034
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:53,520
in such and such way you know like i would have worded this differently and i want to change it

1035
01:58:53,600 --> 01:59:02,800
even though it's not wrong you know uh well i mean why can't you i might i might just do that i

1036
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:08,560
can i can do it is the i mean it it's it's easier to write than it is you're still saving time it's

1037
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,840
not like you're you know there's no point to having to be community outsourced then i guess you lose

1038
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:19,040
i mean i guess you do lose the the conception of like wow get your work in the game like get

1039
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,600
yeah in the game that will be i don't i don't want to do too much of that

1040
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:27,360
i don't want to do too much rewriting i don't want to do any more than i need to

1041
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:33,280
i mean i will do i definitely will do some hey no i wanted to give you my fucking fish

1042
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:37,280
i just missed him i just missed him take my fish

1043
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:48,400
alas well i mean it that's it's sort of a good thing to change it i mean rewrite it i mean

1044
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:54,240
to make like to make like the tone of it consistent exactly i mean that's how you make a consistent

1045
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:03,600
you know uh voice yeah i mean i definitely will do some i you know i like i want to preserve the

1046
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:10,960
community aspect of it like i want to keep the like yeah players you know the players came together

1047
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:20,480
to work on implementing this feature um so you know i like that part of it but you know i want

1048
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:26,480
the tone to be consistent and you know i just want to i will probably go in and just oh look at all

1049
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:32,800
these fucking look at all these hanging participles and and you know uh sentence and ended with the

1050
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:39,520
preposition or you know whatever nitpick shit that might bug me that would have

1051
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:47,040
obviously you have to be like grammar and fucking shit like that yeah it's it's mostly fine um but

1052
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:51,360
you know there's there's always something there's always something there was a there was a there was a

1053
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:59,280

1054
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:06,800
improper improper pronoun usage um there was a big push to go back over everything you've made and uh

1055
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:13,120
do some uh it doesn't reference any particular genders do some do some do some do some pronoun

1091
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:20,160
very foundation of of my interpretation of events it just like disintegrates tom is like like like a

1092
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:27,680
joyous soul who is like enjoys my company and like expresses it and like i can't believe it

1098
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:04,640

1107
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:10,080
i don't know of cynical behavior you know yeah criticizing everything yeah yeah

1108
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:18,160
it sucks yeah it's lame it's lame as hell so that's what i enjoy when i when i

1109
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:26,080
tom hippo you you guys are are i would consider probably my best friends i remember i remember

1110
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:29,840
we had we had like a like a like a weird confrontation i feel like i used the term

1111
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:36,000
best friend more flexible than you and i remember that you felt really ashamed that like like you

1112
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:42,240
were like uh we discussed best friends and i was like yeah like vince vince oh that like it was it

1113
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:48,080
was it that was it that like i felt that i couldn't categorically i couldn't categorically place you

1114
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:54,080
as like a definitive number one over and above all others and i was like i'm so sorry yeah yeah

1115
02:07:54,080 --> 02:08:03,120
i was like i don't care yeah yeah not a big deal yeah uh let's well meet for me personally

1116
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,680
it makes me fucking pissed that you won't definitively place me over and above all

1117
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,120
others so are you really no i'm no i'm joking please please know that i'm joking when i say

1118
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:21,520
okay all right i'm i'm really fucking mad right now um just just just to warn you i'm on the war

1119
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:27,120
path that that was that was the sort of thing where i couldn't like completely outrule that that

1120
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:31,520
would be real i didn't expect it to be true but munchie that's such a horrible thing to say

1121
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:43,680
how could you think i meant it well you know oh god oh i'm out well no it's it's sort of like you

1122
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:49,040
know it's one it's one of those things that you you think and you don't want to say to other people

1123
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,840
but i mean ben just says ben's an honest man

1124
02:08:54,400 --> 02:09:02,160
but he had always told the truth that he was an honest man and brandy does

1125
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:07,520
look at the man in the mirror to understand something make a change

1126
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:14,800
take a look at yourself and make a change if you want to make the world you know you know

1127
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:21,360
you ever heard of a guy named michael jackson uh i don't know if i told this on stream or anything

1128
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:27,360
oh my mom soggy newspaper whoa do read it okay i don't think this is trash

1129
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:38,480
nice no bones about it unironically asked me uh in in full sincerity well do do kids

1130
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:43,760
do kids these days know about the holocaust and about nazis that's a fair question

1131
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:50,800
why no that's not if what are you joking no well look i mean i know that the answer is yes

1132
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:56,960
but i mean imagine you're not in school you don't you don't know any kids you don't talk to kids

1133
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:03,440
how would you know how would you know that the way you know is that like do you know about things

1134
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:08,720
from your past like do you know things like or rather do you know about events that have

1135
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:12,720
happened in the past before you were alive like does my mom know about abraham lincoln

1136
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:19,520
did you know what the silver wars i mean yes so obviously a big event will be remembered

1137
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:24,000
it will be remembered but like i mean until war two was before her time okay well i mean

1138
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:30,880
my grandpa fought in the korean war i don't know almost anything about the korean war

1139
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:36,880
and that's like that's more recent than the holocaust uh well first of all very slightly

1140
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:44,640
more recent yeah like that sure but but still you know i couldn't tell you very much about the korean

1141
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:54,480
war um well i feel like even at time it's cool i mean i don't think anyone was under the impression

1142
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:58,720
well okay specifically with the korean war i feel like maybe some people thought that it might turn

1143
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:04,960
into another global conflict but like even just like a few years out it was clear that was not the

1144
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:10,960
case and the korean war was not indeed another like you know turning point in american history

1145
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,600
like world war two i feel it's clear there's a difference of scale there that could ease i mean

1146
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:25,520
i mean even the fact that like surely there's like you are aware that there's a complete over

1147
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:32,160
saturation of media about world war two that's true um clearly you are aware that it is a big deal

1148
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:37,600
to at least like you know moviegoers or you know what yeah yeah there's yeah there's there's so many

1149
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:42,800
world there's so many world war two movies there's so many holocaust movies i mean yeah like obviously

1150
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:49,760
the answer is yes i'm just saying i understand i can understand where the where the question comes

1151
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:55,760
from if it were a lesser event if it was the korean war if i said like do you know about the

1152
02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:04,080
korean war i i would have it would have been yes we do my my dad my dad once uh he was there was a

1153
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:10,640
time when he was unbelievably condescending to my sister my sister was maybe like 18 at the time

1154
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:18,320
and he this is so but this makes me a little mad just thinking about it we were i don't remember

1155
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:25,120
we were sitting at the dinner table the conversation referenced like we mentioned like hitler we mentioned

1156
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:33,920
um uh mao mao zidang uh kim jung un or whatever you know we're talking about like dictators and

1157
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,800
and stuff and you know we're we're talking about this we're saying whatever it is and my dad like

1158
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:47,600
leans over to my sister i can't believe this man he's like by the way he says to to my adult sister

1159
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:59,600
he says by the way these are all very bad men uh doesn't it make you feel icky i mean was it was

1160
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:08,800
it a joke no no i get the impression that yeah i mean i wouldn't imagine that it is but like

1161
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:15,680
it feels like there's no way it couldn't be yeah no i get that and yet and yet here we are

1162
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:21,920
uh have i talked about have i talked about my

1163
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:30,960
oh i want this chest oh god i need this fish sorry no the fish

1164
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:39,440
okay okay have i talked about my a guy who lived here in monkey house briefly a guy named a chinese

1165
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:46,240
kid named jerry who uh didn't know who elvis was uh you talked to me about this many times but uh

1166
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:52,000
he didn't know who elvis was you didn't know like my my downstairs we don't have downstairs

1167
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:58,720
neighbors anymore but at the time we had downstairs neighbors and their like grandma or something was

1168
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:03,600
like turning 90 and on her 90th birthday they had a party in the backyard and they had an elvis

1169
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:12,080
impersonator and jerry didn't know who elvis was now i wondered you know do maybe in china

1170
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:18,000
elvis isn't as famous as he is here but i don't believe that elvis is like so big elvis is like

1171
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:25,120
transit you know who the beetles are yeah pretty much um everybody knows him right i'm sure of it

1172
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:30,720
i'm sure they know elvis in china oh a new record um but it doesn't even matter because it was just

1173
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:36,560
like ethically chinese who was born there right well he grew up in america he uh half and half

1174
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:42,480
yeah like he had spent enough time in america that no that's not that can't even be the reason um

1175
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:50,560
he's just a fucking zoomer who doesn't know who fucking elvis is i don't even like elvis i don't

1176
02:14:50,560 --> 02:15:00,640

1182
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:39,360
to like point that fact out i i mean like i like you know there was a ton of other there was a gaggle

1191
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:47,520
sorry what uh i was just talking about the fact i met dweeb yeah uh you were the phantom machine

1192
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:54,400
that night that was at your house well not by choice you guys kept bullying me to do it yeah

1193
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:59,200
you you you couldn't i mean you you you were the only one with a vape you're the only one that

1194
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:06,400
could do it sure sure but you you just you just you just kept wanting to see it you just wanted

1195
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:12,800
more and more you just take and take and take well whenever we met a new person i i made been

1196
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:21,520
reveal the phantom yeah yeah person and it like for some reason like the universe inspired against

1197
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:25,920
us because like every single new person like this is a person who had never seen it before and just

1198
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:31,440
by chance their reaction was less and less thrilling each time like at the end i think the last

1199
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:38,560
person we we did is that is that is it so surprising well is it so shocking i would imagine like like a

1200
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:44,480
new text a new test subject each time would be just as thrilled as last but you know no communication

1201
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:49,360
you know maybe our energy level was going to maybe we were less and less enthused about it and maybe

1202
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:54,960
that you know carried over into their reaction maybe is isaac the guy who's playing persona five

1203
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:02,800
lucas lucas lucas the guy the guy with the the ghosts the guy oh was that the ghost that was

1204
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:10,880
that was well that yeah he was the guy who was like let's do the seance for ghost reasons uh

1205
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:16,560
anyway we showed it to him and and his reaction was just uh like like uh like uh

1206
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:27,680
well that's well that's lucas okay okay yeah yeah good stuff good stuff good yeah great work

1207
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:29,840
and it was

1208
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,160
is there anyone you can make the holes disappear

1209
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:41,280
why can't uh they i think they just disappear on their own after a while if nothing's planted

1210
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:47,760
in them right do you want you want it nice and clean yeah i do yeah i do too no once you dig a

1211
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:53,760
hole you just gotta like what let it fuck it's you're just you're just fucked

1212
02:18:56,560 --> 02:19:02,640
jesus my life's not gonna like this oh my god you're gonna die i'm starting shit i'm starting

1213
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:08,560

1214
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:15,280
can't eat food to regain energy uh i could but i don't have any food well i guess i have this

1252
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:39,760
after being in boston why because do you miss me do you just miss me that much uh bitch yeah

1253
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:46,720
sure let's go with that yeah yeah yeah yeah when i'm in boston i feel like my life is progressing

1254
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:52,240
i feel like i'm accomplishing things and i'm and i'm getting work done especially this trip

1255
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,920
times before it's been like you know i'm on vacation you know i'm just sort of seeing the

1256
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:02,560
sites and having fun hanging out and uh you know wasn't really getting a lot of work done but

1257
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:07,280
especially this time like i'm uh like i like i actually i mean i was on that computer i i could

1258
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:12,240
do i i mean i edited the drawcast there before it's a podcast there and a whole bunch of stuff

1259
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:16,240
especially after that since i was there for such a long time i didn't afford not to so it really

1260
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:23,440
felt like wow it sure feels great to live in a city that i enjoy and be able to you know meet my

1261
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:29,200
friends on a reasonable basis and be able to you know go into the city and you know hang out there

1262
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:36,240
and now it like it felt like wow sure feels great to live here uh and then uh you know i was there

1263
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:40,880
for like a month and a half and now i'm back here it feels like wow all my progress has just been

1264
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:46,800
undone like i like i'm i'm right back at square one and now i am toiling away in the mines wasting

1265
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:54,080
away and just counting the days until i can go back that's how it feels oh it's fun now i'm exhausted

1266
02:24:54,080 --> 02:25:01,520
again like help um um well well you're coming back in like a month right yeah so it's not too long

1267
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:09,920
it just it sucks and i hate it there's only a few more trips before it is actually well i mean

1268
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:16,160
if everything goes play in only a few more trips are you going to sleep right now at 11 um i i can

1269
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:24,720
barely move okay holy shit yeah i fucked up i shouldn't have i shouldn't have chopped that last

1270
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:30,640
tree i could have let i could have like walked to the pier and like uh oh great i could have like

1271
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:35,360
walked to the pier and gone fishing and made some money but uh you know i fucked up fucked it up

1272
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:41,200
what's happening right now i'm getting a fucking dog

1273
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:50,080
i was just thinking because i saw it's that little dog bowl up in the top left there and

1274
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:55,600
i was like when's that dog coming turns out right now don't you think don't you think this farm

1275
02:25:55,600 --> 02:26:00,160
could use a good dog no oh my god like you can decline you can decline

1276
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:04,960
yeah but would but would jenny the juvie decline

1277
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:14,400
hmm well i feel like jenny the juvie doesn't have good wits about him so he'd probably accept the

1278
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:20,560
dog no matter how much maintenance he had to do it yeah i think jen i think i think the juvie move

1279
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:25,920
is to adopt the dog and since this isn't a role-playing experience i'm gonna do it however

1280
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:35,920
let me make my objections very clear what's open yeah uh slime field it's slime field

1281
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:44,000
i don't know but i'm not i'm not particularly invincible we were in that pet store together

1282
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:50,720
you uh you you went out some some strange expressions i've never seen you make before

1283
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:56,160
dogs are cute puppies are cute don't get me wrong they are i don't want one

1284
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:03,440
but they're nice to look at from time to time do you do oh oh oh

1285
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:09,280
huh say when someone else when you're at someone else's house or even just you're out for a walk

1286
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:16,160
and you see a dog what's what's your uh it's generally positive okay it's a generally positive

1287
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:27,200
reaction to dogs you know i i get it i get dogs i get the appeal i do but like fuck it

1288
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:34,960
fuck it no no thanks i mean there would be there would be there would be literally no room for

1289
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:40,720
a dog for you so it's not like it would be even be possible yeah that's true even even on a desirable

1290
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:48,720
apparently um there used to be a guy that lived here briefly named conrad not oh no a different

1291
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:55,840
conrad i doubt it and he uh he kept a cat here apparently and everyone hated it it was like well

1292
02:27:55,840 --> 02:28:04,800
sure yeah i mean it's a pet in the in a shared space unless it's like a really good pet like yeah

1293
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:10,640
yeah i mean we take well like our downstairs neighbors moved out we used to pets it their dog

1294
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:17,360
they had a a very sweet dog named mabel mabel was a pretty good dog but you know she was a hassle

1295
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:23,680
and like she like peed on our stairs a couple of times that's not good yeah actually only i think

1296
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,760
that only happened once like one time she just like they dropped her off and she immediately

1297
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:37,840
just pissed on our front stairs like inside but you know that's life sometimes in life you just

1298
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:45,760
gotta fucking piss on the ground shit i should have watered these like less mature plants first

1299
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:53,440
oh no this is such a bummer i need to eat something i need to eat something like right now

1300
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:58,640
you like all your life is just like waking up watering these plants and going to bed

1301
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:07,840
exclamation point toil yeah exactly i don't i don't even have any money to buy food

1302
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:14,880
jesus christ i can't can i eat the sap can i eat the sap in my inventory how do you get more money

1303
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:18,800
well selling selling crops mainly okay

1304
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:26,960
okay it's okay it's early in the morning so i can go fish i don't think fishing takes energy

1305
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:34,080
so uh i can just go fish and maybe make some money that way maybe i can buy some food you wake up

1306
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:40,960
you're immediately exhausted because all i want is just to like i just want to finish watering my

1307
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:46,240
fucking crops so they all like grow in at the at you know as close to the same time as possible

1308
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:54,160
i guess it doesn't matter that much because i mean i've obviously i've planted too much

1309
02:29:54,160 --> 02:30:01,120
and i can't water at all so like you know it doesn't all need to come in at once anyway

1310
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:06,640
but hey that's just a theory a game theory

1311
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:10,960
huh how much coin does it take to play the arcade game

1312
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,480
i'm not sure it costs any money i think you know what we're doing

1313
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:25,520
no no not big iron look there's important shit to do what could be more important than big iron

1314
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,280
seaweed seaweed's not important

1315
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:37,520
wait no i have to i have to eat it no i had to eat that seaweed no

1316
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:45,600
the seaweed keto yeah i think so

1317
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:54,320
uh do i need this sap do i need damn it but by the way last night in the pc in the conversation

1318
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:59,360
we had over text you said that you were back on keto you did you ever leave i got off it for the

1319
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:06,800
holidays okay um but i mean was that like an intentional like leave like like you you said

1320
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:12,800
to yourself i'm not gonna be on keto for a while yeah for like a week i was oh shit no i'm sluggish

1321
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:20,320
from over exhaustion i'm fucked i'm fucked i'm gonna die munchy i'm going to die no don't worry

1322
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:28,800
just get a fish i can't do it i can't do it oh oh my god okay can you eat anything

1323
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,640
i could have eaten that seaweed but i didn't have room in my inventory for it

1324
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:41,040
that seaweed was my lifeline can you panhandle for money no

1325
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:41,620
no

1326
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:49,120
god i can't i can't let anyone see me i can't let any of my perspective boyfriends and or

1327
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:56,400
girlfriends see me like this better walk into town and collapse in the middle um well during

1328
02:31:56,400 --> 02:32:03,200
this long walk home i'll get to appreciate jenny the juvie i just love jenny the juvie

1329
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:08,480
i just love jenny the juvie so much i'm loving him more every moment

1330
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:16,080
he's got good style he does i mean i mean he has the oculus rift on he's probably not

1331
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:20,080
even paying attention to what he's doing no he doesn't he he doesn't even know he's a farmer

1332
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:27,280
yeah he thinks he's a badass action hero and wherever he plants me down he's bringing someone

1333
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:29,760
skull in he thinks he's a space marine

1334
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:43,120
you are you are in my heart jenny jenny juvie first name jenny last name juvie are these cows yours

1335
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:51,360
no these belong to um what's her name down there the girl who gave me the dog or woman rather

1336
02:32:51,520 --> 02:33:00,640
man i'm going a long way take the long way home take the long way home let's you know let's just

1337
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:04,960
fill the rest of the episode with like saying something and then singing a song that whatever

1338
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:13,200
we just said reminds us of sounds like a great idea that's how i feel time i don't know about you

1339
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:20,720
fucks gotta fill up my water and can uh hey what time is it how much longer how much longer do we

1340
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:29,040
have it's i i have like 10 minutes really okay yeah i mean we've i feel like we covered some good

1341
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:39,200
ground we covered some ground today i feel like ground was stepped upon uh-huh but not covered

1342
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:49,200
no i feel like it's it's like a splatoon map and we did like 60 of it uh i don't know like

1343
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,800
is there more is there more you wish we'd gone into

1344
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:03,600
maybe i feel like we could have gone more in depth about any number of the things we talked about

1345
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:07,600
but i mean i mean i guess it's just not the way the conversation developed there's a way in your

1346
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:12,400
head you expect conversations to go but they hardly ever pan out the way you do that you expect them

1347
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:20,640
to well hey man um we should take this as an opportunity to reflect we should reflect on all

1348
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:28,160
on all the things we discussed today and think about we should do another one soon right yeah

1349
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:34,880
no i don't know uh i i'm i'm i'm a big proponent of the idea that we don't have to do rf2k is

1350
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:42,880
so close together i know i know the game the game of youtube and the game of twitch is the

1351
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:48,880
release regularly i know we do weekly streams but honestly i don't think we have to i think

1352
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,600
that's part of what makes them special is that they're an event and also that no one gets burned

1353
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:58,080
out no one gets burned out of rf2k you know you can get burned out of endless war since it's an

1354
02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:02,720
ongoing game but like no one's ever going to think like oh fucking man they've just like

1355
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:06,560
run out of things to say well actually everyone thinks that every single episode yeah no one will

1356
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:13,200
think i've heard too much you know like i like oh like jesus christ let it in really like game

1357
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,800
grumps at least a video every day where they said let's play every day eventually you're gonna

1358
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:22,480
loop conversation eventually you're going to like you know like actually really have nothing to say

1359
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:27,360
and it will just be game commentary of over and over again which is not anything that i want to

1360
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:33,440
me personally me personally more than happy to just comment about how my farm is

1361
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:40,560
i'm ready to turn this into an immersive role playing experience i'm ready to develop the

1362
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:46,800
narrative of jenny the juvie uh well uh it seems like everything's already pre-decided for you

1363
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:51,440
i mean you didn't decide to get a dog it just like a dog just appeared on your doorstep like you know

1364
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:56,320
i mean how much role playing can happen that isn't already predetermined by the game

1365
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:05,120
well you know i gotta choose my my cutie my cutie gf slash bf um i gotta choose what i gotta choose

1366
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:11,680
what crops to grow you know i got i want to grow that killer flower why are you just intentionally

1367
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:17,200
leaving some some crops i can't pick them because my inventory is full and i'm pretty sure the reason

1368
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:23,440
for that is that they are like uh special they're like silver parts like they're higher quality so

1369
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:27,680
they count as a different item so i'll just have to get them uh in a second

1370
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:34,640
i'll have i'll have to come here we go now oh wait no first i gotta water my cauliflower
