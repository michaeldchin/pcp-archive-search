1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All right, two partner, uh, who's on top, who's on bottom?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Lighters are getting the fattest from the bottom.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's not tough, that's not tough.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All right, and if you had to make an episode about Applebloom going to hell, what would it be?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What would that absolute progression be like?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Would it be like that time Homer went to hell and had to eat all the doughnuts?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I saw our parents applejack!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All right, guys.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Looks like we're all done, guys. We're all done.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They turn off the mic.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, hey, everypony. Welcome to a very special episode of My Little Pony, Thoroughly Analyzing.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm joined by all my best friends in the whole wide world.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We've got best guy ever, also known as kegstandard.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know who the fuck that first guy is, I'm kegstandard.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And welcome to another episode of TBBBAP. Take it, Phantom!

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's two best brothers bitch about ponies. It's me, your blue bitch here, Phantom Horne.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The only pony with the courage to defy social norms, ever.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've got that.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's all you gotta say.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is that give and take over there?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, guys, welcome to ArmourTreeVul Act 7.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're gonna be talking about homestuck today.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's a banned topic. You know that.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Trigger word.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh my god! Brody Curious is here!

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I even look back! I did it!

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm alive!

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yay!

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hi.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No longer a zombie.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, I've been revived.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm glad to see everyone survived the whole cutie mark revival.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Have you been max revived?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We've all been max revived.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We've got the mage pony.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, Aurora Ignite.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, that's the full name.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I knew that.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a failure.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We've got the munchie with the tiny hats.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know who that guy is, cause let me tell you.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, PCP fans, he's the most recently acquainted best friend, Strawberry Milk.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah!

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Woven expertly into the grand tapestry.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That is my little pony, Fringe of Magic Analysis Community.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you know what I'm saying, real cliff notes on my lore.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I love sex. I'm not like munchie. I love sex. I like the ERP.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I do.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a toon fetishist, and I hate shame, and I hate self-reflection.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just love sex. That's my character.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't wear it out.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're peas in a pod.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We've even got a brand new friend joining us for the first time.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Our new friend, Tape Stack.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey, everybody. I predicted that this would be great.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you have tape in your mouth?

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was going to say.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, I just don't.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm racist at all.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Excellent.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You see, we're appealing to all fetishes here.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm really into that.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm getting ready. I'm getting lewd.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The gang is all here, buddy.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, unfortunately, our seafaring buddy, Starboard Bow,

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
was busy off pirating today, so he couldn't join us,

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but we will pour one out in his name.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Gotta get the booty.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Exactly.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Guys, guys, have you seen it? Have you seen it?

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Have you seen the long-awaited fucking pony movie?

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The cinematic events of all time,

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
of all the equestrian history.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Guys, let me tell you.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I walked outside one graceful night,

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and I looked up in the stars,

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and there was the solar eclipse

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
beaming down directly into my eyes.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And from that day onward, all I could see,

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
just directly into my red nose,

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
was the My Little Pony movie on repeat,

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
as thin as them.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's exactly why you should stare at the eclipse.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know?

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Because you get quality semina right in your brain.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, I've never really had

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
a religious experience in a religious place,

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
but while sitting on my couch,

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
watching the My Little Pony movie,

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I briefly saw God.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you, Brony?

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was just wonderful to hear you say that.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I briefly saw God, too. All three of them,

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
before they were turned to stone.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You mean all four?

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You mean all four?

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can see you're rusty out here, Brony Curious,

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but let's try and get up to speed, all right?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're not running a shit show here.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This isn't like some bum-fuck internet pocket.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's like the PCP.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is...

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's better.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Get over it, you anti-Hazbright.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is the PPCP,

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the Pony Procrastination Podcast.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's an alternate reality.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's the darkest timeline.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, it's the brightest from where I'm standing.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So, okay.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So let's just immediately dive into all the earth-shattering ways

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
this movie ruined the continuity

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
of My Little Pony Friends was imagined.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Should we go through it in order to chronologically

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
like the best internet shows and nostalgia critic?

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, hold on.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go to where...

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think it's important because this movie

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is so fucking earth-shattering,

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and it just plumped us up.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It just plumped us up real good.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It just saddled us up and plumped us down real good.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, everybody.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As the creator of the My Little Pony analysis community,

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I feel like I could lead this discussion

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
of the My Little Pony.

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wait, should we talk about our history first,

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
or is that whatever?

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to talk about our history

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and the movie all at once here

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because I want to know who else watching this movie.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
First of all, actually, more so than our history,

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want to know when was the last time

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
each of you watched My Little Pony.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know Hippo follows the show still.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I literally haven't watched a full episode

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
since I stopped analyzing the show in 2014.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I watched, like, one episode from season 5.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait, that's not true. I watched a bunch from season 5.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait, Ben, didn't you watch all of season 5

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and T-Bap it?

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, we podcasted it.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait, you did the whole season 5.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, maybe I'm thinking of season 6 then.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Season 7 is out now, right?

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Season 6 is the one that...

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, then I stopped watching after the podcast ended,

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but I watched, like, one...

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think I watched the finale of the next season

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
just to see if I was interested.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I keep forgetting I did watch half of season 5

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
before we went to BronyCon in 2015

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
just because I wanted to know what the fuck was going on.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I watched a couple episodes, I think, from season 6

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because I foolishly made a list

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
of, like, four episodes I had to review

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
if big things ever happened,

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and then I did some of them because I kept happening.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I got pestered on it on Twitter.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was like, well, I guess I'll have to talk about them,

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so I did.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I stopped watching right around

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the midway point of season 5 weekly.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
However, me and Phantom here

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
actually watched a few episodes of season 6 together,

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and we should have been basically.

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait, we did?

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, we did.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Remember when we were going to do a thing, but we never...

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Remember when we were going to literally do T-Bap,

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but it never happened?

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, God, that was, like, forever ago.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's when I watched season 6.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What the fuck? I don't remember any of it.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Um, if I recall correctly, you almost cried

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
in an episode?

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Which one? Which one?

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What the fuck?

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The second episode of season 6,

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
you were like, that's really deep moral,

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and I almost cried.

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Wait, wait, what happened? Tell me what happened,

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because I'm starting to...

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Nobody actually cares.

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm starting to form into memory.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Damn it.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's like, I should listen to my friends.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What the fuck? No.

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That can't be right.

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, let's get back to this.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I haven't seen anything since season 5.

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, yeah.

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, that was the one where the evil,

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
where the evil got in her and made her be bad,

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and I related to it.

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, shit.

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
God, I forgot.

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I forgot this was the best show on the internet.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mange.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mange, what was the last time you watched

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
a new episode of My Little Pony?

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Um, I'm actually up to date.

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who?

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, shit.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're up there with hippo.

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Number one.

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She's a realer pony than any of us.

213
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not actually up to date,

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because, um, the pony cast,

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we've been having a bit of, like, seasick,

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
like, cancer, like, what do you call it,

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
scurvy, I see that.

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sea-sick cancer.

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We have some sort of scurvy problem,

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so we haven't been able to do any of those episodes

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
for a while.

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So I'm behind on that.

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But I, yeah, season 7 is good.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I like season 7.

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, here's the thing with season 7.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you haven't watched the pony cast,

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we discover that season 6 and season 5,

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
they're like, oh, whatever.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then season 7,

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
they start introducing a new main cast,

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
sort of.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Like, that's, like, that good,

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that good-

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have been,

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I will say that I have been watching the pony cast,

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and that's the only way,

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
it's been really surreal listening to that podcast,

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
because I can envision the episodes in my head.

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Like, even though it's been so long

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
since I watched the show,

242
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I spent so much time with it

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that I know exactly what it's like.

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And so, like, listening to you guys

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
discuss an episode,

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it just brings me right back.

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's like, oh, yeah, this is exactly

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
what that would have looked like.

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And here's what they're talking about.

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I can perfectly envision it.

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And that was also what was trippy about this movie,

252
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
was that for the first, like, 20 minutes,

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it's just an episode of My Little Pony.

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like, if you close your eyes,

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
because the visuals, you can't.

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like, if you just listen to the way the characters

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
are talking,

258
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the things they're saying,

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the sound effects, the music,

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
it's just the show.

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then it develops a plot,

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and becomes really boring.

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What would have been way better

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
if it looked like an episode of My Little Pony,

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
because this shit sucks.

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
God dammit.

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did anyone like the visual aesthetic?

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No.

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, man.

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I thought it was good.

271
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, really?

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's like, you stood, I quite enjoyed it.

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I never stopped.

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, it wasn't always terrible,

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but there were plenty of moments

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that were ruined by the way it was.

277
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, look at their weird big heads

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and creepy eyes, though.

279
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That is hard.

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

282
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
My Little Pony's never had big heads

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and creepy eyes ever.

284
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's to the extreme, though.

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's definitely weird.

286
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You'll let that turn up your game

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
if you want to cut it.

288
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's too much detail.

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
My ass.

290
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I totally disagree.

291
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think the extra frames of animation

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
are great.

293
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I thought the way that there was

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
more rendering detail and everything

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
was great.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My Little Pony's animation was never good.

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They all looked like fucking flash puppets

298
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and moved like them the entire show.

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They were stilted and awkward.

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

301
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And they were never good.

302
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And it was great.

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I loved it.

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

305
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And everyone was saying they looked good

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and were wrong.

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But this was even worse.

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No.

309
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I thought the environments were

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
particularly really well done.

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Here's the background.

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The background was fucking good.

313
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dude, God, I have the perfect analogy.

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's about macaroni and cheese.

315
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You might have macaroni and cheese.

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's made for kids, right?

317
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, God.

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Made for fucking kids, right?

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But then when you're like a late teen,

320
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you're like, man, I still love

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the fucking taste of this.

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I could appreciate this fully.

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But then once you get into your 20s,

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
it's getting more like, well,

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I still like the taste of it,

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but I do like other tastes more.

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And also, I feel like cancer after eating it,

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
like 20 minutes later, I don't know why.

329
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't relate to this analogy

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because I still eat macaroni nearly every day.

331
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, I'm talking specifically about

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Kraft, specifically that box, right?

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For all of us who aren't actively killing

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
our bodies and everything.

335
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Right.

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

337
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So fucking, yeah.

338
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that's the thing with macaroni and cheese, right?

339
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So the same thing as the MLP aesthetic.

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When I was, you know, when it first came out,

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was like, oh my gosh,

342
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
it's just so much good animation.

343
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's like hot colors and fluidity and timing.

344
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But then when I look at it now,

345
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm like, okay, I can see all the ones

346
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and zeros in these fucking vectors, you know?

347
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So basically this movie is like someone

348
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
handing me a bowl of Kraft macaroni and cheese

349
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
with bacon inside.

350
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's like, well, that's going to be tangy AF.

351
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's going to make me feel really gross after eating it.

352
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know?

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You know?

354
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's going to be fucking, it's going to be weird.

355
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But it's going to taste like really intense

356
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and just very childish in that way.

357
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So yeah, it's like people always think,

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
people always think that good animation

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
is always going to be better no matter what.

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I actually fundamentally disagree with that

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because you can't just ramp up the quality of something.

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like the fight scenes in this, particularly the one

363
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
where Tempest beats the shit out of like a random mook

364
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in like that city.

365
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I thought that looked absolutely beautiful

366
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and I was like, now that's something that like

367
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
just enhances the quality of this thing in general.

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Perfectly balanced.

369
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That specifically sucked.

370
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, that specifically was good.

371
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It was like the best part.

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But you can't over-animate

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
just the scenes of people talking

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and like looking at each other dramatically

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
actually makes it more boring and worse

376
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because things take longer to do

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and it drives things out.

378
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, I completely disagree.

379
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think you guys...

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kill and kill is an inventive animation.

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, no, no.

382
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You guys are two, you're two attached

383
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to the style you've known forever.

384
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, I hate the style I've known forever.

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I gotta say, yeah, one of the hardest things

386
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
about trying to go back and watch my little pony for me

387
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is that the animation is dog shit in the show

388
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and like every, I don't know how we...

389
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is the guy who watches anime.

390
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think we all somehow...

391
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like when you get into MLP

392
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
then it's like in the fan community

393
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
every unique facial expression

394
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
that gets introduced is a big deal

395
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
because the show by and large is just the same

396
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
stock shit over and over again.

397
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
As soon as you see like one face of new

398
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
everyone freaks out.

399
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But when you go back and watch the show

400
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
like when you're not in the hype cycle

401
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and you just look at it, you're like,

402
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
oh yeah, it looks like shit.

403
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This movie to me felt like

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
lipstick on a pig.

405
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I enjoyed the aesthetic

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
because I went into it with the right mindset.

407
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now you see the reason why I stopped watching MLP

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
right around season five

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
since I never got to answer that question

410
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
since everyone seems to always

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
fucking ignore me when we go round about.

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll get over it later.

413
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Anyway, I have a fucking pillow to yell at

414
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
so I'm fine anyway.

415
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So after getting out of MLP

416
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I discovered this thing called,

417
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know if you've heard of it, anime, right?

418
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Now that's where like you have stuff that like

419
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
there's this one show called

420
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Kill Law Kills Inventive Animation

421
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and that's a really good aesthetic.

422
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then there's like this other show

423
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
called like the incredible pacing

424
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and visual imagery of Sound God's To No Lion

425
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
by Super Eye Patch Wolf, the son.

426
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's a good anime I like as well.

427
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
With incredibly well timed imagery

428
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've had so much incredible aesthetic.

429
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's like how much more exciting

430
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
can a show be than Kill Law Kills Inventive Animation?

431
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How much more fucking well

432
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
directed can a show be other than

433
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sound God's To No Lion by Super Eye Patch Wolf?

434
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like you can't have anything better than that.

435
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So it really is like someone saying

436
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
hey man you want to eat some macaroni and cheese

437
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
with fucking bacon bits and maybe someone

438
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
will put some soy sauce on it.

439
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You really, really milk in this analogy.

440
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, well I love food analogies.

441
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not sure if I buy into it completely.

442
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Who does love milk?

443
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What the fuck is the boo?

444
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What the fuck is the boo?

445
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The name is Tape Stack.

446
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's a set deck because that was somebody else's

447
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Pony Osea and it's similar enough that it's

448
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
fucking out of my head.

449
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I hope you guys understand what this podcast is going to be.

450
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's just going to be like eight people talking

451
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
all over each other all at once and then

452
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
long stretches of just DeVoo talking only.

453
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So just another episode of the PCP.

454
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I want to speak about

455
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the artwork.

456
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The animation.

457
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do it. You're the one with the most animation

458
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
knowledge.

459
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're a regular Bugs Bunny ancient.

460
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Cowboy.

461
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm going to plump you up real hard

462
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and spread my necklace across your lip

463
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
in the second you're spread.

464
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh my god.

465
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Go on.

466
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What the fuck, Strawberry?

467
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Simmer down.

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's okay. He loves sex. I understand.

469
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I came into this

470
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
seeing because I saw the trailer and it looked weird.

471
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The pinkie was like

472
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
she's falling and her nose looked like

473
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
a weird pig nose and didn't look right.

474
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Weren't caught in the movie.

475
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The thing is

476
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the trailer shows all the worst bits

477
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
because it just

478
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Anyway

479
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I thought

480
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I would hate it because it was kind of weird

481
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
but I also noticed

482
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it's like they're doing a Disney thing

483
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
with the pony thing

484
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and I just sort of got used to it

485
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and then I started to like it.

486
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I started to like the extra frames.

487
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I really liked all the moments where Tempest

488
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
was looking down at the camera

489
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and she was the best animated

490
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
character in the whole movie.

491
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She was good.

492
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In the new art style, yeah.

493
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Tempest was the best.

494
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She was designed for it.

495
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's like Joachim's adventure.

496
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What made?

497
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Everyone shut the fuck up.

498
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And everything on the water was great.

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

500
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The new animation

501
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
really suited Tempest the most, I think.

502
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
All the rest

503
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
were kind of like

504
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
like I said, I got used to it eventually

505
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
but they all were very sort of like

506
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
still squishy and sort of

507
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
soft looking.

508
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's always been that way but yeah, definitely to a larger degree.

509
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And you know how much I love soft looking things.

510
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think the problem is that

511
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the MLP animation has always

512
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
had a really difficult time

513
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
dealing with extreme foreshortens

514
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
poses, like even in the regular show.

515
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's always like the thing, one of my

516
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
little pet peeves of the animation style

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
which persists in this animation swap

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
is that whenever you look at a regular

519
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
design pony from straight on, the muzzle

520
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
is never done correctly in perspective.

521
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It just looks like someone slapped a shape on top

522
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
of a flat face and that's why when you get

523
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that perspective shot with Pinky, it looks all fucked up

524
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because I don't know how to draw that

525
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
from not a three fourths or profile view

526
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
it works even less well

527
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in this more detailed style.

528
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The point of the aesthetic is to add cinematic

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
to the MLP viewer.

530
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's exactly right.

531
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's often derided by being overused

532
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
but in this context it's, hey

533
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
TV show that looks really good

534
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
by its own standards, that's been going on for seven seasons.

535
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Here, here's a cinematic version

536
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
because it's an exciting way to deliver

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
a little tight.

538
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's definitely hype to see it

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that way. The problem is that I don't think

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the character designs translate well to it.

541
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
When you see the characters

542
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in three fourths faces

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
when you see that other eye

544
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
on the other side of their face

545
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that just looks fucked up to me.

546
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Some of the characters work better than others.

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Twilight talking

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to the princesses in the beginning

549
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and I was just looking at her eyes

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like why are they wrong?

551
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And they also added detail to the eyes

552
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
like anime style.

553
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The way that they made the shines

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
translucent.

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That was the biggest problem for me.

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Although I didn't like the detail in the irises

557
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
like how the irises are all speckled and stuff.

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, I was cool.

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I was never part of this whole analysis community.

560
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Was this what it was like?

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's weird that none of the other characters have it.

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How did you last it?

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Just the main ponies have that.

564
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I think

565
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
my impression of the animation

566
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and of everything in the movie

567
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
was a constant series of

568
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
slugged.

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You'd see sometimes

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
there would be a piece of animation

571
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
that's like, yeah, okay, that worked.

572
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Or a joke.

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think Twilight showing

574
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Celestia and Luna like the angles

575
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
she wants them to put the sun and the moon at the beginning.

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was like, yeah, okay, that's a good Twilight joke.

577
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's something she do and say.

578
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The ghost in this movie

579
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
felt so fucking flat.

580
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I can't even believe that.

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Mage, mage, mage, mage, mage, mage.

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Everyone shut up.

583
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't understand why the princesses

584
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
didn't want to go with that plan because

585
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
why?

586
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's not much effort to do that

587
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
because when later the guy gets the staff

588
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
he just plays around with the sun and the moon

589
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
like it's nuts.

590
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He's like, I have a great idea

591
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
for something you can do

592
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and they're like, that is a great idea

593
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and we totally could do it, but we won't.

594
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Good luck.

595
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The princesses have to stay in character

596
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
useless.

597
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If they actually did something productive

598
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I would have been totally unsold.

599
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I am mighty and better than you.

600
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have something to say

601
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
when

602
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Twilight's like, hey, I need this utility

603
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
so the concert will be cool.

604
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They're like, we believe in you.

605
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't worry, you're a princess too.

606
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sure you can do it.

607
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sure you can do it and she's like,

608
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
no, this is what I want to do.

609
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You put me in charge and this is what I fucking want.

610
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're supposed to be able to do that.

611
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think the idea is that they're saying

612
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
we can't just fuck up the day-night cycle

613
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
of the world for one party.

614
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's other consequences of doing that.

615
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think they just don't understand math

616
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and they were saving face.

617
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But the Storm King does that later.

618
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The Storm King fucks it up later and no, it's fine.

619
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Everyone's fine.

620
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Guys.

621
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Guys though,

622
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Twilight said that it was about the time

623
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
when the sun is supposed to be setting

624
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and the moon was probably going to be rising

625
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
at around the same time, so all they had to do

626
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
was just hold it for a little bit

627
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in the same place. Nothing was going to get fucked up.

628
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That will fuck up people

629
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
who are looking at the sun and they're like,

630
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
why is the sun no here?

631
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Some port sailor on the sea

632
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is going to lose his way

633
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because they're like a minute.

634
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They know that the sun and moon are reliable.

635
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You stop and ballot out there

636
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
right now.

637
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We have to think of him.

638
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's how it is.

639
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Phantom Horde.

640
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The sun and moon

641
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
they're not just

642
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
over Equestria.

643
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's like the whole world's sun and moon.

644
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I was thinking about this

645
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the very day, when Celestia and Luna

646
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
fuck with the sun and the moon, is that just an Equestria thing?

647
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Because only the ponies do that

648
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's like how America

649
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is the world police.

650
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
These guys are the world sun

651
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like when the Sun and the Moon get fucked up are like the fucking cat people and like parrot people and like the hydro ponies and whatever

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are they all like, oh, I guess I guess the ponies are having a fucking war again

653
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Equestria is like the America to that world where like all the third world countries get fucked every time we do something

654
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The point I was trying to make simply is that if they hold the Sun and Moon in place it will fuck up for everybody in the world

655
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And this is just for a party that's just

656
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The Sun and Moon could be contextual, you know, it's like in Dark Souls now, since it's 2013 again

657
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You might not know about the game called Dark Souls where the Sun is different in certain places

658
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So just saying, it's an establishable concept

659
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No, if it's 2013, then Dark Souls is exactly what we're talking about

660
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I know what the Sun and Moon theory, the Flat Earth theory, this totally makes sense

661
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Because they just go in circles, they move in circles around this, yeah, that totally works

662
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Fucking crazy, get off the dark part of YouTube

663
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
All the new Pokemon they added were hard to get and I couldn't find them anywhere, they just had such a low percent rate

664
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I just couldn't find any of them

665
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're missing the force through the trees, the point is that the animation, they all look chubby and scary, like vaguely like meaty

666
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Like they have flesh, they eat their dumb, plump up cheeks, I just want to plump them up real high

667
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I just want to lift up their stomachs real quick, real fast, real good, and just feel those shells

668
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're entirely correct, and that stems from a larger, I would call it a problem

669
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And it's exactly what Davoo is saying

670
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Who the fuck is this person you keep comparing to?

671
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm sorry, a tape stack, my old companion in his beloved braces

672
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He's a new companion, you fucking retard

673
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Son

674
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, exactly

675
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So I'm looking right now at a screenshot of the princesses at the beginning

676
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And they look normal and good

677
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then I go like one frame over to Twilight and then she looks all fucked up and weird

678
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And that's the problem with this movie

679
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's everything that is involved with turning a cartoon into a movie I always hate and it's never been done right

680
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's like I said, the style sort of fits Tempest and she has sort of the same facial features as the princesses

681
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's that nose shape, you can't have the little bubbly nose because it doesn't work

682
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's not just the character designs either, this spills over into the narrative

683
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Where A, they have to baby us by teaching us what all the characters do every time

684
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Do

685
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The beginning of the movie was just like, hey Rarity, you like fashion, right?

686
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Sure do, bud, sure do

687
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I knew who was going to do that shit

688
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That seemed acceptable

689
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I like how they established it's like X-Rarity even though that's completely irrelevant to them

690
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I got it so irrelevant to the movie

691
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The thing is, I don't think it was about babying us

692
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
This movie just contains every piece of information about my little pony in it

693
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's the people who haven't seen it before can just watch the movie, of course

694
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Not even that, not even that, I don't think that's what they were going for

695
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think it's for fan service, I think it's so that everything they could possibly make

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Every background pony is in just the opening scene

697
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Every single named one, everybody makes an appearance

698
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Every callback imaginable is made

699
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I was actually distracted by that

700
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
To people who don't know

701
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There's the end of the movie, everyone's having a good time

702
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then both biceps just shows up and no one who watches the show goes like, what the fuck is that?

703
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
No play

704
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Why is that?

705
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He was in the movie though, he was in the movie a number of times

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, but that's my only point, it doesn't make sense that he was just a joke

707
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I mean, no play didn't make sense to begin with

708
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He was just a random sight gang

709
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I was really distracted by Rainbow Dash saying three seconds flat, Fluttershy saying

710
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh my god, when Fluttershy said two times

711
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, when he said it's the first time I rolled my eyes

712
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
When he said it's the second time I literally hung myself

713
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Alright, the worst thing about this movie, I don't know the worst thing

714
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But one of the things I didn't like was the fact that most of the main six they got something to do

715
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They either had a song or they were somehow helpful

716
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Fluttershy said yay twice and did absolutely nothing

717
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Just like the regular show, she was in character

718
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I made an itemized list, I analyzed

719
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We're going right back

720
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What's up with this fucking cheesy Gornita Crunch is doing her shit

721
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, there it is

722
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Listen, I analyzed this film with a fine tooth microscope

723
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I determined scientifically that there were, of the main crew

724
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There were a full three characters who did literally nothing in the entire movie

725
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And it was Fluttershy, Rarity and Applejack

726
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What about Rainbow Dash, what did she do?

727
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I want to talk about Rainbow Dash

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I want to talk about everything, that's what Rainbow Dash did

729
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
She is in fact a regular show

730
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Okay, guys, okay, okay

731
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This falls into the mean category

732
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
What I want to know, I called the police, called the mayor, called the president

733
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What was with the weird insertion of the Sonic Rain Boom

734
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The Sonic Rain Boom was never like a means

735
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It was a band service, it was totally a band service

736
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It was totally a band service

737
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
She just wanted to do it

738
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It was really weird that she was so adamant about it throughout the movie

739
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
She keeps bringing it up, and I was like, why, she's not like that

740
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay, wait, I've got it

741
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In canon explanation, Rainbow is meeting a bunch of new friends

742
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
She's in a new place, she wants them to see

743
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She wants them to see her cool things she can do with the rainbow

744
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That's why she wanted to

745
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That was in season one, it was so long ago

746
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And you're like, gay was in season one too

747
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaking of Rainbow

748
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It was like beginning of the show memes

749
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What's the deal, bro, what's up?

750
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Entry level, basic bitch shit

751
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Speaking of basic bitch shit

752
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Did Rainbow really need another song about awesome?

753
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm getting second verse

754
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That song is literally, that song is my least favorite part

755
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And I'll tell you why

756
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Because when the pirates were being like, wait a minute

757
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Let's cast off the yoke of the man and rediscover our true selves

758
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I like the design of the pirates

759
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I really wanted to get excited for that part

760
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Like I could feel myself almost enjoying myself

761
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But then the song came on

762
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And the song, it's time to be awesome

763
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I hated it

764
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I hated the song so much that it ruined the moment

765
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was really hoping that they'd have this big song

766
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No, because the whole reason they said

767
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
She's trying to get them to sing the songs

768
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't want to get kicked off the ship

769
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I was really hoping they'd have this big moment of them being

770
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, we're pirates

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then they fucking made them walk the plank anyway

772
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Because they're pirates

773
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too

774
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We've all been doing the opinions of this movie

775
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's just backwards

776
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Here's what you do with a movie like this

777
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You cooperate with it and reduce a point

778
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In exchange for your cooperation

779
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So as soon as the movie begins

780
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I promise I won't have any food analogies

781
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The movie begins to a parody of an 80's song

782
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
With a pony's lyrics inside

783
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Wait, are you doing a mysterious Mr. Enter right here?

784
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Is that what's going on?

785
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Or are you being legitimate?

786
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I thought you were memeing for a second

787
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Well, I don't know, you tell me

788
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Because mysterious Mr. Enter's thing

789
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is that he would start each episode with five points

790
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And he would reduce or add them based on

791
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Whether or not something good or bad

792
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
See, I never watched stupid videos

793
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That is how I start my videos, they're great

794
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I went into it assuming it was going to be bad

795
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then pretty early on I'm like

796
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Wait, I wanted to talk more about the pirate

797
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I want to say two things too

798
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We have to get organized here

799
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We've got to get organized here

800
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Everyone was like

801
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Everyone has to be in this episode

802
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's got to be the whole crew

803
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is good, this is what the people want

804
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If we just analyze the fact for a second

805
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That this podcast will mean

806
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Literally nothing to like

807
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
80% of our audience

808
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't give a shit, I want that

809
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I want them to f-

810
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If they don't know Peg, if they don't know Digi

811
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If they don't know Phantom, if they don't know

812
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Give them they don't know anything

813
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The real point, the entire conceit of the PCP

814
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I never told any of this

815
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The whole point of it was to get people into

816
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
My little pony, 80 episodes of this shit

817
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This is what it's all been for

818
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm talking about of the PCP

819
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This is like 80 episodes now or something

820
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You fucking idiot

821
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I tricked you

822
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're a brony now

823
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Look down at yourself, that's the body of a brony

824
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You fool

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And what a body it is

826
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
While we're off topic, I want to

827
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Pause it a backstory for

828
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
TapeStack, if that's okay

829
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Here's a suggestion to be

830
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The backstory of TapeStack

831
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
TapeStack is a huge

832
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
MLP analysis fan

833
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Who has all of our stuff on Tape

834
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He had everybody's analysis

835
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
On video

836
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And he had like this huge collection

837
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He put his VHS tape into YouTube

838
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And recorded it

839
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And then there was like a brony con going on

840
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And he met all of us and was hanging out with the

841
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
With the group and he showed us his tape collection

842
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We were really impressed and we wanted to be friends

843
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And that's how we met TapeStack

844
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So brony con is now canon to the

845
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
My little pony universe

846
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I think though

847
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Wasn't there actually a brony convention

848
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
In the show

849
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Wasn't there actually a brony convention

850
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
In the show where Patton Oswald was there

851
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Or something

852
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That did happen

853
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And they just made fun of the entire fandom

854
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That is a real thing

855
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I want to complain about the pirates some more

856
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because they made me really mad

857
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I do want to make two points as well

858
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You can go first and then I'll go

859
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Okay first point

860
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Alright everyone knows what a pirate is

861
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And what a pirate does

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Why would they think it's awesome and want them to continue to be pirates

863
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's stupid

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Well I have an answer to that

865
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's because they're not actually pirates

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
When they describe their job as pirates

867
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
They say they're treasure hunters

868
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They do not actually engage in piracy

869
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The entire pirate conceit is fucking retarded

870
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because we get to the scene

871
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And it's like oh we're being

872
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Impressed by the Storm King

873
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And she's like oh be pirates again

874
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Does Storm King just do to them again

875
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Whatever he did to subjugate them

876
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh my fucking god

877
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
My first problem

878
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
How is that not immediately what you thought

879
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
When this scene came

880
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because that was all I thought

881
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This makes no fucking sense

882
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This is the least sense making thing I've ever seen

883
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I was fine with Rainbow Dash

884
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That was the moment the movie was dead for me

885
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I was fine with Rainbow Dash convincing them to be pirates again

886
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But then when Tempest showed up I was like

887
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh okay she's gonna see that they've gone back to the pirate

888
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And they're gonna get in trouble with the Storm King

889
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No Tempest sees

890
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That they've fucking thrown off their duties

891
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And they've gone back to them and she doesn't even care

892
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
She doesn't do anything

893
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The most cleverly written scene in the movie

894
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Where it's like suddenly lunch

895
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's a funny subversion

896
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's a funny subversion of your expectations

897
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's a cruel way of establishing some world building

898
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
About how the fucking guy

899
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Has been taking over the whole universe

900
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Basic shit

901
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You just get to know about their characters

902
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And you empathize with them

903
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And then someone goes

904
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Hey, stand up for yourself

905
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Stop being afraid

906
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But apparently that makes no sense

907
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
People never have a point where they turn around

908
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
To realize they stand up for themselves

909
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
They never found that

910
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So that's fine as they did

911
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But there should have been consequences

912
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
If there were no consequences for them

913
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Going back to being pirates

914
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then why did they start being different

915
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
They literally were just scared

916
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They were totally consequential

917
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, they didn't

918
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That's not because they went back to being pirates

919
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's because they were harboring prisoners

920
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They didn't realize they didn't swap their costumes

921
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They didn't realize they didn't swap their costumes

922
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They were standing right fucking there

923
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What the fuck

924
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That was a stupid thing

925
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They should have immediately put their costumes back on

926
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I would agree with that

927
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I have to say something

928
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I have to

929
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Please give him please

930
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Rainbow Dash was like

931
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hey, you guys should be pirates

932
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But not because she's a good friend

933
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Here's the headcan reason why

934
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's because she knows that she just wants to trick them

935
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So she doesn't die

936
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then it's like

937
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You guys should be pirates and they're like

938
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There's no apprehension or anything

939
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's just like please be pirates again

940
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Please

941
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
As Ben touched on

942
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I thought that the point of the scene

943
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Was going to be that the pirates were stupid

944
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That like they were going to have this whole

945
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Up like they're going to reform everything

946
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then the ponies after having

947
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Like reformed the pirates were just going to

948
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Skate or get like brought to somewhere else

949
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then the bad guys were going to show up and immediately

950
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Subjugate the pirates again they're going to be like

951
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh right of course how could we forget

952
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That we are under the rule of the storm king

953
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And we can't actually just rise up out of nowhere

954
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Because he's more powerful than us

955
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But like no

956
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
They just are characters now

957
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And more than that like pirates

958
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Are not necessarily good people

959
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They really should

960
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The whole thing of them doing the awesome song

961
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Was completely out of self interest

962
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's why I say this script

963
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's why I say this goddamn script was

964
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Babyfied there's this idea that like

965
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Pirates are just like cool guys

966
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The show is for babies

967
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Dude you spent years talking about the show

968
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It is not

969
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You need to say something

970
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Alright

971
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You guys are all wrong in every aspect

972
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You're not thinking

973
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Let me explain to you what my little pony is

974
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It is

975
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
A show

976
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's alright

977
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But it has occasional flashes of

978
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh that's nice

979
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's a show that's

980
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Whatever and it's got a few little nuggets of

981
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Cool shit

982
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
People noticed that there was cool shit

983
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
In a show about ponies and they thought

984
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Wow that's really unexpected

985
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And they formed a community around it

986
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Everybody started analyzing it

987
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And everyone's a stupid idiot

988
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Pirates are cool

989
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Airships are cool

990
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I liked it

991
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The whole movie was great and I can't believe

992
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The continuity errors god damn

993
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The continuity errors

994
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I want to explain how I watched this movie

995
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because I did not go into this

996
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Like

997
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I think some mothers did

998
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I went into this movie

999
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I heard it was bad from Ben and Jackie

1000
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or Phantom and

1001
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What was her equity

1002
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That's a genius name by the way

1003
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Let me quickly

1004
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Touch on the fact that walking into the theater

1005
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
She was talking about her theater

1006
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
At which theater soon

1007
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's important to me

1008
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
She got accosted by some guy in a pony shirt

1009
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Who was like

1010
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And right then the tone

1011
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Was bad for the theater

1012
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So a man asked her a question

1013
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And she was deeply offended

1014
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He was waiting around in the lobby

1015
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I got the feeling

1016
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That he was waiting around to meet

1017
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
His fellow bronies

1018
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And then he spotted too right before

1019
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But he knew it was time

1020
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
His dar was on

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Gibbon you liking something big

1022
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Big mistake

1023
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You're gonna get knocked into some pins

1024
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Come up your location about 5-10 minutes

1025
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Gonna knock you right down

1026
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Really soon

1027
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What we were talking about

1028
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Did you want to share your experience

1029
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay, okay, okay

1030
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Quiet the rails into like

1031
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Random nothing

1032
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Okay, okay, I have a story

1033
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I showed up to the theater with my posse

1034
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Of insane clowns

1035
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I just want to flip, I just want to flip so hard

1036
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Employees get sweaty, I just want to get plumped up

1037
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm gonna rough these guys around a bit

1038
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm gonna slap their lip a few times

1039
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And so

1040
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I order some pretzel bites

1041
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And I assume they're pre-cooked

1042
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Like anus wasters

1043
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But like I order them

1044
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What the fuck

1045
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And so

1046
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So I order them and the cashiers

1047
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Like alright you're just gonna come out real soon

1048
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I'm like at the naive fool I am

1049
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I say like okay, I go wait by that side of the corner

1050
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
With my friend Kyle, I talk about this couple for

1051
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Fuck you Kyle, he immediately starts

1052
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Jeering me most rudely

1053
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
With his gnarled fangs and his angular

1054
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Visage and he's just eating

1055
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So we're gonna be late, I tell him please don't be mean

1056
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm just gonna be slapping around here

1057
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Real soon, right quick right now

1058
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The demon persists the clocks

1059
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
To get down the minutes right before the movie

1060
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Get shorter and shorter, his flamboyantly hostile

1061
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Demeter rocks the very coal in my spine

1062
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He's like a furry freaky friend

1063
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But only worse and gay

1064
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Anyway I get the pretzels and

1065
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We weren't late for the movie but we were really close

1066
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Fuck you Kyle, stop being mean to me

1067
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And they were like

1068
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, there's a lot of bronies and stuff

1069
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I also got

1070
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I also got

1071
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
My first movie

1072
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My little pony certificate, they had like these like

1073
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Certificates you could get out

1074
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
What the fuck

1075
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like all the five year olds who come to the movie

1076
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Like ready to get their cinema cherry popped

1077
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I got the certificate

1078
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is that like a Mew?

1079
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Write down your pony name, write down your pony name

1080
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Write down your date of birth and like day to day

1081
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And your movie theater like place

1082
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Is that like the promotional Mew cards

1083
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That you got at Pokemon?

1084
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It all ties together

1085
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The history repeats itself

1086
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The purpose was to like

1087
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Write down their first movie experience

1088
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But like everyone took them or just like 19 to 26 year old guys

1089
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And they just always wrote down

1090
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
That this was their first movie they've ever seen

1091
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Wow

1092
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Awesome

1093
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So the reason I wanted to bring up my viewing experience

1094
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I had already heard from Phantom Inequity

1095
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
That the movie was supposed to be really bad

1096
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I thought it looked really bad

1097
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So I was like I'm going to get drunk and watch this movie

1098
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And I didn't want to go out and pay for it

1099
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I was really resistant to being on this podcast

1100
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Because I didn't want to have to pay for the movie

1101
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
We left you no alternative

1102
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But then the greatest bro in the world

1103
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Keg Standard

1104
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
As he would typically do

1105
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Found an illegal download of the movie for me

1106
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's right

1107
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So here's the thing

1108
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I watched this with my girlfriend

1109
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Who has never watched my little pony

1110
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
She seemed like maybe two episodes of the original show

1111
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And completely avoided it

1112
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I thought it was like I don't want to be a part of this thing

1113
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This song

1114
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
She recognized

1115
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
All the autistic people she knew were into this show

1116
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So she paid a little bit

1117
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Such a significant other

1118
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Did you bro?

1119
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So

1120
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I went into this movie

1121
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
With a weird mixed feeling

1122
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Because on the one hand I was expecting it to be bad

1123
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And I was drinking

1124
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
We were both drunk when we watched it

1125
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But I also really

1126
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Wanted it to be good

1127
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Because I want to convince her

1128
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That I'm not a fucking

1129
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You're reminding me of my little pony

1130
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So

1131
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
This is the wrong vehicle for that

1132
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
In many ways

1133
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The early part of the movie

1134
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Was actually good

1135
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I liked the first 20 minutes

1136
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Because I thought it represented

1137
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What is good about the character interactions

1138
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
In the show pretty well

1139
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Oh you're a fucking

1140
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm gonna knock you down

1141
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Lots of lines that immediately

1142
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Get to the heart of what's good

1143
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You get that Twilight's over

1144
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
She's overbearing

1145
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
She tries to prepare way too hard

1146
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You see the endearing qualities

1147
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Of Twilight in that early part of the movie

1148
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That was just to check off her character

1149
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Like oh she likes that

1150
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I agree

1151
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It was just checking off a list

1152
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You're watching if someone who's never seen

1153
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
My little pony before is watching this movie

1154
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And you're checking off a list of all the

1155
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Best character traits of the characters

1156
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's a good place to be

1157
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
She was laughing at the jokes

1158
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And thinking

1159
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Things that are good about this

1160
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes see

1161
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Every time something would happen

1162
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That was indicative of something

1163
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I would explain it

1164
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh yeah Fluttershy is like this

1165
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh god you mansplained the entire movie

1166
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's disgusting

1167
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Well the entire movie

1168
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Because then we got to the point where

1169
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
They start introducing the plot

1170
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And it immediately starts going downhill

1171
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And I start explaining

1172
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh yeah well you know

1173
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Every time they would do a two-parter episode

1174
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And they'd introduce a villain

1175
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Those are always shitty episodes

1176
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Because it's not really like the shows about

1177
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And it's like

1178
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The movie was just like an adventure season finale

1179
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
With all the problems

1180
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Exactly

1181
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
How many times have we all railed against

1182
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Those specific episodes

1183
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh look at all these backgrounds

1184
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Look at all these side characters that have nothing to do

1185
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Here we go again

1186
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Not just MLP, any show in the universe right

1187
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What is the worst episode of any show

1188
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The episode that you try to show

1189
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
To a new person that's a friend of yours

1190
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Who's not seen it before

1191
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Always going to be a fucking dumpster fire

1192
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Unless you calculate which episode

1193
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If it's a random episode

1194
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's the worst episode

1195
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Right but it's just like episode one

1196
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
To show it to a friend

1197
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The problem with the Nightmare Mooner

1198
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I smile for you because

1199
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
My girlfriend has the exact same taste as me

1200
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
My girlfriend has the same taste as me

1201
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
My girlfriend has the same taste as me

1202
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And I show her everything

1203
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That I like

1204
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And she always feels exactly like I do

1205
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And I hated this movie

1206
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And she hated the movie

1207
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And it was

1208
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I felt like the first 20 minutes

1209
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Was a lot of me going

1210
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Ah yes, thank you movie

1211
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
His name is strawberry milk, you son of a bitch

1212
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Thank you

1213
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
My little pony movie

1214
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
For proving that there are things about the show

1215
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That are obviously like interesting or good

1216
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So that it doesn't look like I'm insane for liking this

1217
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But then as it goes on

1218
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And there's so many songs

1219
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So many fucking piss breaks in this movie

1220
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The songs, the songs

1221
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The range from mediocre to bad

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I've always liked all the songs

1223
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Hold on, hold on

1224
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You said that, hold on

1225
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Jackie was saying that too

1226
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I completely disagree

1227
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
There were a lot of great songs in the show

1228
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We all knew the words of them

1229
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I know the words

1230
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I haven't watched MLP in fucking years

1231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And I still remember all the songs

1232
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That were good, 20 minutes after

1233
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
All the songs that were good

1234
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You cannot tell me that you don't like

1235
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Giggle at the ghosties

1236
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I can't tell me

1237
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You can't tell me you don't like the cupcake song

1238
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's a good song

1239
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You can't tell me you don't like

1240
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The songs fucking

1241
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But here's the thing

1242
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Even if you don't like those songs

1243
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You remember them

1244
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
They got good hooks and shit

1245
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I don't remember shit from this movie

1246
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
None of them are memorable

1247
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I remember the second song

1248
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It was literally friend like me from Aladdin

1249
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There were no differences

1250
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That was the only song in the movie

1251
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I didn't hate so I guess that's why

1252
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Can we acknowledge the fact

1253
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That the songs were absolutely pointless

1254
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Because they established something

1255
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And then they take a few minutes

1256
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
To sing about the already established thing

1257
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Oh hey Twilight

1258
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We're here, we're gonna help you

1259
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Now let's sing about how we're gonna help you

1260
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh hey, I'm the Swab and Colton guy

1261
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But no sings

1262
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Let's sing about it

1263
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Tempest or whatever her name was

1264
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
With her song is that she's standing

1265
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
In a room singing

1266
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
As soon as that happened

1267
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I was like this is gonna be boring

1268
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But the flashback was good

1269
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That was the worst part of the movie

1270
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Every part of the movie

1271
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Every part is the worst part of the movie

1272
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I wanna address

1273
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Probably my biggest complaint

1274
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
About this movie

1275
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Is how badly

1276
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It copies Disney movies

1277
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Every song

1278
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Is a ripoff version of a Disney song

1279
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Every new character

1280
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay, the main villain

1281
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
He's literally Hades from

1282
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Our greed completely

1283
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I had that in my blue flame

1284
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He's all like I'm a

1285
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm this guy, I'm a funny guy

1286
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I love merchandise, I'm his yo

1287
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I love his rebranding

1288
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Is it that different from like discord though

1289
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I got the feeling they were trying to do like a discord

1290
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You're an unrelated problem

1291
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That I had with the Storm King

1292
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
He's so much like Tyric

1293
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah, that's amazing

1294
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Then you've got the girl

1295
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Tempest

1296
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
All of her facial expressions

1297
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Are literally copy pastes

1298
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Of Isma from the Emperor's New Groove

1299
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And the placement of the

1300
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Bunga character is Cron

1301
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Isma was way more expressive

1302
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Isma was way more expressive

1303
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But all of Tempest's expressions

1304
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That she does have are copied from Isma

1305
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The fifth doll Tony was so upset

1306
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
She should have personality wise

1307
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
No, but the animation

1308
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
A Tempest issue

1309
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Due to my past

1310
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Racial dysphoria

1311
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Which I have fully overcome

1312
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's all in the past that's over

1313
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Due to those past unpleasantnesses

1314
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I was heavily triggered

1315
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I was heavily triggered by Tempest

1316
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And I was very interested

1317
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I was very interested in hearing her backstory

1318
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And I was so let down when I finally heard it

1319
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Because you can infer everything

1320
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That there's nothing to her backstory

1321
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Other than what you can see at a fucking glance

1322
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You see that she's a unicorn

1323
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And her horn's broken

1324
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What's her backstory is that she broke her horn

1325
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's the whole thing

1326
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's like she was betrayed by her friends

1327
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
She was wandering into a fucking bear cave

1328
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And they're like oh we shouldn't do this

1329
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And she was like nah I want my ball

1330
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And then they didn't want to play with her

1331
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because their horn kept shooting out death explosions

1332
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
By accident

1333
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And understandably she's a little upset about it

1334
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
She's a little upset

1335
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Her friends don't like her because she's crippled

1336
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's the reason you come out and say it

1337
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Movies come out and say it

1338
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
By the way I did want to point out

1339
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That Tyric

1340
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And his white legion of faceless goons

1341
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Clearly represent the disgusting white race

1342
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And diversity champions over them in the end

1343
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So uh

1344
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
They only have black people

1345
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Exactly the human white mumkeys

1346
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Weird cat man

1347
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Whose design I hate

1348
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Why was he so black

1349
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah he was

1350
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Dude dude you want you want

1351
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
That's the point

1352
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It doesn't matter it's fine

1353
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's not how it was

1354
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It bothered me that he was the only cat

1355
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It bothered me that there were no other cats

1356
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's kind of true

1357
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think it's weird that like

1358
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Maybe if everyone in the town

1359
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Like was black

1360
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It would make sense

1361
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But the fact that this guy is super black

1362
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Would nobody else

1363
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Dude put that aside because the weird thing is

1364
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The sea pony queen like clearly has like

1365
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That accent and then her daughter

1366
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Not even close

1367
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
She's pinkie pie too

1368
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Cat bro is

1369
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Cat bro's animation

1370
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Is clearly based on the black guy

1371
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
From uh well the black

1372
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Bad guy from princess and the frog

1373
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Whereas the song he sings is

1374
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Friend like me by genie

1375
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The whole movie is just cobbled

1376
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And the fucking stupid rainbow dash song

1377
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Is just everything is awesome from the Lego movie

1378
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like this is just cobbled together

1379
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Ideas of other movies

1380
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Other better movies for that matter

1381
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That happens when you try to like it dude

1382
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I want to harp on

1383
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I want to harp on the similarities between the cat guy

1384
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And Aladdin specifically

1385
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because he has the same sort of like uh

1386
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Like MC Escher uh lower body

1387
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That Aladdin has when he moves

1388
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
He's in this desert type rule of setting

1389
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Which I hate by the way I'm gonna give that one to get to the location

1390
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
In this movie but also there is this

1391
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Specific shot in that scene

1392
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Where he is like

1393
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Like he's lowering down a plank

1394
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Across two buildings for the pony

1395
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Which is literally a like screen

1396
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Re-draw trace

1397
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Of a shot from Aladdin

1398
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That exact same shot is set up and composed

1399
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Like an exact shot from Aladdin

1400
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Where Aladdin puts down a plank between

1401
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Buildings for Jasmine

1402
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
During the whole pirate scene

1403
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I gotta think of a pony name for my

1404
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I don't know

1405
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Whatever pony she is

1406
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Big slut

1407
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The pirate scene

1408
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Was um

1409
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Very reminiscent of uh

1410
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Atlantis the Disney movie Atlantis

1411
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The design of the uh

1412
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The function of this movie is

1413
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
If you're into the pony brony

1414
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Mindset then it's a hey

1415
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Here's an episode that feels cinematic

1416
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And if you go into it thinking oh man

1417
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I hope it wows me

1418
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Every single time something kind of good happens

1419
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You will juice every single ounce of juice

1420
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That you can get out of it and try to suck it up as much as possible

1421
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
To justify the fact that you're trying to like it

1422
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And then every single thing that's bad will fuck you up

1423
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
You know there's always concede

1424
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You have to like accept if you want to have a tolerable experience

1425
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
The problem with your premise for me

1426
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Is that I don't like the show anymore

1427
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So it's not like if I just view it as an episode

1428
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That's cinematic then it's like

1429
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Why am I watching my pony

1430
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That should be the review, the review should be

1431
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Hang on, yeah it would be cinematic

1432
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't know anymore, it says why wasn't it the masterpiece

1433
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I want to say something

1434
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Since we're on the subject

1435
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Give or take

1436
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's just like the writing of the whole thing

1437
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Was absolutely abysmal

1438
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm so disappointed in the writers

1439
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Like they couldn't even do a proper like

1440
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Chekhov's gun

1441
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I wanted to say this point a lot earlier

1442
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
When we were talking about the rainboom by the way

1443
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This was the second point I never got to

1444
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Like the whole rainboom thing

1445
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I think that was their attempt

1446
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
At like a Chekhov's gun

1447
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Like oh she wanted to do this but she couldn't

1448
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Then they mentioned it a second time

1449
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But she didn't and then eventually she got to do it

1450
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And that's like the worst

1451
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Application

1452
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
She ended up being useless

1453
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah that too

1454
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They're so incompetent

1455
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Like the main five

1456
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
They made absolutely useless

1457
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But they were so incompetent

1458
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
They couldn't even like

1459
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Divide the uselessness equally between

1460
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The main five

1461
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's just like because

1462
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
They gave Pinkie Pie all the reactions

1463
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And because they gave Pinkie Pie

1464
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
All the reactions

1465
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
She just kind of like

1466
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
She's the mean one

1467
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But like she completely killed the tone

1468
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Every time the tension was up

1469
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
She killed it because they gave her the reaction

1470
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
They gave her screen time

1471
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And she killed everything

1472
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Even more than just the jokes themselves

1473
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Being bad which they all were

1474
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
There was like one or two jokes

1475
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There was exactly one joke that was fun

1476
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And it was when the pirates are like

1477
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Let's do bad things

1478
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And one of them says let's scar them

1479
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And Rarity's like

1480
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Emotionally

1481
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That was great

1482
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That was literally the only joke

1483
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
There was a bunch of jokes I needed honestly

1484
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I laughed at some of the Bunga jokes

1485
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh no

1486
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
What the hell dude

1487
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That was a nice joke

1488
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Dude I'm gonna saddle you up

1489
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm gonna knock you right off your horse

1490
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm gonna knock you down

1491
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm not very critical of comedy

1492
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I liked the whole

1493
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Bunga was like surprisingly not terrible

1494
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
By the way

1495
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Not terrible but not good

1496
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
What I didn't like about him

1497
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Is that as the movie went on

1498
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I felt like he got progressively more retarded

1499
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Early on he didn't seem like just

1500
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
An idiot he seemed like more of a

1501
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Like weird

1502
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Like he thinks he's a badass

1503
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Kind of but like also

1504
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's just like a stoner comedy kind of guy

1505
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Kind of lazy

1506
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But then as it goes on

1507
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
He starts acting like more

1508
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There's a lot of characters that seem kind of like

1509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
They're like done with improv behind the microphone

1510
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And it's uh it's it's competent

1511
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
But it doesn't really fit the whole format of

1512
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
DMLP thing so

1513
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I will compliment this movie

1514
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The fact that um all the new characters

1515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Have better voice actors

1516
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Than anyone in the actual show

1517
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That is indeed true

1518
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like they definitely brought in like real actors

1519
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Or something I don't know who any of them are

1520
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I didn't look it up but like all the new characters

1521
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Were like oh they are like voiced

1522
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Competently and not like a you know

1523
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Like a children's show

1524
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I have no problem with that

1525
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I really liked him this voice

1526
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That's Emily Blunt by the way

1527
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The directing of the movie was ranging from

1528
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Okay to pretty good sometimes

1529
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Because I was having a relaxed viewing experience

1530
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I could just naturally notice things for example

1531
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
By the way uh it was a real

1532
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Okay I'm sorry

1533
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
When the uh the assistant guy who was like

1534
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Cronk shows up right you see him come out of a ship

1535
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And you see him holding a box you can't see him

1536
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
All you can see are his feet and I particularly

1537
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Thought out of my head oh by pedal

1538
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So it's you know going into this movie

1539
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You're thinking ponies ponies ponies ponies

1540
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Four legs four legs two legs

1541
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Contrast right that's why I like the whole

1542
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
On an adventure thing it's like what the fuck is this

1543
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Disney cat I sure as hell

1544
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Feel like I we're not in equestria anymore

1545
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Right that's the whole reason I like that whole scene

1546
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Right of the contrast and also a nice

1547
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Directing technique that was so well done

1548
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You probably never noticed it

1549
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I feel like weird characters like that show up in equestria

1550
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Well the level of contrast

1551
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Was what I wanted out of a cinematic experience

1552
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Right so then the whole adventure

1553
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Up to the point that they get to the sea pony realm

1554
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
They're going from left to right

1555
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The whole time ah nice you know

1556
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You always feel like you're going further and further away

1557
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Then when they go back they're going to the left

1558
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Again I went into it with ok episode

1559
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But it's cinematic it did the fuck out of that

1560
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
If it just had good songs

1561
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And didn't have a stupid twilight fucks up

1562
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And everyone hates it for five minutes thing

1563
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That was the worst thing

1564
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That was hilarious

1565
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You took this win for my sales

1566
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I can't believe

1567
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I want to

1568
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Twilight would resort to fucking theft

1569
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
That was the stupidest fucking bullshit

1570
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Conflict and it happened

1571
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I checked out of the whole movie

1572
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Hold on hold on

1573
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I want to challenge Davoo's premise

1574
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Of the fact that we were like

1575
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That we're watching it wrong by nitpicking it to death

1576
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Because Davoo but as you said

1577
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
If we watch this it's just an episode of the show

1578
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And the question is why are we watching my little pony

1579
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So the only justification for watching

1580
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
This movie is that we're going to do a podcast

1581
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
About it where we bitch about it incessantly

1582
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's the joke

1583
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That is why we're here

1584
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
In the MLP analysis community

1585
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Are we going to all watch the MLP movie

1586
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And get into a podcast

1587
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And go well you know it was fine for what it is

1588
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And then roll credits like

1589
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Where's the podcast if we do that

1590
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I just think I optimized my fucking viewing experience

1591
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Well

1592
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm going to say that I did not

1593
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I was not looking for nitpicking

1594
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh do I like this thing properly

1595
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Just like it or don't

1596
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm going to record that I have a drag kicking and screaming

1597
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And coming up with an OC

1598
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Like refers to me by it

1599
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
After I was

1600
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm sorry

1601
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We have been around for years

1602
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You just came out with it

1603
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You can't expect us to be on board instantly

1604
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You can't be dragged into this episode

1605
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I was like why do I need to be on this episode

1606
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I never did pony analysis and Nate was like

1607
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
No you have to do it

1608
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm sorry

1609
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
We're so fucking sorry that you had to be here

1610
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Alright who cares

1611
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Gib was saying something go ahead

1612
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I was going to say in responding to

1613
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Like the thing Davoo said about the cinematic

1614
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Camera movement

1615
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Directing

1616
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I actually remember like multiple moments

1617
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Where I'm like oh that's neat

1618
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That's a cool camera move

1619
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's a cool special like

1620
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
They did that very well

1621
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The backgrounds and the camera and the directing

1622
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Was actually really good the whole way through

1623
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The scene where the pirate ship gets attacked

1624
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They did like shaky cam for a while

1625
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That was interesting

1626
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It did really like

1627
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's in a terrible part of the movie

1628
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's when Twilight is sad and she's sitting on the rock

1629
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
In like a mist

1630
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
That scene looked really cool and was framed really well

1631
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I want to point out

1632
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I've talked about this in one of my videos before

1633
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But when you do shaky cam in animation

1634
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
That necessarily means that they have animated

1635
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Beyond the parameters of the frame

1636
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And are shaking a camera through it

1637
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Which I always think is interesting

1638
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Because you think of it

1639
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
As just they're shaking a camera

1640
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Then when you think about the fact that it's all hand drawn

1641
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's like wait what is the camera pointing at

1642
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh right

1643
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And as we kind of know earlier

1644
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The scene where a chip

1645
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
A horn kicks the shit out of that

1646
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
One guy random goon

1647
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
In the fucking town

1648
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And it's this awesome like four part single shot

1649
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Take down

1650
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That was a cool moment

1651
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah I love Simba

1652
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I love

1653
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Tom

1654
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
You're saying something

1655
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I just wanted to point out something

1656
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I thought it was really funny how this whole movie

1657
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Can just boil down to Twilight forgets

1658
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So you can teleport the movie

1659
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah I was going to bring that up

1660
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
She's like trapped in this fucking cage

1661
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And I'm just like bitch

1662
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh my fucking god

1663
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
To be fair

1664
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
There was some weird stuff going on

1665
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Where it was shown that the shields

1666
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Those guys seemed to be using seemed pretty resistant to magic

1667
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But you wouldn't use the magic on that

1668
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You just pop away

1669
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Maybe there was a magical field

1670
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
What would be the comment

1671
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
On Tom's video

1672
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Fuck you

1673
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Okay watching this

1674
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I want to talk about the most interesting aspect of watching the movie to me

1675
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Like completely

1676
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Unrelated to the actual quality of the film

1677
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
What was the most interesting to me

1678
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
As I watched this was I could see

1679
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
All the fan art

1680
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I could hear the fan songs

1681
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Like I could hear the remixes

1682
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I could hear the lines that would become memes

1683
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
There's the scene

1684
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I could see the porn

1685
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
The scene where like a cake falls on

1686
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Like a, was it Twilight or Pinky

1687
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And like on Twilight and like all of its

1688
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Dripping off of her and stuff

1689
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Like all this white liquid is

1690
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
You're projectively dripping off of her

1691
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Dude

1692
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There would have been porn of that scene

1693
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
There would have been

1694
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
There's the energy

1695
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I mean actually there might be

1696
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I haven't checked but like

1697
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
If they weren't all herded into a room at Dashcon

1698
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And assassinated

1699
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't know how

1700
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Active the community is right now

1701
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
But like I could hear

1702
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
There was like one song that

1703
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Because as

1704
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Equity pointed out in the

1705
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
What was the name of the

1706
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
T.V.S.S.B.P

1707
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Two very special sunpony

1708
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
As the very special sunponies

1709
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Pointed out

1710
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
While I unlike Equity

1711
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Do like a lot of the songs of the show

1712
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
They are almost the exact same song

1713
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They all use the same chord progressions

1714
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And there was a song in this movie that did that

1715
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And because of that I could hear the remixes

1716
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Like I could hear where the beats would

1717
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Fall and everything and it was really trippy

1718
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
For me as somebody who consumed

1719
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Probably more fan content of MLP

1720
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Than any other human on earth

1721
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm willing to be forgiving of the songs

1722
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
For being all pretty similar in structure

1723
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Because like this is MLP we're talking about

1724
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
This is a kids movie that we don't need

1725
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They just were also not good

1726
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Because the hooks were bad

1727
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's a separate issue

1728
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The good songs from old MLP

1729
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Were still simple

1730
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
The way I've always seen the music

1731
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I mean this is just sort of the way

1732
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I listen to music in general

1733
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Is that I like the instrumentality

1734
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
More so than the chord progression

1735
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't pay attention to what chords are being played

1736
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I like

1737
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The instruments being used

1738
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And the melodies that are going along

1739
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
With them and it's like oh that's really cool

1740
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
A little Spanish guitar bit

1741
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I like that in a thing

1742
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I liked all the songs because

1743
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Regardless of how similar

1744
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They are to other songs in MLP

1745
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
They got good instruments

1746
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And Daniel Ingram is good at that

1747
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I think

1748
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Gibbon I'm going to shave you

1749
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm going to groom you

1750
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Hey let me tell you

1751
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
My favorite thing about this movie too

1752
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
My favorite thing was

1753
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
When Twilight reveals herself

1754
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
To be literally friendship challenged

1755
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So her friends were all

1756
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You know, entertaining

1757
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
The princess or whatever

1758
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And it is in fact revealed that Twilight is like

1759
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Having Twilight be the princess of friendship

1760
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Is like hiring someone with Down syndrome

1761
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
To be the head of Homeland Security

1762
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
They could be a fine person

1763
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But they're just not right for the job

1764
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No justification for that scene

1765
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's unbelievable

1766
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What are you talking about when she steals the ore

1767
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I can't imagine

1768
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Just like in Dungeon Crawlstone's soup

1769
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'm just pointing out another moment

1770
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Where she forgets she could teleport

1771
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm just saying, I'm just throwing that one out there

1772
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
At the very beginning of the song

1773
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
She's trying to get away from the guys

1774
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The princesses just did nothing

1775
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
By the way, they did not move

1776
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
They did not say go away

1777
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
How fucking annoying was it

1778
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
When Derpy was the one that jumped in front of the bullet

1779
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And took the bullet to her

1780
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I was so confused by that

1781
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Did the rainbow swoop in the saber

1782
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Did she replace Twilight?

1783
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I guess that's what happened

1784
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I was very confused by that

1785
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Because you see Rainbow fly in and grab her

1786
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
No, you cut away too fast

1787
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You see Derpy for a few seconds

1788
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Just before when it's zooming in on Twilight

1789
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You can see Derpy at the bottom left corner

1790
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Is she just behind her or something?

1791
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
No, I remember specifically

1792
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It was confusing

1793
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But I did piece together that it was Derpy

1794
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Just because it cut away too fast

1795
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I knew there was a joke there

1796
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But I just needed one quarter of a second longer

1797
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
To process what happened

1798
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But I cut away, fuck you, I'm not reminding

1799
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Speaking of that

1800
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Things dragged too long

1801
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
There was weird, awkward, long transitions

1802
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Between scenes that really bothered me

1803
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Maybe it's a cinematic thing

1804
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I guess we kind of talked about this a little bit

1805
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But the fact that once again

1806
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The three princesses are fucking useless

1807
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
This is the setting

1808
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
To really show them off

1809
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And do something cool with them finally

1810
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But to be instantly again

1811
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Relegated to nothing

1812
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In the first 20 minutes

1813
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's so fucking stock

1814
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And it pisses me off

1815
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Why the fuck is the villain so intimidating?

1816
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
What is the basis of his power?

1817
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Because all he seems to have was the staff

1818
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
That is established that fucking Tempest

1819
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Gave to him

1820
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Right

1821
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I guess he just had a really good marketing campaign

1822
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But don't you think it's kind of retarded too

1823
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The fact that this character Tempest

1824
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Like why wasn't she the big bad

1825
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because her whole point is that

1826
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I don't trust anybody anymore

1827
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But then trust this guy to do what he says

1828
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So it just makes her look retarded

1829
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And she was right, she was right now trusting one

1830
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Because he didn't do what he said he was going to do

1831
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
So she was right

1832
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
That's literally the fucking story with Tyric

1833
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
She is Discord and he is Tyric

1834
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And also like she's like way too competent

1835
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
To be his underling

1836
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
She did every single thing for him

1837
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
She did everything

1838
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It's so dumb

1839
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
There was some promise here

1840
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That all hinges on that he had the unique ability

1841
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
To heal her horn

1842
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But no, anyone who had the staff

1843
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Anyone who held the staff would have had the exact same power

1844
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't think that's true because even though

1845
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Twilight has the staff at the end

1846
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
She still doesn't heal her

1847
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm thinking that maybe that the staff

1848
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Actually let her do that

1849
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Because it gave him power over the sky

1850
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But none of the princesses have healing powers

1851
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Except Caden's

1852
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But that's the thing

1853
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This is the issue I'm talking about

1854
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Why would she agree to be his servant

1855
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Before he gets the staff

1856
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And then bring him the staff

1857
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
If like he

1858
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Why didn't she just do it herself

1859
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That's very true

1860
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And very stupid

1861
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
What exactly did he bring to the table for

1862
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I mean that's like that's the pain

1863
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I guess the troops

1864
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I guess he gave her the troops

1865
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That's the general bad guy logic though

1866
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Did she need the troops though the whole time

1867
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
She just fucking steamrolls everybody

1868
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
When she got in with him

1869
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Maybe he picked her up as a little orphan

1870
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Nobody likes you but I'll train you to be a child soldier

1871
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
You didn't see him as established

1872
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yeah

1873
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That's some headcanon there

1874
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's some incorice territory

1875
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That's fucking way

1876
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Then what does it matter

1877
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Since we're talking about this

1878
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I did want to say

1879
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
My favorite part of the episode

1880
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
There's a brief moment during the assault

1881
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
When they're raiding the place

1882
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Fluttershy

1883
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Fluttershy

1884
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
They're all fighting one

1885
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Fluttershy calmly

1886
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Acts like a psychiatrist

1887
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Or a psychologist to one of the troops

1888
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That's how she takes it out

1889
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That was my favorite moment

1890
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
By the way

1891
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Who else felt it was a huge relief

1892
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
When they did the

1893
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Like the discord balloon at the beginning

1894
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And that to me was a signal

1895
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
He would not be in the movie and I was like

1896
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Oh thank god

1897
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Speaking about the villains and shit

1898
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
So okay

1899
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Wait a minute where was he

1900
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Why didn't they fucking get him

1901
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The magic in this whole show is kind of broken

1902
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Phantom hard

1903
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Discord

1904
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Discord isn't in the movie

1905
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Because this script must have been written forever ago

1906
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Because Starlight wasn't in the movie either

1907
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
And she's one of the main characters now

1908
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So they just kind of crammed everybody into the movie

1909
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm assuming this script was written years ago

1910
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Right after season 4

1911
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That's where I would say it takes place

1912
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
In the timeline

1913
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I didn't even think about it

1914
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
But the conspicuous absence of discord

1915
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Is like a huge fucking deal breaker

1916
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So here's what's happening

1917
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Canterlot was sieged

1918
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And now that's under attack

1919
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
But the rest of Equestria is still fine

1920
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Why did that go on?

1921
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's not like the entire population was fucking obliterated

1922
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
They could go back to Ponyville

1923
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They could go back to fucking

1924
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Wherever there is

1925
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Go get your friendship nuke

1926
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Use the friendship nuke

1927
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Why didn't they use the tree?

1928
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Remember when there were Native Americans in My Little Pony

1929
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I do

1930
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Don't reveal the trail of tears

1931
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Even leaving didn't even matter

1932
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
They could have finished

1933
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Solved everything right in the beginning

1934
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Because they go on this huge big quest

1935
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
To get this orb that does nothing

1936
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And all they do is get the princess to help them

1937
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And she does literally enough to

1938
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
In the end they just beat up the bad guys

1939
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's really smooth

1940
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
How do you guys all feel about the fact that somebody

1941
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Fucking died

1942
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Dude

1943
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I almost forgot

1944
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
That was fucking insane

1945
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Has this happened

1946
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And then they play with this fucking corpse

1947
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I do

1948
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Guys

1949
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Guys though

1950
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Did you watch the credits though

1951
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
In the credits

1952
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
In the credits

1953
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
His eyes move so it implies

1954
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
He's still alive

1955
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Are you kidding me

1956
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That ruins the only good part of this movie

1957
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I know

1958
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That's even worse

1959
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That's even worse because he's eternally

1960
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Severed

1961
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
He's like that guy in Jojo

1962
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
He's like that guy in Jojo that Josuke

1963
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Put in the rocks

1964
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah

1965
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
The show

1966
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Was anybody else actually like a little

1967
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Shook by that

1968
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
That like a straight up murder happened

1969
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It was an accident

1970
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I was just thinking about

1971
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But the fact that an onscreen death

1972
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Occurred

1973
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I believe Sombra was killed

1974
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I think Sombra did die

1975
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It wasn't very graphic though

1976
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
This was like

1977
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
They show a shard

1978
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
A shard of Storm King's head

1979
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Slide across the ground

1980
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I hate to bring this up again

1981
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But don't you think that's another

1982
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Disney trope that they ate

1983
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The villain dies

1984
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The villain dies by falling and it's not exactly anyone's fault

1985
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That's the funny thing about it

1986
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I kind of thought it was

1987
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
inappropriate for the villain to

1988
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Die horribly in a My Little Pony movie

1989
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It was a little weird

1990
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
A movie that has no mistakes

1991
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And where most of it

1992
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
The villain's like a goofy dude

1993
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
He doesn't come across as like

1994
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
A violently evil

1995
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
He didn't kill anybody

1996
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Friendship is magic but you

1997
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Cross your fucking dead

1998
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I just played

1999
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Cuphead

2000
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Which has me thinking about all the horrible

2001
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Fucked up things that used to happen in cartoons

2002
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And I want more of that

2003
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I want so much death in my cartoons

2004
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It's not that it was weird in this movie

2005
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Where like nothing that bad

2006
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Like in the case of

2007
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Sombra

2008
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm pretty sure he does die

2009
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Phantom

2010
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It's like obliterated

2011
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And he's like evaporated

2012
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
But Sombra was a much

2013
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Bigger threat though than this dude

2014
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Sombra was just an angry

2015
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Evil guy who like

2016
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Turned everybody to crystal and was like

2017
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Another problem with the movie is that the

2018
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Stakes are already too fucking hot

2019
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
The only way to have a movie that would actually be

2020
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Significantly more epic is if it was like

2021
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
End of Iqwan Gelyon and where like everything's all abstract

2022
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I love that

2023
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I love that movie

2024
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
What I was thinking about when I saw that

2025
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Was I really started running for my money

2026
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That's a great line

2027
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It all returns to Muffins

2028
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Coming down

2029
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Coming down

2030
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That's perfect

2031
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Because it's a really inappropriate word

2032
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And that's exactly what a pony remix

2033
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Of that song would be

2034
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
When that guy died though

2035
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
My mind started racing about the board meeting

2036
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That must have happened where they were discussing like

2037
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
What context is it acceptable to have a character

2038
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Actually die in

2039
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
First of all he's frozen into stone

2040
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So that he can shatter and no one actually does

2041
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Anything to him too

2042
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
He has to like be like Ben was saying

2043
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Anyone's fault

2044
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
He dies exactly like Gaston

2045
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Like his aggressive action

2046
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Is what ultimately causes

2047
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Even though I'm sure Twilight could have easily

2048
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Fucking targeted him too on that hovering

2049
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yeah

2050
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Like that guy he had no powers

2051
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
He just had a staff

2052
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And then he loses the staff

2053
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Why did they just fucking kill him when he lost the staff

2054
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Had just random fucking bubble gum

2055
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
God mode killer gum

2056
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That just turns people to stone

2057
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Like they are

2058
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Plus

2059
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Even when he had the staff that one time

2060
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
She faces off with him head to head

2061
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And they prove to be like an even fucking match

2062
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Him with the powered up staff

2063
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
What the fuck

2064
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That fucking obliterated everyone

2065
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And they did not even try

2066
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That incredible

2067
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I didn't even think about that

2068
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I wonder if you could do a cut

2069
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Of this movie where it's the beginning

2070
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Where he gets the staff

2071
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You cut the entire middle of the movie

2072
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And it just cuts to the assault

2073
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And nothing really of value would be lost

2074
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm going into head canon now

2075
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But maybe it's like breaking the horn

2076
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Didn't rob her of her power

2077
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Of the ability to control it

2078
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So her power is coming out raw

2079
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And unfiltered now

2080
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
She loses magic all over the movie

2081
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Her tone works

2082
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It only works

2083
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
For that one specific thing

2084
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Which is funnily enough

2085
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Her super special

2086
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
She's Fizzle Pop Sparkle Butter

2087
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It was Fizzle Pop Berry Twist

2088
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Fizzle Pop Berry Twist

2089
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So I assume that her fireworks were going to be

2090
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Her super special talent anyway

2091
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So the fact that her horn breaking

2092
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Includes all magic other than that one thing

2093
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
She was destined to be good at

2094
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It's pretty neat, but I guess that's just equestrian destiny

2095
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
In action

2096
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Since we're talking about the staff

2097
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Why do the princesses in their castle

2098
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Have this one thing

2099
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Where you put the staff in

2100
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
They can rob them of their powers

2101
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't fucking know

2102
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It was a slot for this staff

2103
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
He had the staff

2104
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
He brought the staff with him

2105
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Maybe they built that

2106
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
In the week that they had

2107
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
After the ponies

2108
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
If you have to head canon away it wasn't written well

2109
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You mean three days canonically

2110
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Three days canonically

2111
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Maybe in three days they carved out the mystic sigils

2112
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Required for the ceremony

2113
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That you just said could have been so helpful

2114
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Over the years

2115
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
If you have to head canon it's not good writing

2116
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That could have saved us so much

2117
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I just figured it goes without

2118
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Fucking saying

2119
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
But every time you bring that up you get fucking shit on

2120
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So fuck you

2121
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Well head canoning is fun

2122
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It is fun, but it's fun

2123
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But it's not a defensive shit

2124
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Writing

2125
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm not sure we should really listen to anything that tall tales

2126
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Known denouncer and lever of the

2127
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
fandom has to say about this

2128
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I never left the fandom

2129
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I'm still here guys

2130
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm looking for life

2131
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I'm still here guys

2132
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Alive and kicking

2133
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Here's what you don't understand about the storm king and his

2134
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
His ilk

2135
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So immediately once he captured everyone

2136
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
We learned about this guy named storm king

2137
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Never heard about him before

2138
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
The princesses act like they don't know who the fuck this is

2139
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Then we leave Equestria and immediately

2140
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
We're in his territory

2141
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
All of these locations

2142
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
The pirates are his control

2143
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And the hippogriffs are completely

2144
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Outrun and completely obliterated

2145
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
The ponies are extremely nationalistic and isolationist

2146
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Don't you find it retarded though

2147
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
That everybody's been fucked over

2148
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
By this guy

2149
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
But as soon

2150
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
As soon as we're in trouble

2151
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
We're gonna go get help

2152
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Yeah

2153
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
That's exactly what I was thinking

2154
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
First they came for the griffons and I did nothing

2155
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
For the pirates

2156
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Then they came for me and there was no one to help me

2157
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
But I could actually

2158
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Okay

2159
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Did you notice

2160
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The subtle, not subtle

2161
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Blading, racist undertones

2162
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Twilight explicitly wanted to establish an ethno state

2163
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Within this My Little Pony movie

2164
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
She keeps saying we can't trust conars

2165
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Quote unquote

2166
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
We can't trust pirates

2167
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Come out and say Twilight

2168
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You ain't furries

2169
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You're a pony just like me

2170
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Tempest, I don't understand why you aren't on my side

2171
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You're a pony just like me

2172
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
What's going on here

2173
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Did you find it a little bit racist

2174
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
When Rainbow Dash is saying

2175
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
This cloven hoove motherfucker over here

2176
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh my god

2177
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Is there some shit here I'm not aware of

2178
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Nothing gets my big blue

2179
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Horstic rock heart

2180
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Than pony racism

2181
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I'm not even joking

2182
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I love that

2183
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
She just owns all this land

2184
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
The hippo grips who

2185
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Was specifically saying to contact

2186
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Have been already overrun

2187
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So like what was the plan here

2188
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Not even overrun

2189
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Not even overrun but like it's been like

2190
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Who even knows how long

2191
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Since this happened

2192
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
The city has been there a while

2193
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And Celestia didn't know shit

2194
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
She didn't know shit

2195
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
She's in character

2196
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Full disclosure I did not watch this entire movie

2197
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh my fucking god

2198
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
After the sea pony scene

2199
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And then everybody getting mad

2200
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
At each other and splitting up

2201
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That was where I started hitting the forward button

2202
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That's where I wanted to hit the forward button

2203
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But I watched about

2204
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I watched like a couple seconds of every

2205
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Five seconds of the rest of the movie

2206
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because I thought there was a new video digi

2207
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That you made recently called Thoroughly Analyzing Ponyo

2208
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And you talked about how you don't

2209
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Like those kinds of scenes in movies

2210
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And I can completely respect skipping it

2211
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
There yes

2212
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Because it was just

2213
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Twilight's trying to see the pearl

2214
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Was super obnoxious and as soon as the scene started

2215
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I went oh here we go

2216
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
They're all going to be mad at each other

2217
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And here's what I predicted and I was completely right

2218
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
They will not have to resolve this

2219
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It will just resolve itself

2220
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Twilight will be captured

2221
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And they'll all come to help her

2222
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It won't be that

2223
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
They have to have a conversation about

2224
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
What she did wrong or anything like that

2225
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
She's going to get in trouble

2226
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
They're going to help her and none of this will have meant anything

2227
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
We just presume

2228
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We just presume that Twilight has learned

2229
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Something in all of this

2230
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
There's no confirmation of that

2231
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And she would do it again

2232
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
She says

2233
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Friendship didn't fail me

2234
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I failed friendship

2235
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Okay what does that mean

2236
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Shouldn't she be demoted

2237
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Shouldn't those wings go away

2238
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
He should definitely have to go on a pilgrimage

2239
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
How many times does Twilight get to learn this lesson

2240
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Before we just say you're broken

2241
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Your most popular video

2242
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Theories on

2243
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Alicorn Princess Twilight Sparkle

2244
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Your most popular video

2245
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You talk about how she earns her wings

2246
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
In the episode where she didn't even need

2247
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
To learn anything about friendship

2248
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
She intuitively fucking got it

2249
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Now the rewrite for this lowest point

2250
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Scene would be simple AF

2251
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
They do the song

2252
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Twilight's part of the song to the sea ponies

2253
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Great job convincing them

2254
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And then the queen is all like this is a fun song

2255
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But wait you're just trying to manipulate me

2256
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I hate you go away and then they're all

2257
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Super bummed because they thought they were being really nice

2258
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And they were extending a hand of friendship

2259
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And they got smacked back down

2260
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And maybe you could even have Twilight get a little bit agitated

2261
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
That all of her learnings about friendship

2262
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Didn't work this time

2263
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And she could still have a little bit of a kerfuffle with her friends

2264
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Not really ideal but you can still

2265
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Wax it in there if you need it to

2266
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And that's it she could still be

2267
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
A friendship intuitive as she was

2268
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And she learns that she has to

2269
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
If she wants to do the job right

2270
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
She has to steal and kill

2271
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Twilight at that point

2272
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And then she goes and kills the bad

2273
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Twilight at that point becomes a

2274
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
She learns the lesson of becoming a race realist

2275
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And realizing that the race realist

2276
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Will simply not be able to

2277
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Understand her high level pony friendship

2278
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Because they are lower beings

2279
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
That's awesome a race realist

2280
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's a good one

2281
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And a new

2282
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
A new race realist is born

2283
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's a affirmed race realist

2284
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Fucking Twilight

2285
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Manipulates her friends

2286
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Straight out just like

2287
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Does not tell them the plan

2288
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
She could just tell them

2289
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Her plan and they would like

2290
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Talk about like friends

2291
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Because they're not evil like Twilight

2292
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
They're not smart enough

2293
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
They're not smart enough

2294
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Like the prince of thieves

2295
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Wait no Aladdin and the king of thieves

2296
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
These naive ponies

2297
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Still naively trust in the power

2298
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Of friendship when Twilight has seen

2299
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The error of her ways because the cat man

2300
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Would mean to them

2301
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
With becoming the princess of friendship

2302
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
She has now got an actual state position

2303
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And it is now her responsibility to look at

2304
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
For the well being of the entire kingdom

2305
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
She does say that in the beginning of the movie herself

2306
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
That inherently puts actual friendship

2307
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
On a lower level

2308
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That's not the fucking theme to the whole franchise

2309
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So now it's not her priority

2310
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It's not her highest priority anymore

2311
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I'm about to drop a bombshell

2312
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's gonna completely hijack this conversation

2313
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
For the next 35 minutes

2314
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I'm either gonna

2315
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm either gonna be jeered

2316
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Or I'm gonna be peered

2317
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I might be knocked down

2318
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I might be saddled up

2319
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I might be plumped up

2320
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Some of you guys might hold me like 6 feet above water

2321
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And boil me, steam me, break up my carapace

2322
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You guys might groom me

2323
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Twilight, can we

2324
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
We've been out of this fandom

2325
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
For God knows how long we've been

2326
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Can we please stop pretending

2327
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Can we please just be on for ourselves

2328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Twilight being a princess was always a bad idea

2329
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And it was never cool

2330
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Can we please stop pretending that it was

2331
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I have always said from the very beginning

2332
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
That Twilight becoming a princess should have been

2333
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
The last episode of my movie

2334
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Agreed, yeah for sure

2335
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I mean I'm gonna disagree with that

2336
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Not to even bring up the fact that

2337
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It doesn't make any sense

2338
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I mean I think it's okay

2339
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I think it's cool but there's just a million ways

2340
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It could have been done better which I believe

2341
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I know Digi was pretty positive about it

2342
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
At the time

2343
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't see any reason it can't happen

2344
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I enjoyed the episode

2345
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The logic behind it is totally fucking

2346
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Totally fucking opaque

2347
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I used to say

2348
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Even at the time that I think it should have happened

2349
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
At the end of season 4

2350
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Because there should have been an arc

2351
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Like season 4 feels like

2352
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The arc leading up to her becoming princess

2353
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like when you see the way

2354
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That people react to her the way she's not really treated

2355
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Like a princess that season

2356
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And the way people react to her is like

2357
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
She's someone important now but not quite

2358
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
There should have been an arc about her becoming like famous

2359
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Or like known as a problem

2360
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Solver and like people are coming to her

2361
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And as she solves friendship problems

2362
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Around Equestria she eventually

2363
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Is granted princess status

2364
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Maybe establish that that's a thing that can

2365
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Happen before springing it on you

2366
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Out of nowhere

2367
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
The thing that I never liked about

2368
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
The princess thing with the wings

2369
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Is that

2370
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah it was Celestia and Luna

2371
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And that's it

2372
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And they were like super special

2373
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
They erased the sun and the moon

2374
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And then you can just become one

2375
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And then there's Caden

2376
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
This was my argument back in the day

2377
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
They've become less and less interesting

2378
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And the lore becomes more and more convoluted

2379
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And it's very clear that being a princess

2380
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Doesn't mean you

2381
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Solved like you're very good at it

2382
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It just means that you're

2383
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Well that's something

2384
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
My problem with

2385
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
We're getting in some deep shit

2386
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I think it would have been

2387
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Easily possible to make

2388
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Twilight becoming a princess make sense

2389
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
In the narrative and everything

2390
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I just think that it was not

2391
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It was jumped the gun because of the mandate

2392
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
From Hasbro to Duke

2393
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
To kind of work the series around it

2394
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And it's not until season 5 that it starts making sense

2395
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Where she actually is treated like a princess

2396
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It's amazing to think now

2397
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
That Twilight has been a princess longer than she has

2398
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Not been

2399
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So my problem with Twilight as an Alicorn

2400
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Is that it means that the main six only has

2401
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
One unicorn now

2402
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And look

2403
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
That's my problem too

2404
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Right no no no

2405
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
As we all know

2406
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
This might be good information

2407
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The appeal of MLP is encased in autism

2408
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
As you

2409
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I know maybe some people have heard of it

2410
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
We all

2411
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You have to chip away the autism

2412
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
To get to the My Little Pony goodness

2413
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I would say that there is

2414
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
If you had a Venn diagram

2415
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Of autism and My Little Pony fans

2416
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's almost just a circle

2417
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Right no no no

2418
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
We are all

2419
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Dead in the middle of that

2420
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And we're the only ones

2421
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
On the edge

2422
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I am in the middle of that

2423
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
The main six, most of the ponies

2424
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
They all have the same basic character shape

2425
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
With some slight differences, different color palettes

2426
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Sonic the Hedgehog is the same

2427
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
The sort of symmetry is pleasing

2428
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
To the autistic eye

2429
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And two unicorns, two earth ponies

2430
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And two Pegasus high

2431
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Means there's this nice

2432
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Symmetry that's very pleasing

2433
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And it's really triggering my autism

2434
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
That they changed it

2435
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I totally agree

2436
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
If you read the

2437
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Very first analysis I ever wrote about MLP

2438
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
My argument is essentially

2439
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That even though the show

2440
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Is all flash animation and stock stuff

2441
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That is the appeal

2442
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That it's so

2443
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Samey that it's such a clear

2444
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You can understand it

2445
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
At a glance

2446
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And you can make your own

2447
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
You can inject your own because it's so easy

2448
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's such a template

2449
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It's so popular for autistic people

2450
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Because it's all

2451
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's like

2452
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
What the fuck

2453
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It's like you said

2454
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm seeing all the ones and zeros

2455
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
In the show

2456
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
When you look at the animation now

2457
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I think that's what we all kind of did

2458
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
From the start

2459
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
You like the ones and zeros

2460
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You want to play around with them

2461
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Autism programming

2462
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It's all a rich tapestry

2463
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
We're all in the spectrum

2464
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's all a rich tapestry that we use

2465
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
To weave into a giant pressure blanket

2466
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
That we use to get to sleep at night

2467
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I don't know if you guys feel the same way

2468
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But the locations in this movie

2469
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
We're all fucking horrible

2470
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Like okay

2471
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And my little pony things are clean

2472
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And colorful

2473
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
When they go to a completely generic

2474
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Dundadeth all one color

2475
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Brown sandy literal star war

2476
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Common fucking corporate

2477
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That's what they were going for

2478
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
You know Munchy, I was really upset

2479
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Because

2480
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
When they show that kingdom from the distance

2481
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It looks awesome

2482
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
The image from a distance looks really cool

2483
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And I was excited because it made me think of how

2484
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
The worst thing about

2485
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Episode one of season five

2486
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Was when they go to that town that just looks like

2487
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Shit, it's just nothing

2488
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And it was like the most unmemorable location

2489
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
In the whole fucking show

2490
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And that had really bothered me at the time

2491
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Oh hey, it's like the art design that I expect from the show

2492
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And then they go there and it's just a generic

2493
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Um, yeah

2494
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like bizarre and I was like oh it's one of these

2495
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's all one color

2496
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's all exactly one mid-tone color

2497
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You're not wrong

2498
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And even when they get to cool locations like the underwater area

2499
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And the last locations like that too

2500
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Well like the underwater location

2501
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The sea pony place sucked

2502
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Hold on

2503
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'm talking about the top of the mountain

2504
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Was all gray

2505
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And then when they go and they're all sad

2506
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And they're like twilight, you're mean

2507
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And she's like yeah I am, it's all gray as well

2508
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It's all gray

2509
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That movie is weirdly gray

2510
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
That is the trope of the breaking up the friend scene

2511
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Is that it's a gray place

2512
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Like if you watch all those Disney movies

2513
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's always in a gray location

2514
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
There was definitely an element

2515
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Of juxtaposing the pastelness

2516
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Of the ponies with like drabness

2517
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Of these other environments

2518
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Especially the ones outside of Equestria

2519
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
All drab and it makes me want to die

2520
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Because it sucks

2521
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Wasn't the underwater place

2522
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Pretty cool

2523
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I don't know where the other one is

2524
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The throne room, you know

2525
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
The throne room, not only is it that

2526
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It's just the throne room

2527
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But also that the throne room is literally copy-pasted

2528
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
From the little mermaid

2529
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
It's just the same place

2530
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Where's what you heard about the mermaid?

2531
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I liked the

2532
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
The song montage done

2533
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
When they were in the water place

2534
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Was enough to endear me to that place

2535
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I went to the bathroom to bring that song

2536
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Because I was sick of hearing songs

2537
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
You watched the torrent

2538
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
There's a pause button, what's wrong with you

2539
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
No, I wanted to make

2540
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I wanted to not have to watch it

2541
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So I went, oh, they're singing

2542
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Great, let me get up and go get a drink

2543
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So that I don't have to watch it

2544
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh, that didgy brony

2545
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
The integrity of all of your analysis work

2546
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Is now completely fucked

2547
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
The word you say

2548
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You shouldn't have in the first place

2549
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I've never had integrity

2550
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
That's why I put God's own channel

2551
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
We've been glossing over

2552
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
A part of the movie, which if you watched the trailer

2553
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
You could have assumed it was a big part of the movie

2554
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
But in actuality, it wasn't

2555
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That one celebrity appearance was literally completely meaningless

2556
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I was gonna bring that up

2557
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
She only had like three lines

2558
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Literally just to trick people to see the movie

2559
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But it didn't work because I don't have no clue

2560
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
She's just some Stacy

2561
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I like her hair

2562
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Okay, okay, her speaking voice

2563
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Her speaking voice is so soft

2564
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Genuine, you're not kidding anyone

2565
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We know you're mean, we know you're awful

2566
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Because you're a celebrity and they're all bad

2567
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
We're not kidding anyone

2568
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We know you're bad, we know it

2569
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
What she's famous for

2570
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Is that she's an anti-celebrity

2571
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
No one knows what she looks like

2572
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
She's like a hidden

2573
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
She writes the biggest pop songs in the world

2574
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
But she's never revealed herself

2575
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And nobody knows anything about her

2576
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Is that why her face was covered by all this hair

2577
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Yeah, that's actually what she looks like

2578
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
In real life, she has the

2579
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Didn't you know the

2580
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Swinging on the chandelier song with the little girl who dances

2581
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And it's like the butterflies

2582
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Do you honestly think I have any connection

2583
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
To pop culture beyond my little pony at all

2584
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Anybody know what the fuck this is

2585
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I watched the music video for

2586
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Tom, there's no way you haven't heard this song

2587
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Because it was like, I heard it

2588
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And I don't watch anything

2589
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Pop-related, but I don't know

2590
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You know way more about music than I do

2591
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Was it just like the ocean

2592
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Under the moon, you got the same

2593
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It was that

2594
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That's the one

2595
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That's Sia

2596
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I watched it

2597
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I watched certain that there was like a my little pony

2598
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Animation that allows this video

2599
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I watch Sia's cheap thrills music video

2600
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
All the time because I love it

2601
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
She's pretty cool

2602
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Wait, cheap thrills

2603
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Wait, cheap thrills

2604
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Up with it, girl

2605
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah, it's that fucking really gay shit

2606
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I don't know

2607
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Okay, let's not get too hung up on this

2608
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
The point is Sia was in it, she's a celebrity

2609
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
She sang a song, she was a character, she was okay

2610
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I didn't care

2611
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
She's actually a pony and that was her face

2612
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Oh, whoa

2613
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Wait, wait, wait, this is the canon Sia

2614
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
This is the actual one in the movie

2615
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
The human version, it's just an avatar

2616
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
She's communicating with the real world

2617
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Maybe we're all just characters

2618
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
In a show that the ponies are watching

2619
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
You guys ever think about that

2620
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It's like the Simpsons game for Xbox 360

2621
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But Sia, she's in the movie for no reason

2622
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Other than at the end

2623
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
They get to have the big concert

2624
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That's like, yeah, now we've resolved everything

2625
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
The fight gets to be that MC

2626
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Cause that's what he does and it's good time

2627
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I did not like it, but

2628
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I didn't dislike it, but Cheese Sandwich

2629
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Makes a cameo in this episode

2630
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And it just made me remember how amazing that was

2631
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
The Cheese Sandwich episode

2632
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
That's the perfect way to do it

2633
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
The point of the Sia character

2634
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
The point of the Sia character

2635
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Is just so that's why I could have a thing

2636
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
To talk about at the beginning, obviously

2637
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But I'm thinking, well, obviously

2638
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I thought immediately in the beginning of the movie

2639
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Well, at the end of the movie

2640
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Some sort of light show effect is going to happen

2641
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And it's going to be, well, not underwhelming

2642
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Cause I'm expecting it to be completely normal

2643
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And that's exactly what happened

2644
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Chip horn girl is like, I'm going to do

2645
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Fizzle Pop Man Twist

2646
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
He does a fucking magic and I'm like, alright

2647
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It's going to be a firework, it's going to be totally normal

2648
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And everyone is going to act like it's exceptional

2649
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And they boop boop, totally normal effect

2650
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And I'm like, yup, okay, you guys did it

2651
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You guys had a couple years to make the movie

2652
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You could have like actually made something that was like really

2653
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Surprisingly artistic

2654
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Dude, they had, they had Trixie already

2655
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
They could have used the fireworks

2656
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah, they could have used the fireworks

2657
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
This franchise has a long-stoyed history

2658
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Of ignoring Trixie's potential

2659
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And making new characters instead

2660
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
That's literally what I said to my boyfriend

2661
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
When we were watching, it was like

2662
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
They could have just used Trixie for the fireworks

2663
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
From the very beginning, Twilight could have

2664
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Just asked Trixie to do the fireworks

2665
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Trixie is in the movie

2666
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
The name of the game in this movie is

2667
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Redundancy, right?

2668
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
The name of this franchise is redundancy

2669
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I guess Twilight must have taken Trixie

2670
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Aside and been like, hey, I know

2671
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I know this was your bit, but just let

2672
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
That Fizzle Pop have this, like she needs a victory

2673
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Right now, like

2674
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Dude, I would kill to have that seed

2675
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I could see that happening in the show

2676
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I could totally see like

2677
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Random background quality being asked

2678
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
To step aside for someone else

2679
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That would totally happen in the show

2680
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And it would be hilarious

2681
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Speaking of scenes that were good

2682
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
My favorite part of the episode was the Dr. Wolf reference

2683
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
But other than that, my actual

2684
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Favorite bit in this movie

2685
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Was like, so there was

2686
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Twilight fucks everything up

2687
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The one who leads the charge

2688
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Telling her off and that she is fucked up

2689
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Is Pinkie Pie

2690
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Pinkie Pie actually filled

2691
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
A leadership role in that position

2692
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
As well as when they decide to go save Twilight

2693
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Because Pinkie is the one

2694
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
That's because Pinkie

2695
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
That's because Pinkie is the only written character

2696
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
In the movie

2697
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It would have felt very strange

2698
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
If Applejack, who makes more sense

2699
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
To be in that position, suddenly had something

2700
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
To do when she hasn't done anything

2701
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
When you start up the movie, you have this giant box

2702
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Of conceits in a giant package of library

2703
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
You got to accept all of them

2704
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
All six of them are going to be there the whole time

2705
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And mostly it's not going to matter

2706
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That's just what it's for

2707
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That's the same thing that happens with all these adventures

2708
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
That's always been a big problem

2709
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It's the Twilight show and her amazing friends

2710
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I think that there was space in this movie

2711
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
To give them all something to do

2712
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Of course that could be

2713
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I think they gave

2714
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I think they gave

2715
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
An exceptional amount of time to Pinkie Pie

2716
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Because she is the most popular character

2717
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
With little girls and she's Pink

2718
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And that's what Hasbro wants

2719
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Guys, do you think

2720
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
That in this situation of it being a movie

2721
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
They could have

2722
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Permanently killed Fluttershy and Applejack

2723
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
If they weren't going to use it

2724
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I was disappointed they didn't

2725
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
They get caught in the crossfire

2726
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
When the Thorn King falling

2727
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
They do some sort of weird fusion

2728
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Applejack and Rainbow Dash become one character

2729
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy

2730
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Also become one character

2731
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And the voice actors only have to

2732
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Have you ever noticed how

2733
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Rainbow Dash should have the element of honesty

2734
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And Applejack should have the element of honesty

2735
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Whoa

2736
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
The blow in my mind

2737
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
The elements are gone

2738
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Yeah, elements are irrelevant

2739
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
They are gone

2740
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Did anyone else find it

2741
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Slightly amusing when

2742
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Rarity was like

2743
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I wasn't raising a barn

2744
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Sorry Applejack

2745
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I laughed at that joke

2746
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Okay, I guess there were two jokes

2747
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
There were good jokes in the movie

2748
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Every joke in this movie

2749
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
You just forgot because everything after the first

2750
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
15 minutes

2751
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Those are the only two good ones

2752
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
There was one joke that I found funny

2753
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It really surprised me that one moment

2754
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
During the fight

2755
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Pinkie Pie

2756
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Gave a present

2757
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
To one of the girls like surprise

2758
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And then he opens the box and she pops out

2759
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Double surprise

2760
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I wasn't terrible

2761
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I found it amusing

2762
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
But then it's immediately ruined by the whole

2763
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Pinkie Pie throwing infinite cupcakes

2764
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
With that stupid face on her face

2765
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I was fine

2766
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I liked when she threw the first cupcake

2767
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And they made it look like a blood splatter

2768
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
On the wall behind him

2769
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
See

2770
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There are good things in this movie

2771
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
When the wind is whipping by

2772
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And the goons are getting hit with pies

2773
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It looks like they're being ripped apart

2774
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
By shrapnel

2775
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
The first thing I thought I was like

2776
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Holy shit

2777
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That's a very MLP thing to do

2778
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
They've done shit like that

2779
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
They always replicate

2780
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
A serious movie but in a goofy fun

2781
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Kitty way

2782
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I have a very important question for everybody

2783
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Was this better than

2784
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Girls

2785
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Unequivocally

2786
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I don't know

2787
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
How is this even a debate you guys question

2788
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But not better than Rainbow Rock

2789
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Just think back to that moment

2790
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
At the end with the whole battle against demons

2791
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
What's her face

2792
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Sunset

2793
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It was terrible

2794
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
It was better than

2795
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Equestria Girls 1 but not as good as

2796
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Rainbow Rock

2797
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Can't they just both be undesirable

2798
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Yeah

2799
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So firstly I quite liked

2800
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
The animation so I think

2801
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It's a lot better in the animation department

2802
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And cinematic stuff

2803
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I mean Equestria Girls looks like that

2804
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Writing wise

2805
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It's equally as bad

2806
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It's like the most basic fetch story

2807
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Quest without any sort of character arcs

2808
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
In it and lots of stupid stuff

2809
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Just crammed in just for the sake of being there

2810
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's such a poor writing

2811
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I completely agree

2812
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
The fact that all the other

2813
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
The songs

2814
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I think fail a lot more

2815
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Than any of the Equestria Girls songs

2816
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
As much as I dislike some of them

2817
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
They're at least earworms

2818
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And I quite enjoyed the villain songs

2819
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
In most Equestria Girls movies

2820
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Which I mean in this one

2821
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Not so much I don't remember it as

2822
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Quite as well as the any other ones

2823
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I'm definitely not good at

2824
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Equestria Girls Rainbow Rocks songs

2825
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Were not the right type

2826
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Of rock music

2827
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
There's not enough

2828
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I never saw

2829
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
The other Equestria Girls movies

2830
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
But based on

2831
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
There's only two right?

2832
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There's a bunch of them now

2833
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
They make one every year

2834
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
The third one's bad

2835
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
The second one's kinda good

2836
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
The fourth one is like

2837
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
In the camp

2838
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
In like a

2839
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Concentration camp

2840
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I remember

2841
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I remember being

2842
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
The guy who defended Equestria Girls

2843
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
You fool

2844
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Pretty colors dude

2845
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Pretty colors now

2846
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I definitely regret

2847
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
My position

2848
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I'm glad the history shows

2849
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I was right the entire time

2850
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Mostly because the movie

2851
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Is so insanely ugly

2852
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
That I cannot look at it anymore

2853
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
And I don't know the visuals

2854
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I just realized that

2855
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I don't know

2856
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I can't even look at the show anymore

2857
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I don't like

2858
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
My little pony friendship

2859
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Can we talk about that for a second?

2860
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That's a point that I was struggling going through

2861
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
The entire time watching this movie

2862
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And up to this podcast was that

2863
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I was trying to think of like

2864
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
How do I enjoy this movie now

2865
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Versus how would I have enjoyed this movie

2866
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
If it actually came out like six months after they announced it

2867
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Because this whole time

2868
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Experience in the fandom

2869
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
From 2012 to like

2870
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
2014 or 15 or whatever

2871
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I never understood why

2872
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I liked the show to begin with

2873
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I could never really quantify it in a way that made sense to me

2874
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And when I got out of it

2875
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I could never understand

2876
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
How I even got so obsessed with it in the first place

2877
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Like it just feels

2878
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So weird to think about

2879
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
How I even did that so much

2880
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I don't regret it

2881
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
But I just feel like

2882
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
The show is more than I loved MLP

2883
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
And I never got into them to such a degree

2884
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm glad I did because I never would have met any of you guys

2885
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It was the power of the zeitgeist

2886
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Man, it was the fan

2887
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
It was how active and fervent the fan base was

2888
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I got into it

2889
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Through the Newgrounds Game Story of the Blank

2890
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That was my first exposure and it really impressed me

2891
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Dude, I know

2892
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Guys, I know the exact

2893
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Date I got in MLP

2894
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
For one specific reason

2895
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
9-11, 2000

2896
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I got in MLP

2897
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I got into MLP

2898
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
On August 10th, 2011

2899
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And I know that for a fact

2900
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Because that's the date

2901
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
The Know Your Meme on My Little Pony came out

2902
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And that's how I found out about it

2903
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
And much of it was refreshing that page fervently

2904
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Waiting for new memes to drop on that page

2905
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I got into it by my friend who was trying to get me into it

2906
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Showing me Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla

2907
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Rainbow Dash presents

2908
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
With all these fucking loses

2909
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And I was like, that is my introduction to MLP

2910
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
The most confusing thing ever

2911
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
But I was literally sold on watching the show

2912
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Simply by virtue of witnessing how much effort

2913
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Would be put into a fan work

2914
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I thought, well, the show must be striking

2915
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Some sort of really deep chord

2916
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
With some pretty deep specs going on

2917
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
That's how I feel, definitely

2918
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I got into the show through TF2 analysis

2919
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Okay, since we got totally filmed again

2920
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Here's a question then

2921
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Do you think that none of us were

2922
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Do you think we were all just tangentially fans of MLP

2923
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And we're all fans of the MLP fandom

2924
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I will say this

2925
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
The fandom wasn't even there when I started watching it

2926
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
No, my enjoyment of MLP

2927
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Was sincere at many points

2928
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Yeah, no, I think there's a lot of good stuff

2929
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
About the show

2930
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And it's a matter of

2931
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I didn't get into it immediately

2932
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I watched all of Season 1

2933
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And thought it was okay

2934
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It was Season 2

2935
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And I started involving myself in the fandom

2936
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And it was more like

2937
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Finding the good

2938
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
The nuggets of gold was what was exciting

2939
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
About it

2940
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Looking deep into it

2941
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And saying, oh wow, when you really think about it

2942
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
That's an interesting idea

2943
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And so it was the analysis

2944
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
That made me love the show so much

2945
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But then when you're not trying

2946
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
To find all the great stuff

2947
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
In it and you're just looking at what it is

2948
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I realized

2949
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
That I got to a point with the show

2950
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Where I didn't start paying attention

2951
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Until three minutes into the episode

2952
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It starts

2953
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Like on my little pony episode

2954
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Opens with just characters describing

2955
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
What the plot is going to be

2956
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
For minutes on end, usually

2957
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I recently tried to go back

2958
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And watch Apple Buck Season

2959
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Because it was my favorite episode

2960
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And the whole opening segment is just

2961
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Big MacTosh going, you can't possibly

2962
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Get all these apples

2963
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And she's like, well, I can try to

2964
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And I'm like, oh okay

2965
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I don't need any of it

2966
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And I'm like, what's your favorite episode?

2967
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Huh? What are you saying?

2968
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Because you always said that's my favorite episode

2969
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
But all your videos on it were like

2970
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I like it, eh, eh

2971
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And I was like, who had the best jokes?

2972
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
That's why I liked it so much

2973
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
It has by far the funniest jokes in the show

2974
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Okay, you're a good, you're a dry humor

2975
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I felt for a long time

2976
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Like certain members of this group

2977
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Lay it down for it, Keg, lay it on

2978
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
A few members of this group

2979
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
To me really seem to be making

2980
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Just actually reflective of their

2981
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Of their heart of heart opinions

2982
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Of the show and an attempt to distance themselves

2983
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And I get that

2984
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Some people might legitimately have been caught in the zeitgeist

2985
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And really now, they don't really care as much

2986
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I was probably

2987
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
One of the most

2988
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Maybe, I was one of the most

2989
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Strident in my desire to remove myself completely

2990
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
From the pony shit

2991
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Just not talk about it all, do my own thing

2992
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And just never reverence it or whatever

2993
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And that was only because I just didn't want

2994
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
The same, like, perception of who I was

2995
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And, and, like, that fandom

2996
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Into my new shit, I just wanted to start new

2997
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And that's fine, but I am happy to admit

2998
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I go back and watch episodes of My Little Pony

2999
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
All the time

3000
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Especially the, uh, the Diamond Tera episode

3001
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Is, is one of my favorite episodes

3002
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Of anything ever

3003
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And that's up against every episode of

3004
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Gurren Lagann, every episode of Stand Alone Complex

3005
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Every fucking episode of Fooly Coolie

3006
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It is one of my favorite episodes

3007
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Of anything I've ever seen in my life

3008
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Having seen it recently

3009
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's really difficult, the thing is

3010
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
My tastes have changed considerably

3011
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Since that time, like, when I went

3012
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Into My Little Pony, I came into it from

3013
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Having been somebody who was, like,

3014
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Literally anti-plot

3015
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Like, I thought that plot

3016
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Oh, you weren't anti-plot anymore, though

3017
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You're giving me that animation, I'm so much

3018
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Ammunition right now

3019
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Everybody knows this, I've said this a million times

3020
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I was literally, I did not think

3021
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I mean, I still feel that way, but, like

3022
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I literally thought that plot does not matter

3023
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And is stupid, like, when I was

3024
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Younger, I thought plot is

3025
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
The least interesting thing about a show

3026
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And should not be paid attention to

3027
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
All I care about is the characters

3028
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And watching them interact, all I watched

3029
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Was, like, cute girl shows and, like, magical

3030
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Girl shit, you know, like, and that's what

3031
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
MLP was to me, was, like, a perfect

3032
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Representation of what I was interested in

3033
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
But after MLP, really

3034
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
At some point during the show, I got

3035
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Interested in plot-driven stuff

3036
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You know, through, like, Mass Effect

3037
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
And then

3038
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I got really into sci-fi

3039
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
And cyberpunk, and, like, if you look at what

3040
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I was watching immediately after MLP

3041
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It was all cyberpunk animation

3042
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
That's interesting that you say Mass Effect got you into

3043
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Plot-driven stuff, because I don't know

3044
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I was way more into the characters than the plot

3045
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well, yeah, that's how it got me in

3046
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
After Mass Effect won, the plot was retarded

3047
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Okay, sure, but

3048
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
What I'm saying is that it got me interested in, like,

3049
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
World-building and, like, all these high-concept

3050
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Shit, like, I hated sci-fi

3051
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And I hated politics before Mass Effect

3052
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And now those are my two favorite jobs

3053
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I still want to do a Mass Effect podcast at some point

3054
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So, like, in the wake of MLP

3055
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
The stuff I got interested in is, like

3056
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I don't know, I have, like, a much more adult

3057
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Taste, I guess, than I did even at the time

3058
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Like, MLP

3059
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
MLP was indicative of the taste

3060
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I had at the time, and it is not now

3061
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And going back to watch it, it's really

3062
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Difficult to get through all the child-proofing

3063
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
All of the, like, I, you know

3064
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
All I want to say is people seem to forget

3065
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
That there are episodes, like, putting your foot down

3066
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
In my little pony

3067
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
What the fuck is a foot?

3068
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
What the fuck is a foot?

3069
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Putting your hoof down, and how many fucking

3070
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Shows, at period, have addressed, like,

3071
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Assertiveness training seminars

3072
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Or, like, pick up culture

3073
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Or any of that kind of, like, like, nobody even

3074
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Wants to talk or think about that shit

3075
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Like, it takes weird-ass movies like Magnolia

3076
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
To even bring up the idea of that kind of shit

3077
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And yet my fucking little pony

3078
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Makes an episode about it

3079
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I will never forget, I will never

3080
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
End giving credit to that show

3081
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
For making that shit part of an episode

3082
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I totally think it deserves, it deserves the credit

3083
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You know, I really, I really like, there's

3084
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Tons of, I still like suit of recess

3085
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I still think it's fucking fantastic

3086
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I still have all my favorites

3087
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I just, what I, it's weird

3088
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Because I don't understand, really, how

3089
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I got so obsessed with it, because I'd never participated

3090
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
In a fandom at all, and never had any desire to

3091
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
But now that I'm on the outside

3092
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I just have this weird feeling of awkwardness

3093
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Because, despite the fact that

3094
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I don't regret participating as much

3095
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
As I did, like, I'm back to

3096
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Where I was before, and, like, I would never

3097
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Put that much time and effort into something

3098
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Like that

3099
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I will happily say that I was a bronie

3100
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And I will happily say

3101
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I met all of you people doing Mylepony

3102
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
It was an incredibly great thing

3103
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
That happened to me

3104
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Oh, absolutely

3105
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
We will forever

3106
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I will just say, that was all

3107
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Things about the fandom that I enjoyed

3108
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
And the sense of community that I felt when I was

3109
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
In the bronie fandom, though embarrassing to say

3110
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Was pretty great, and there are a lot of things

3111
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I like about Mylepony itself

3112
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
However, like, I don't know

3113
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Things change, bro

3114
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Things change

3115
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Things change, but sometimes we have to

3116
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Hashtag we have to go back

3117
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
That's one of those sides

3118
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
You grow up in your taste change, but also like

3119
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I mean, maybe it was always there

3120
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And I just wasn't seeing it, but, you know, at some point

3121
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
At some point the tone shifted

3122
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And it became important to me personally

3123
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
To get away from it

3124
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So as not to be lumped in with people like

3125
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
KP and Dr. Wolf

3126
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
It was important to my personal sense of identity

3127
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
That I not be one of those

3128
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I feel like this is being like a big deal

3129
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Like, for us

3130
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Because, like, the bronie thing

3131
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Was such a big thing

3132
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It's a show that, you know

3133
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
We liked it at a time, and now we don't

3134
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
As much

3135
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
There are other shows and games and things

3136
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That I have gotten into and then gone out

3137
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Of liking

3138
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And then maybe years later, I'm like

3139
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
You know what, I might go and check that out again

3140
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It's not really any different

3141
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
But the reason is like

3142
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
We're making a big deal out of it because it was a fandom

3143
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Exactly

3144
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Mylepony is like your first girlfriend

3145
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah, you'll date other girls

3146
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But you don't give a fuck about them

3147
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You only care about the original one

3148
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I always only care about her and want her forever

3149
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
For me, with MLP

3150
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
That's how it is

3151
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
The thing that makes it weird is just that

3152
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
It was the first show I ever had

3153
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Shout out to my girlfriend, by the way

3154
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Get fucked, Michelle

3155
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
At the time that Mylepony came out

3156
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I was really grappling with the fact that

3157
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I didn't have a favorite show

3158
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I loved animated death

3159
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
But I never had one thing

3160
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
That I was like, this is my favorite

3161
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And MLP became that

3162
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And I think just

3163
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
A lot of my love for the show was just

3164
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
That I loved the show

3165
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Therefore I performed that

3166
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
It's like a

3167
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Or a boros, you keep doing it

3168
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Because you say you do it

3169
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And then that keeps happening

3170
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And once you break out of that

3171
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Then it's like, okay, now that I've lost that

3172
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Now that I've lost the idea of

3173
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
DigiBronie, you know

3174
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
What is left

3175
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I just think that perhaps

3176
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I approached this whole thing

3177
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Because Ben and I never ever called ourselves

3178
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Bronies And especially I felt like that was part of

3179
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
What I did

3180
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I really enjoyed the show

3181
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
But I never really involved myself with anyone

3182
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Except people who were already cool people

3183
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Like all of the people here right now

3184
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
They only associated with those people

3185
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Ben and I never liked at all any of that rift shit

3186
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Any of those other people

3187
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
They were always trash and you could tell instantly

3188
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Except for Ben who loved it and was in TF2

3189
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And now his anarchy

3190
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
My proudest moment

3191
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
The height of my career

3192
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I figured out

3193
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Why I like my little pony

3194
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I figured it out

3195
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And you guys are gonna feel real fucking old

3196
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Because I was thinking about it

3197
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And the reason I like my little pony

3198
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I was thinking about it

3199
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It came on August 10th, 2011

3200
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I was born

3201
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I was

3202
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I got into it on August 10th, 2011

3203
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I was literally 10

3204
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I was literally 10

3205
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I was literally 10 years old

3206
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I was like what

3207
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
2022

3208
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
When I got into it

3209
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
You admit older than that Ben

3210
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
You're like 90

3211
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I've aged like 70 years

3212
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I was 22

3213
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Leaving the

3214
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Leaving the brony fan and really takes a toll

3215
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
On your soul

3216
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
That's probably why I liked it

3217
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Because I was a baby

3218
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
The rest of us have no excuse

3219
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
No excuse basically

3220
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I see

3221
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
You get involved

3222
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Heavily enough and something like that

3223
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And it becomes a part of who you are

3224
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I know exactly why I liked it

3225
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It's the art style

3226
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's very simple and cute and pastel colored

3227
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
It's all the things I like

3228
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
You're a girl so you're allowed to feel that way

3229
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I fell in love with it

3230
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I really fell in love with the show

3231
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
When the winter wrap-up song played

3232
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Because I fucking love musicals

3233
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And I will watch any show that has music in it

3234
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
God I just want to be a musical man forever

3235
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It's a great song

3236
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
The thing that makes it unique is that

3237
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It is the cheap, chintzy, 5 year old girl's show

3238
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
But done competently

3239
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Sometimes it's great

3240
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
So you kind of sign waves right around

3241
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
In the pretty good zone

3242
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And I believe I'm looking around

3243
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
When it comes to western shows

3244
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
With some poppy animation for girls

3245
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
It's still probably the best one

3246
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And that has a unique position

3247
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
And if you're going through a certain dark part of your life

3248
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Having something like that could be just the right thing

3249
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
To pick you up and make you happy

3250
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
And it's more of a time in place thing

3251
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And slap you down

3252
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
For me it was definitely a

3253
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
New thing and seeing all the world building

3254
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And just experiencing it for the first time

3255
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It's a great experience

3256
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
And it was a great way to inspire lots of people

3257
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
To make the fandom

3258
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
People say, oh people just stuck it into the fandom

3259
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Well, the fandom became the kind of fandom that it was

3260
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Because of what the show inspired in them

3261
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And that just dragged it out

3262
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I feel like...

3263
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Everyone of us here who was inspired to create art

3264
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Through the My Little Pony

3265
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Analysis community or whatever it was

3266
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I feel like we all had that within us

3267
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Of course, that

3268
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Ability was inside all of us to go do the kind of thing

3269
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
But I am just so grateful for the show

3270
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
To being the vehicle that helped me develop it

3271
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I am such

3272
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Gratitude for it

3273
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I have nothing but respect for the show

3274
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And I will defend it

3275
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Because I don't want to look like

3276
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
A fucking idiot for having like that

3277
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I really thought you were going somewhere else with that

3278
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Yeah, me too

3279
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yeah, no

3280
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
By the way, how long is this going to go?

3281
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I think we'll book this with a podcast with that anime snob

3282
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Whoa!

3283
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
We're going to do just for that anime snob

3284
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
This is

3285
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Jesus fucking crazy

3286
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
How fucking telling is that?

3287
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The Digi Brony is betraying us

3288
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
You're fucking anime snob

3289
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
At least just bring him in

3290
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Bring him in

3291
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
It's with the

3292
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Pause and select and all that

3293
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I'll make them wait

3294
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
We're going a while longer

3295
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I feel similarly about like

3296
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
The show giving me the confidence

3297
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
To make stuff

3298
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Because I always wanted to make gaming videos

3299
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But I feel like if I had just

3300
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Like if I hadn't been

3301
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Part of the pony community and met anybody

3302
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Doing reviews and

3303
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Had a chance to test

3304
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
You know my abilities

3305
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I probably would have ended up as like

3306
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I don't know, a cadichorus or someone worse than me

3307
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Like someone just okay

3308
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Not hundreds of thousands of subscribers

3309
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I honestly think

3310
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I'm not a subscriber cad

3311
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I think I would just not be as where I am

3312
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
If I didn't have the community

3313
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
He happened in the fires of the

3314
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Brony fanaticism

3315
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
In the Brony sphere, think of it like a fucking tea tree

3316
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And there was one specific chemical

3317
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
That all of us had that attracted us together

3318
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
And then we forged our bond

3319
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
In that realm and we had this

3320
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Ideological synchronization

3321
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
That we're still riding on this time

3322
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I wasn't doing analysis videos at the time

3323
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I was following all of you pretty closely

3324
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Or at least some of you pretty closely

3325
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I never would have done anything youtube related

3326
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
If I hadn't gotten dragged into this shit storm

3327
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
So I'm grateful that

3328
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I was able to expand as a creator

3329
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Do more things and I definitely

3330
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Gained more confidence, more skills

3331
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
And I have a ton of things that I've done

3332
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
And can do now that I never would have been able to otherwise

3333
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So that was all pretty fun

3334
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'm extremely grateful to the

3335
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Brony community for

3336
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Allowing me to take advantage of them

3337
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And launch my career

3338
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I would not, it was a very small pond

3339
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
That I was able to be a big fish in

3340
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
By being smarter than everybody else

3341
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Involved with it

3342
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You know

3343
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
That's the Brony way

3344
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
When I made my first Brony video

3345
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I told my friend Ghost Lightning

3346
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I can probably gain

3347
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Enough subscribers from this

3348
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
That once I switch to doing games analysis

3349
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I'll have an audience

3350
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And that worked

3351
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And it was great because imagine if that hadn't happened

3352
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
That would mean that now sitting

3353
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Pretty today in 2017 you'd have to look at the first year

3354
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And a half of your career making like

3355
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Video game and anime videos

3356
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And it's like you know that a lot of people would

3357
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Get curious and watch them and you'd be like

3358
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Don't but thankfully since they're all pony

3359
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
No one's gonna go see them so you don't have to deal

3360
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
With people seeing them

3361
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
No one ever goes back to my like

3362
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
The earliest videos that anybody will watch from me

3363
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Are already pretty good because I cut my teeth

3364
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
On this other bullshit that nobody wants

3365
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
To be involved with unless they already were

3366
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
You can downplay your personal

3367
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Investment in this all you want did you

3368
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
No no no I'm not downplaying anything

3369
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I'm just saying that my fans will

3370
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Not go watch those videos

3371
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And those videos are much worse than what I do

3372
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Now because I cut my teeth on them

3373
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Like I learned how to make videos

3374
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
By doing pony analysis

3375
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
When I watch sometimes I go back and watch those

3376
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
It's really fucking hard to watch them

3377
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I think it's funny that

3378
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Digi Brony is using a teeth

3379
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I know I was thinking about that

3380
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I'm thankful

3381
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
For the Brony community because BronyCon

3382
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
What was it 2015 I think

3383
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Yeah I think so

3384
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
The second year we were all there together

3385
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
It was probably the best convention of my entire life

3386
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
And I'm so glad I'm in all of you

3387
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And I'm really happy

3388
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
That was really great

3389
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
My favorite moment

3390
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
In this movie is the first time

3391
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Celestia was on screen and I was said to my girlfriend

3392
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
That's the voice actress I almost punched

3393
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
In the face

3394
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Bitch

3395
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
By the way hippo

3396
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I just want to say

3397
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I need you to apologize for my little pony

3398
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Right now you're a brick and I don't want to have to place you down

3399
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I don't want to have to place you down hippo

3400
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Please apologize for my little pony

3401
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I will never ever apologize

3402
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'll leave you alone

3403
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I'm gonna have to push you down

3404
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I'm gonna have to push you down

3405
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's just how it's gonna be

3406
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
On record right now

3407
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I'm 10 to 15 minutes

3408
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm gonna push you down

3409
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
She should have been the main character in this movie

3410
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
If she was the main character then I would be screaming

3411
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I just want to say that we've had

3412
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
We've had a real helpful discussion

3413
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
A real nuanced discussion

3414
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
About the pros and cons and the thing we like and dislike

3415
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
And what it all meant to us

3416
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But I would like to just throw all that right out the window

3417
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Because I don't know about you guys

3418
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
But I've had a couple too many diet code red

3419
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Mountain Dews and I gotta take a piss

3420
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And I'm gonna fucking do it

3421
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I'm gonna fucking take a piss on the movie

3422
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm gonna take a piss on the bronies

3423
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And I'm gonna take a piss

3424
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
On everyone in the world

3425
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Can I personally say what

3426
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I'm literally sorry

3427
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I have to leave right now

3428
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Because that's why we scheduled this earlier

3429
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
So that he could leave

3430
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Also I have double booked a podcast

3431
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I guess that's the way the wind is blowing

3432
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
No, you don't understand

3433
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I'm peeing right now

3434
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Ben you wanna pee with me

3435
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
You're my best friend

3436
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Strawberry milk and phantom horn

3437
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Strawberry milk and phantom horn

3438
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
We're hitting on the MLP movie

3439
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Bloody fuckers, calculers, we're paying for a thousand years

3440
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I hear it

3441
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
This is the best ASMR

3442
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Yeah, this should have been the ASMR cast

3443
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Oh wow, here we go

3444
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Do you wanna make your point?

3445
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I wanna say what I'm power

3446
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I love power

3447
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It's too much, it's overflowing

3448
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Get a new bottle, get a new bottle

3449
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I'm holding it in

3450
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Please at least stop talking

3451
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Fuck me, fuck unicorn

3452
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Fuck alicorn

3453
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Everything that ever was or ever will be

3454
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
In the holy land of equestria

3455
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
You're all pee

3456
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
You're all pee now

3457
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Go ahead

3458
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
You're so gross

3459
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I know

3460
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Well, now I can

3461
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I don't wanna be honest and stuff like that

3462
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Now that they're peeing

3463
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
So liberating

3464
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I feel like we don't need to do questions

3465
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Jesus Christ

3466
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
You guys can do questions after me and once you leave

3467
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Oh yeah, okay, bye

3468
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Bye, bye

3469
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
You're leaving

3470
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Alright, we'll just say

3471
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Let's do a handful

3472
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I don't fucking know

3473
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Yep

3474
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I was just wondering who's leaving and why

3475
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Munchie's leaving because he has to go on a trip immediately

3476
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Like that's why we had to do this at two

3477
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Okay, understood

3478
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Go to it, people have to leave

3479
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Goodbye

3480
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Munchie get the fuck out of the car

3481
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I'm sorry

3482
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
He was peed after he left

3483
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Yeah

3484
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I wanted him here

3485
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
You want to make your point

3486
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
The mood is run though

3487
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Okay, tell you what

3488
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
We'll come back to that after some questions

3489
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Yeah, I want to answer at least one question

3490
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Before we all fucking

3491
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Before I take off to go talk to

3492
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Snob or whatever

3493
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Munchie was actually the one looking at the discord

3494
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
If somebody else wants to pull that up

3495
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I'll take a look at it

3496
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Okay, cool

3497
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
What do we got here?

3498
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
No, that's shit, that's terrible

3499
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I don't know

3500
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
At draw fill draw asks

3501
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Will there ever be a hashtag dad con

3502
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I guess where our dads go to a convention

3503
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I would assume

3504
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
We'll have that con once Munchie steals all the dads

3505
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yeah

3506
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
We'll put them all in a bunker together

3507
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I'll send my dad along

3508
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
In a package

3509
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Have we ever answered

3510
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Do you plan on having children?

3511
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I don't know

3512
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I think we might have on some sort of a podcast

3513
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I think on like a really earlier podcast

3514
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I definitely intend on having children

3515
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
No, we have answered this

3516
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Because Nate gave us this whole rundown

3517
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Of what his kids are going to be

3518
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
That's right, I did

3519
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Vincent and Charlotte, yep, that's right

3520
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I will never have children

3521
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I think it's retarded

3522
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I'm way too selfish

3523
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I would sacrifice my children

3524
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
At the first possible opportunity

3525
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
To advance myself

3526
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I've heard you talk about that too

3527
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I don't know what a child is

3528
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
But I plan to have fillies

3529
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That's good

3530
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Because I'm still

3531
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Give us another question

3532
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm not finding any I want to read out

3533
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I'll just quickly answer the question while you're finding the thing

3534
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Sure, go for it

3535
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't particularly want any at this current time

3536
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Maybe in the future

3537
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
But highly, I doubt it very highly

3538
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Don't like children

3539
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I agree, Paige

3540
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Well

3541
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
In the Patreon chat

3542
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Crafty asks how long do you take to pee

3543
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And we just answered that live

3544
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
You've got that on right here

3545
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Ascan asks

3546
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
The biggest let down you've ever experienced

3547
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
The My Little Pony movie

3548
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah

3549
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Oh guys, guys, guys

3550
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
When I said I don't like children

3551
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
My cat mealed and came up to me and I was snuggling me

3552
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Yes, he is my child, I like you

3553
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Yes, they're good

3554
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
We can control them and bend them to our will

3555
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Here's an actually great question

3556
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
El Gringo Bandito

3557
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
asks what's your favorite sword

3558
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
That's a good question

3559
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I like a good bastard sword

3560
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
A big

3561
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Hilt bastard sword

3562
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I just like bastard because then I could say it in class

3563
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
And the teacher would be like I could say bastard

3564
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
A pokey sword

3565
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I really don't know anything about swords

3566
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
The one that does its job

3567
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
No

3568
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
That's like the weakest one

3569
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Folded a thousand times

3570
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Catanas are

3571
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Pretty cool though

3572
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Eek

3573
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Real

3574
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
They cut the weak western steel

3575
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Are you kidding me?

3576
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
My favorite sword is a specific answer

3577
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I like Stormbringer

3578
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It's a sword from the Eternal Champion Saga

3579
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
The Elric Saga, it's pretty cool

3580
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
It's a sword all made of black

3581
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Red runes etched into it

3582
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
And with the sword it works

3583
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
If you get cut by it, it steals your soul

3584
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And it's fucking awesome

3585
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
The Storm King could have used that

3586
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
It was funny

3587
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I was trying to remember the Storm King's name

3588
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
And all I could think of was Stormbringer

3589
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I'm like it's not Stormbringer, he's not that cool

3590
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Fuck that shit

3591
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
It's simple, but I've always really loved the Buster Sword

3592
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
What can I say, the Buster Sword is dope

3593
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
When I was younger I liked

3594
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
The more ornately designed swords

3595
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
But now I like big, simple

3596
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I really like a Sonosuke

3597
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Sagaura sword from Ruroni Kenshin

3598
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
That he uses one time

3599
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Before he does

3600
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Fist of Cuffs

3601
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
And also this

3602
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Zvihander from Dark Souls

3603
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
It's kind of like a bastard sword

3604
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's not from Dark Souls, it's from real life

3605
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
That's a real sword

3606
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I like it because of Dark Souls

3607
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I think maybe my favorite sword is one of Zolo's

3608
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
swords

3609
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
You call them Zolo

3610
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I grew up calling him Zolo

3611
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
One of Zoro's sword

3612
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Which one?

3613
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I really like the blue one

3614
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It's not even his best one

3615
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
That's the cursed one, right?

3616
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
No, no, it's one he gets later

3617
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
As a replacement for one that breaks

3618
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Someone gives it to him

3619
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Because it's the best one they got lying around

3620
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Oh, that's really early

3621
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
With the black sheath

3622
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
The cursed one with the weird

3623
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Wavy pattern

3624
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
In the cut of it

3625
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I really fucking love

3626
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Zoro's sword

3627
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
And tragically, that one you're talking about right now

3628
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Is destroyed by a man with rust powers

3629
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
And gets replaced later on

3630
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
The blue one does?

3631
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
That's right

3632
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
But I liked it because

3633
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
It wasn't like some Mary Sue sword

3634
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
It wasn't like the best sword ever

3635
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
It was an excellent sword

3636
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
That someone gave to him because they felt he deserved it

3637
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And it fucking died

3638
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
It suffered a tragic end

3639
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
But it looked really cool

3640
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Zoro's swords have great backstories

3641
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Especially because the one he gets later to replace it

3642
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Is actually a sword used by this guy

3643
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Who was in one of Oda's previous works

3644
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
About a fucking dragon slaying samurai guy

3645
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
That's the dopest thing ever

3646
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
None of the other questions are interesting to me

3647
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
So I'm going to take off

3648
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
You guys can keep answering it

3649
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Okay, peace dog

3650
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Bye, didgybrony

3651
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Get out, didgybrony

3652
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Tell us a tall tale, why don't you

3653
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I got a question from the PCP chat

3654
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
It could be interesting

3655
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
If the PCP were to form a band of any genre

3656
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
What would the roles for each member be

3657
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
And what would the first album be called

3658
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
The album would definitely be gay and dead

3659
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Absolutely

3660
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Gay and dead too

3661
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
I would be guitar boy

3662
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I want to be the designated band

3663
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Scatman

3664
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
That would be what I would do

3665
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
That would be what I would do

3666
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I don't know

3667
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Bye

3668
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Okay, I'm not down for this trickling away

3669
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
We would instantly kick Davoo out of the band

3670
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Okay, let's

3671
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
It's a musical difference

3672
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Alright, we're done everybody

3673
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Thanks for listening, this has been kegstandard

3674
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And this has been two best brothers bitch about ponies

3675
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Subscribe to our channel

3676

3677
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000

And make sure you send us more questions

3679
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Ask hashtag

3680
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Ask PCP on Twitter

3681
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Or join our god damn patreon

3682
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Because we got bonus episodes

3683
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And with one dollar you get access to the discord

3684
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Where we just read a bunch of questions

3685
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
That are frankly more likely to be read

3686
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And there's a great community there

3687
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Those people are dope, they're the best fans of the PCP

3688
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
They're all fantastic

3689
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
And I got a thing to plug

3690
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
If you want to see

3691
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Really awkward first interaction conversations

3692
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
With all of us

3693
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
For the horse cast

3694
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Because that's what this PCP was before

3695
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I was never on the horse cast though

3696
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
You fuckers

3697
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
That's true

3698
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
So fuck all of these guys, they're gay

3699
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I thought by that time we had made the PCP chat

3700
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Or something, I don't know

3701
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
It was a long time ago

3702
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Also, the Procrastiners podcast

3703
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Is on iTunes and on Google Play

3704
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Just to alleviate some confusion

3705
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Because I've gotten some questions about this

3706
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Even though it's technically on Google Play

3707
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
You have to go to the Google Play Music app

3708
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
On your phone, not the Google Play store

3709
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
It's really retarded, I don't know why it's that way

3710
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
But you go to the Google Play Music app

3711
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
And then you go to the podcast section

3712
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
If you want to listen to it on your Android phone

3713
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Fantastic

3714
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Or you just go to the podcast app on your iPhone

3715
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Thanks, thanks Steve Jobs

3716
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
What a great guy

3717
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
You really dicked us on this one

3718
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Well, he's dead now, so we got to the last one

3719
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
We've got some merch as well

3720
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
There's some links below, yeah buy that shit

3721
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I don't know, whatever the fuck you want to do fam

3722
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I guess that's it

3723
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Thanks for listening everybody

3724
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Let's put your hooves together

3725
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And say goodbye

3726
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Bye

3727
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
My little pony

3728
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
My little pony

3729
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
My little pony

3730
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I used to wonder what friendship could

3731
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Okay, I'm done

3732
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
My little pony, I used to watch the show

3733
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
But now I don't

3734
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Yeah

3735
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Yeah, uh

3736
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I'm supposed to

3737
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Be working

3738
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Right now

3739
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I'm supposed to

3740
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Be working right now

3741
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
But I'm not

3742
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Working

3743
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I'm doing nothing

3744
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Why dick I'm

3745
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Drinking

3746
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Myself I'm sucking

3747
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I am an asshole

3748
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I am a stupid

3749
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I got a

3750
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Deadline

3751
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Don't want to do it
