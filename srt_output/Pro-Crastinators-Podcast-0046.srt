1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,720
It's the same every day. Scrolling, always scrolling, looking for answers. But none ever

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:28,720
come. Who are you? It's been over a year since this search began and we're no closer

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,200
to finding out than when we started. I'm starting to think maybe he doesn't want to be found.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,880
Well, we've done our best. I guess there are some things you just have to learn to let go.

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,880
After all, we're only human.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Sir, our calculation show at 99% matched.

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,720
Do them again, damn you. We have to be sure.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
It's me, Austin. Oh, son of a bitch.

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:02:06,080
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Procrastinator's Podcast.

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,680
I am the best guy ever, your host, The Best Man. Dude, did you just see the guy there

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
saying we know who he is? Okay, yes, we've got a huge announcement, people, a huge announcement.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,400
But before we get to that, we have Hippocrates here. He's a guy that isn't real. We've got Munchy.

13
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,960
Oh, fucking press, wait, it's the fucking it's him. We've got Monkey Jones. I wish I was dead.

14
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Big Manga anime fan here, and we've got Endless Jess.

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,720
Hi. Endless Jess. Hi, everybody. I'm in the game.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,040
Is that Homestar Runner? Is that Homestuck, my favorite character? Is that Homo Jess?

17
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
Is that Skip and Take? It's me. It's me, Hobo Jess.

18
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,240
It's me, Homo Jess.

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,240
Everyone's favorite character from the Endless Jessiverse.

20
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Okay, guys, we have a huge announcement today, and we've got a bombshell announcement,

21
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
not maybe like two hours ago. We finally had an answer to the question that's been

22
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,200
plaguing scientists for generations. All right, we have Virgin. The answer is yes.

23
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
The answer is yes. But unrelated, but similarly as important.

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,160
We have cracked the code. We have discovered the identity of the PCP guy, our mascot guy.

25
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,880
We have found out who the fuck he is. Okay, so let's just set this so if anyone doesn't know,

26
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,840
we've been asking people on Twitter and everywhere that this is not a joke. We really had no idea

27
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,000
who this mascot guy was. He was someone that I found one day when I was just on A, and you

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
know how I like to use a lot of fucking mango reaction faces and shit. I just used him because

29
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,720
he looked like a real procrastinator to me with that expression. So he became the mascot.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
And we'd been, I had no idea what the fuck he was. I'd been trying to fight out for,

31
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,880
the show's been going for over a year, and I have been actively looking for that entire time

32
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,920
and as of people. And today is the day where we finally got our answer. So, okay, our buddy over

33
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,040
on Twitter at Stumble Reel, Akane 3, I don't know, at Stumble Reel. Apparently, actually,

34
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:22,320
it's months ago, actually, he had tweeted at Ben Saints. So, Stumble Reel here had tweeted at Ben

35
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,200
Saints like months ago. The act like the information about the guy, but Ben didn't get it because

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,520
he's an idiot. He doesn't, can't do anything right. But yeah, he's gone. He's dead. But today,

37
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,200
he linked in response to the recent conversation we've been having about who the fuck this guy is,

38
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,400
he provided a screenshot of the actual page. So we're talking about page 14, page 13 of

39
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,160
chapter five of the manga, Inari Konkon Koi Iroha. If you go to that fucking page,

40
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
there'll be a link in the description so you can see for yourself. They, he is the boy himself

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,560
by the name of Toka Fushimi, character from this manga. So we're talking about Toka.

42
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
Hiroshima.

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
What's even more disappointing is that this was one of Digi's top 10

44
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,760
animes of 2014 and he didn't even recognize the character.

45
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Isn't that fascinating? And we, you should be able to see on the screen.

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes, that's right.

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
That's how we found out.

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
Her though, he's gay.

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,800
And we look on this, on the screen, you'll see that what we have there is the anime version

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
of this exact pose from like chapter, chapter five of the manga.

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
He's a real anime.

52
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,560
He did it.

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,280
He's a real anime.

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,160
He really did it.

55
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
He did it.

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,520
You know, I, I, I, it's, it's amazing.

57
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
We're so proud of him.

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,920
He's come so far.

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,960
I, I am immediately, I'm immediately fascinated by this character. And by the way guys, I looked

60
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,800
up his Wikipedia entry. I thought I'd read you a little snippet so you could know that what

61
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,680
we're dealing with here is the most red-pilled hardcore motherfucker who's ever existed. All right.

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Okay. So here we go. Here we go. So here's Toka Fushimi's little bio from the Wikipedia page.

63
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,080
Toka, he is handsome, but a recluse who spends his time away from others and keeps to himself,

64
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,920
frequently studying to get into a good university and also has a strange poem blog post.

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,040
So we're talking about an internet creator here, a kindred spirit to us.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
He is also short-tempered and childish, relatable, relatable.

67
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Especially the childish part.

68
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
Yeah.

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Frequently being referred to as having eighth grade syndrome or, you know, G-B-O.

70
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
He's an eighth grade syndrome.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
Oh my God. I finally know what I am.

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,920
I don't know. Okay. I don't know if you guys are joking, but that's Chunebio. It's like a specific

73
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,360
thing in Japan where like kids think they have superpowers and like pretend that their evil

74
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,240
organizations are like following them. It's, it's a big, Google Chune's and you'll see like,

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
it's a real thing.

76
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,200
That's literally returning from NAROTO?

77
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes.

78
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Sounds like it's on NHK.

79
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
It's, it's some gay Japanimation shit.

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,080
So yeah, he's a Chune despite being in his last year of high school.

81
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
He also tends to get lost easily.

82
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,880
He's, so he's a millennial who doesn't understand directions.

83
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah.

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
He is protective of Inari and initially apprehensive of Uka, who's like the ghost

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,520
magic spirit from the series, believes that she has malicious intents,

86
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
but realizes she is a good person and befriends her.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, befriending a woman, very blue pill, very blue pill.

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,560
Even letting her come over to play games.

89
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,320
Playing games with a woman there for procreation and nothing else, you fucking cock.

90
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
What else we got here?

91
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay, that's it.

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,520
The rest is boring.

93
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
And he hates sex.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,320
I forgot to read the last sentence there.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Oh yeah.

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
The last sentence.

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Big, big hater of sex.

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
Big, big fan of the Listen Buddy podcast, funnily enough.

99
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Can I, can I spoil you on the ending of this series guys?

100
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120
All right, this is a spoiler for the end of this podcast.

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
No, no, no, no, I wanted to watch it.

102
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm going to cover my ears.

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Go ahead.

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,800
Okay, here we go.

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
So, okay, at the end, he confesses to like the ghost, the series is over.

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,080
In chapter 40 of 43, he confesses his love to Uka, the like spirit ghost lady.

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,000
And by the end of the series, he has literally become a god.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,600
So, he could be with her and she has his child.

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Oh my god.

110
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,640
So, our boy has started a family.

111
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
He's become, he's, he's gone full red pill.

112
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,200
Do you think his child is the PCP?

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Oh my god!

114
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,680
Are the spoilers over yet?

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm still covering my ears.

116
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Does that make us old?

117
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
No, they're not done yet.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,400
They're not, I was going to say, we, we, he became a god.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
We are gods.

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
He has given birth to this organization.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Oh my god.

122
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
This very important organization.

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
This very us here.

124
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Our mascot could have turned out to be any old buddy, but I'm not disappointed at all

125
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,240
in this revelation of who he turned out to be.

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
This is the best possible outcome.

127
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
Really, that ending.

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
We've all got the blood of the Messiah within us.

129
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,520
That's right.

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,360
I did not expect for us to be this gold-pilled, but here we are.

131
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,840
Here we are.

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
Man, this is, this is great.

133
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
No, we're fucking like black, we're like, we're like black-pilled or green-pilled.

134
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,440
We're black-pilled.

135
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
Yeah, guts is the black pill, right?

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,440
We're black.

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
Dude, we're pro-pilled.

138
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,920
We are pro-pilled.

139
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
We're mics or videos.

Look at those.

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Well, so that's it, folks.

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
Tokafushimi from Inari Kon Kon Koi Iroha.

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
There you go, that's our guy.

153
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
That's a podcast over.

154
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, guys.

155
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Man, I've got Afterglow.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I've got the Afterglow going.

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
All right, so let's move on to our actual topic for the day.

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
Wait, I want to point out one thing real quick if I can, Nate.

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
Yeah, sure.

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
Today, this podcast right here is the first time that Munchie and I

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
have been seen together in public.

162
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah.

163
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,320
That's right.

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
It's a big deal for me.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
It's a big deal for me.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
I said all of our secret sescapades.

167
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Right.

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
You know, you know.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Sescapades.

170
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, we've had lots of, we've had lots of sescapades

171
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
when nobody was looking, but now we're together in a podcast

172
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,240
on the internet.

173
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,880
It's a big deal.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,520
You're really coming out.

175
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,360
It's our first time, yeah, talking.

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,400
Now when people fuck up our names.

177
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,960
Now when people fuck up our names.

178
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,120
That's so bad, Nate, you fucking sewer rat.

179
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
You guys, if you guys didn't have literally the same name,

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
it wouldn't be a problem.

181
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
But, Nate, I'm going to fucking kill you.

182
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,560
You're dead.

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,080
So monumental occasion, and by that, I mean, doesn't,

184
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,640
doesn't matter.

185
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,360
Don't worry about it.

186
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,600
All right.

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
So let's move on to our fucking topic and let's see how

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,280
this Munchie-Mum-Key who has same guy dynamic plays out.

189
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,360
Even I'm going to fuck up the names and I don't even talk

190
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
about myself in the third person.

191
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,320
Okay.

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,880
So our topic today is irony and sincerity.

193
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, that's that's what it's going to be.

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
So let me read the actual question that our buddy

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
over on the fucking thing asked.

196
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,520
So our question was from atmanslayer0, and he asks,

197
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,200
at TP Crastinators, you could talk about the ubiquity of

198
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,480
self-deprecating humor on the internet and the rise of

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,200
wholesome memes.

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
So, okay, so he's not actually asking a question,

201
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
he's just giving us a topic suggestion.

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
So he's talking about wholesome memes and self-depreciating

203
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
humor, but I think the broader scope of what he's asking

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
is about irony, sincerity, you know, that whole, that whole

205
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
whole gang, that whole gang.

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
It's Seinfeld and how it's the best show ever.

207
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,600
Yep, yep.

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
And the, when I saw this, my first thought was that video

209
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,280
that some, some fuckboy on YouTube had made recently

210
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,360
about David Foster Wallace and, you know, irony and shit.

211
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Yeah, who searched the problem with irony?

212
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
Yeah, it'll tell.

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,360
The problem with irony, that's right.

214
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
Then I'll have that motherfucker smug face with like the

215
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
stupid, like, towel.

216
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,760
The bandam.

217
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,160
You know, I watched that, I watched that video because

218
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
you pointed it out right before this podcast, and I was,

219
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
I was none too pleased with it.

220
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,320
I have a, I have a, I have a point of contention

221
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
with that video.

222
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, let's hear it.

223
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,640
Well, like the whole, or we could do it later.

224
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
Ah, the fuck it, who cares?

225
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
I think the problem with David Foster Wallace is that

226
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
infinite jest is way too fucking long.

227
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,640
I think the problem with David Foster Wallace is that

228
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,960
well, it is supposed to be infinite, so isn't it really

229
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,520
too short?

230
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,120
That's, that's true.

231
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,960
Never ending story was too short.

232
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
Yeah, that was, they both lies.

233
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah.

234
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
Never ending story is neither late nor early.

235
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,280
It arrives precisely what it needs to.

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,960
It's also not a story, it's a movie.

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,320
They really shit the bed on that one.

238
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
Let me, let me, all right, so let me break down what

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,040
this is about.

240
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,280
So in the, in that video, because that's really what

241
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,760
interests me to talk about, it talks about David Foster

242
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Wallace was talking about how the rise of, of post

243
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
modernism is sort of, they're, they're within that,

244
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
or they're components of it that celebrate the

245
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,760
destruction of like the cultural norms of the day.

246
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,080
So, you know, things like irony are celebrated in the

247
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,720
post modernist, you know, kind of art style that we see

248
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,120
today.

249
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,320
So things like Seinfeld that are sitcoms that make fun

250
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,360
of the wholesomeness and the, the sugary way that

251
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,400
problems get resolved on older classical sitcoms.

252
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
It's taking that and making fun of the whole thing.

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
And so in that way it's being ironic and that's, that's

254
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
what post modernism is.

255
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
Whereas recently we're seeing things like, like the

256
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
show community, even Rick and Morty.

257
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
And I, Rick and Morty I think is a really interesting

258
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,800
example because Rick and Morty is a very irreverent

259
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
show with a lot of irony laced throughout it.

260
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
But there was, and I think Jesse and me especially

261
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
do this a lot, we, we relate to the way that it, it is

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,640
fully cloaked in irony, but then when you dig down

263
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
into it and you just give it time, there's always a

264
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,280
core of emotion and like good vibes that you just

265
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,680
need to crack that nut and the, the, the nut is

266
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
flaky and delicious when you get to the core.

267
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
That was my, that was my contention with the video.

268
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
It seemed to be using Rick and Morty as an example

269
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
of the opposite, like a cynical show.

270
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
And I don't think so.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,760
And it, it seemed like the whole video was sort of

272
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
giving off this false narrative of like there were

273
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
wholesome shows and then there was an era of cynical

274
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,440
shows and now we're getting back to wholesome again

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
when the fact is like we've always had both at the

276
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,400
same time and both have always been great in their own

277
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
ways.

278
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,440
Yeah, I think he definitely oversimplified, but we

279
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,680
can talk about the topics, you know, like the two

280
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
irony and sincerity outside of like the temporal

281
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
frame, you know, we can just talk about them in

282
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,960
general because I think, um, they're, they're

283
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,760
always going to be applicable like, uh, you know,

284
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
South Park, very, and it could, okay, because that's

285
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
the thing that, and this is what really is

286
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,240
interesting to me.

287
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,160
David Wallace was talking about how like irony is a

288
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,960
purely destructive force and that's what it is.

289
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
It takes things and it makes fun of them.

290
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
It shows how they're not important.

291
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,160
It points out how silly and ridiculous they can

292
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,120
be, uh, like, like Seinfeld does with like everyday

293
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,200
life in, you know, New York City or whatever.

294
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,160
Average like, uh, uh, getting to be middle-aged

295
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,400
man, living in a city, not so charmed as we

296
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
thought from all those fucking sitcoms of the

297
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
nineties and eighties and shit.

298
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,680
Uh, but, and I think that is a valuable tool, but

299
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
I personally am a big advocate for their being,

300
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,480
or at least I really enjoy when a story has,

301
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
like, it doesn't just break things down, but it

302
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,400
also builds something up.

303
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,120
Like, it does talk about how, okay, like, yeah,

304
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
living in New York City or whatever, like being a

305
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Jew, not all it's cracked up to me, but, uh, but,

306
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
you know, like, like what Rick and Morty does,

307
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,040
like Rick and Morty is really the great thing,

308
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,400
because like, uh, the way that, uh, Rick, like in

309
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
one of the best episodes where he has that

310
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,400
relationship with a hive mind lady, what's her name,

311
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
uh, Felicity, Clarissa explains it all.

312
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
Yeah, I believe that was her name.

313
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
Uh, she, he has this like romantic involvement

314
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,080
with this, with this person and in, in contrast

315
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
to his normal devil may care attitude,

316
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
that episode is a really good job of showing

317
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
at the end how he like, even though he looks

318
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
like he's just like this fun loving guy who

319
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
doesn't give a fuck about anything, he actually

320
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
does like have some dependency on the

321
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,600
relationships he has and he feels a sincere

322
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,560
deep pain when like, she finally realizes that

323
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
like, you know, this guy is a destructive

324
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
force in my life, I need to be elsewhere.

325
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
And so, and then he tries to fucking kill himself

326
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
and it's, it's an incredibly emotional scene

327
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
that everybody loves and is, you know, one of

328
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
the famous ones from the show.

329
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
But the way that he's, he's like, that's not a

330
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
joke, like it's not a joke that, that Rick

331
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,600
tried to kill himself.

332
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,880
That is like a holy shit, like it is horrible

333
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,960
to be a human being who has these things

334
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
happen to him and we all experience it.

335
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
And so it's just like the super relatable

336
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,520
scene that I think is, is kind of, is one of

337
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,560
those teachable human experience moments,

338
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
you know, and uh, and that, that's the kind

339
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
of thing that I like to have at the, at

340
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
sort of the end of my arc of like comedy,

341
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
comedy, irreverence, and then at the end

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
it's like, oh yeah, you know, we're all,

343
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,520
we had a bunch of laughs, but there's,

344
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
there's some things that we need to think

345
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,120
about and seriously at the end of the day.

346
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm sorry the mysterious winner entered,

347
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
but not every cartoon needs to have a moral.

348
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm not saying they all need to, I'm just

349
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,640
saying that I really like what it does.

350
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,440
It's something that I like.

351
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
It's like a trope I like, but I think

352
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,560
that it's a tool.

353
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't, uh, I don't agree that irony is

354
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,680
like inherently cynical or inherently like

355
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,280
not sincere.

356
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
I think that irony can be sincere.

357
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
I don't think they're opposites, because

358
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
like, have an example.

359
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
Yeah, like, um, like, uh, the room,

360
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,760
by the Tommy Wiseau movie.

361
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
Everybody sees it the first time,

362
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,680
and they, they want to like it ironically,

363
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
because it's so bad or whatever,

364
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
and so they're ironically enjoying it at first,

365
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
but then they're showing it to their friends,

366
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
and every time they show it to their friends,

367
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,360
they get that sincere enjoyment of like

368
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,200
showing this funny thing to everybody,

369
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,320
and they start to like it more.

370
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,600
And the next thing you know, you're having

371
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,640
parties, and you're all watching their

372
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,120
room together.

373
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,240
And the next thing you know, you're going

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
to a movie theater, and you're watching

375
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
the room in a movie theater, and it's like

376
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
an event with your friends, and it's no

377
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,680
longer like an ironic thing.

378
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
You're sincerely a fan of this terrible,

379
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,080
goofy, amazing film, The Room.

380
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,840
You know, I'm with you, dude, and I am

381
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,280
a huge Room fan.

382
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,480
Absolutely love the film.

383
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
Possibly my favorite movie of all time.

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah.

385
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,520
Um, but the thing is, and uh, oh boy,

386
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
this is going down a dark path.

387
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Uh, I have to bring up, uh,

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
authorial intent.

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
A little bit, a little bit into this, uh...

390
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Done, done, done!

391
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
It's just that, it's just that,

392
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,240
I wonder how important we should consider

393
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,280
when we're talking about like, okay,

394
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
like the message of a show or whatever.

395
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,160
Tommy Wiseau did not intend for people

396
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
to have that experience.

397
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
That is something that came from like the,

398
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,040
you know, the community that formed

399
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,960
around this like new understanding

400
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,600
of the work.

401
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,920
And Tommy Wiseau, like, now he's saying

402
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,400
that it's like a dark comedy, but at 100%

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
was not intended to be a dark comedy.

404
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,800
So those things, that's totally true.

405
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,120
I have a sincere, I legitimately love

406
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
that film and love the characters

407
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,560
in a, in a very real way, but it is not

408
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,120
what was like supposed to happen, you know.

409
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,360
So I just feel like the rules apply

410
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,680
slightly differently in a situation like that.

411
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,800
You know what I'm saying?

412
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,360
Is that fair?

413
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,320
Uh, maybe you're still gay.

414
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
I want to understand you.

415
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
If I could provide a more nuanced perspective

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
into this, I think I could really educate

417
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
you people on the true, the true meaning

418
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
of irony, I guess.

419
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,280
I want to agree with what Nate was saying

420
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,000
at the beginning.

421
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,040
One of these fucking dictionary thumpers.

422
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I want to take it a step further and go

423
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,840
ahead and say that irony is, is a disgusting

424
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,680
bottom dwelling form of comedy.

425
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
And really irony and sarcasm is what,

426
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
it's, it's how 14 year old girls

427
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
communicate with each other.

428
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,560
So how can we as professional comedian

429
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,760
adults even consider irony to be something

430
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
that we should use in our arts, in our comedy?

431
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
I think it's really pathetic that we're

432
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,320
even discussing this.

433
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,200
Dumb, you're dumb.

434
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
That's like saying, that's like saying,

435
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
that's like saying a fart joke is always

436
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
inappropriate because it's low breath.

437
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
No, what monkey has never used irony or

438
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
sarcasm in his fucking videos.

439
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,400
I would never use irony.

440
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm sincere.

441
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm nearly on like a fucking higher plane

442
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,440
than us.

443
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,360
No, Monty knows what he's talking about.

444
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
I've always been wholesome in all my videos

445
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,040
and I kind of look down on anybody who

446
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,520
uses irony and sarcasm as a crutch for

447
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,920
their comedy.

448
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,400
Exactly.

449
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
This is funny because just and Nate

450
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
were being totally sincere.

451
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,560
I know.

452
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,800
And Monty and Monty would be totally ironic

453
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,360
and sarcastic.

454
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,240
I understood.

455
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,800
After that.

456
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,520
Woo!

457
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
Press one if you love Munchie and Monkey

458
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
separately, not the same person.

459
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,560
The same, the same guy, right?

460
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,680
Press one if you love that one guy.

461
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
No, damn it.

462
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
You know, speaking of Monkey and why I

463
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,040
hate him, and this is actually pertinent

464
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,920
to this topic, because I was having a

465
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,080
conversation, a debate with Monkey earlier

466
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
because I was watching one of his

467
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Countdown to Suicide videos and he was

468
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,000
talking about, oh when Monkey's anime

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
reviews is over, I might just start a

470
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,800
series called Jimmy's Reviews so that

471
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,120
people know it's a more serious

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,840
reviews.

473
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,480
And I said, Monkey, you make me goddamn

474
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,960
sick.

475
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
First of all, coddling these parasites

476
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
by trying to make your channel more

477
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,080
accessible.

478
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
And second of all, how dare you put a

479
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
fucking a line of separation and say

480
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,800
this is the funny wacky satire videos

481
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,880
and these are the serious videos that

482
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
makes me so it makes me just just burn

483
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,920
with unbridled rage that anyone

484
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
would imply that there should be a

485
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
separation between the two.

486
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
You gotta, the best part about your

487
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
videos is that when there's a sincere

488
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
video, like an Elliot Roger video or a

489
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
bobo bobo video, that it's mixed in,

490
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,440
it's hidden in this sea of wacky

491
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,000
insanity with nothing to discern it at

492
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,120
a surface glance.

493
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
That's what makes it all the more

494
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,040
valid, even more valid than it would be

495
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
anyways, because you gotta have it

496
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,520
together.

497
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,440
You can't, I'm vehemently, violently

498
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
against the idea of making anything

499
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,000
accessible for these fucking rodents,

500
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
these leeches who watch the videos

501
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
and demand, no, you gotta take off your

502
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
mouth, you gotta have a human face,

503
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,000
Momke, you gotta be Jimmy and make

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,040
use for Jimmy.

505
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, Jesse, is that mostly the reason

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,680
why you don't like the audience having

507
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,440
an easy time, like you don't want it to

508
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,920
be accessible?

509
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,440
Is that the only reason or is it just

510
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
part of the reason why?

511
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
I just plain don't like the audience, I

512
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,800
want them to be sad.

513
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,480
Alright, I understand.

514
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,560
I want them to not enjoy anything ever.

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,320
You know, that's, I see your point there,

516
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,080
and there's definitely something to be

517
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
gained by creating a danker cloud of

518
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
illusion to keep you fully understanding.

519
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
Maybe I'm completely misrepresenting

520
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
Momke's intention anyways, which I think

521
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
I am, but going with that asinine

522
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,680
example, I...

523
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,320
Yeah, if I can respond, Jess, I'm kind of

524
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,760
hurt because I think you're misinterpreting

525
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
really the point of all my videos.

526
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,560
As I said a second ago, I'm not trying to be

527
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,440
wacky or anything.

528
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
I've been sincere in every single video

529
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
I've made, so that you think that there's

530
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
such a line of distinction.

531
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,920
Oh, you're being ironic again!

532
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,280
I take back my apology!

533
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
You do get apology from me!

534
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,760
Fuck you!

535
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,680
You're trying to fucking satire me,

536
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
and I won't have it!

537
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,240
I invented satire, buddy!

538
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
This proves that irony is a purely

539
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
destructive force.

540
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,120
It corrodes the human soul!

541
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,760
Like about Hippo as the character

542
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
making his own like terrible videos that

543
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
are stupid because he's...

544
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
I love that idea.

545
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
But I was thinking of making it on another

546
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
channel, but I don't know whether

547
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,120
that's a good idea.

548
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,240
No, put it on Hippocrite.

549
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,080
I guess I should, but it's just...

550
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
Vito that, Vito that.

551
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,720
I am the number one advocate for Hippo.

552
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,560
The thing is, the thing is, I understand

553
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
there's an advantage just in general,

554
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
just for, I mean, I like it when

555
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
certain types of content are split up,

556
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
so I don't get annoyed when it's like,

557
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
you know, there's a guy I follow,

558
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,320
and then he's doing all this stuff,

559
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,440
and I'm like, yeah, I like this stuff,

560
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
and then he starts uploading stuff

561
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
that I don't like on that channel.

562
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm like, well, okay,

563
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
it's just a...

564
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
I like separating channels.

565
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,920
I mean, we all have like multiple channels for things.

566
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah, but Hippo, what segment of your audience

567
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
wouldn't love a Hippo review?

568
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,040
Well, yeah, I mean, that's why.

569
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,520
That's true.

570
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
I guess to clarify my asinine point

571
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
about what I was saying about Mumki or whatever,

572
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
I don't even fucking remember what I was saying.

573
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,640
I just think that irony and sincerity

574
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,080
are both equally valid,

575
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
and they're all the more valid

576
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,520
when they can work in tandem

577
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,240
and be together as a delicious little stew,

578
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,080
as opposed to seeing it as opposites.

579
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Well, I still have to disagree.

580
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,920
I have to go with Nate and say,

581
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,840
it's only valid and entertaining

582
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,280
if it has sincerity,

583
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,040
and if this stupid dumb cartoon

584
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
makes me cry at the end.

585
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
Otherwise, why would I even watch it?

586
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
Right, I see that you're making fun of me,

587
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
but you're not gonna get the nuances

588
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,800
of my point here, Mumki.

589
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,240
What I'm trying to say is that

590
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
what we're talking about here are two different things.

591
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,560
We're talking about two...

592
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,000
They're not opposites.

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,680
It's not like you can only have one or the other.

594
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,440
I'm talking about these are two tools

595
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,280
that every creator has in their toolbox

596
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,920
that they can utilize to whatever extents they want.

597
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,720
So it's like...

598
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
You know, when you're making something like

599
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,280
fucking a My Little Pony review,

600
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
like you can have a sincere opinion

601
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
that you're presenting in whatever way you want,

602
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
but you can also make fun of the fact

603
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
that you're watching this fucking show.

604
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,800
Did somebody say My Little Pony reviews?

605
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,960
It's me drowning in horseshoes.

606
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
Oh my God!

607
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
The original shitty, endless, just character.

608
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,920
A horseshoe good boy.

609
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,560
I...

610
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,680
Oh my God.

611
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,640
You know, that's...

612
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
Brony's are dumb and I don't like him.

613
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,760
Pope Corona is a guy he lives in my house, I guess.

614
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,520
Fuck you.

615
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,360
Goodbye.

616
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Wow, that's real.

617
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,280
Nate.

618
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,840
Wow, you don't have to say never meet your heroes

619
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
because they'll always disappoint you.

620
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,840
But let me tell you, he did not disappoint.

621
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
That cameo was truly top game.

622
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
But Nate, real quick in response to your example,

623
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,800
I wasn't around during the dark times,

624
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,320
so please correct me if I'm wrong.

625
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,120
But aren't you doing a little bit of revisionist history there

626
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,880
saying, oh, I was watching ponies ironically, guys, all along.

627
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

628
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,160
You're thinking, you're not, you're looking at

629
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,760
in too black and white of a picture

630
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
because there was nuance here all the time.

631
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,600
I legitimately loved that show for around four seasons.

632
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
I legitimately loved it.

633
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,280
At the same time, I was also aware

634
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,320
that there is this perception of people who watch the show

635
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
as artistic retards.

636
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,880
And I am able to both appreciate the show

637
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,600
and love every single aspect of the show itself

638
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,880
while also acknowledging and laughing at myself

639
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
for just being a part of this cultural phenomenon

640
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,240
where people think that it's just funny and stupid or whatever.

641
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,520
I have always maintained, even back during my pony days,

642
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,760
that the My Little Pony fandom, for all of its

643
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,960
faults and flaws of which there are many,

644
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,840
nevertheless, is more based more in sincerity

645
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
than it is in irony.

646
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
The fans absolutely.

647
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,560
And I maintain that to this day.

648
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,840
And then I myself, there's nothing ironic about it.

649
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,280
I still like My Little Pony.

650
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm not as up to date with it as I once was.

651
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,560
I don't care as much as I once did.

652
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,240
But I still like it, sincerely.

653
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,400
I still to this day will watch some of the episodes

654
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
and ball my fucking eyes out at the sheer majesty.

655
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,280
Fucking, I don't need to go through every episode,

656
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,640
but I love the show.

657
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
It is a great show.

658
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,160
Some of the episodes are some of the best I've ever seen,

659
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,920
literally, some of the best I've ever seen.

660
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,440
And that's it.

661
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,680
And at the same time, I also find it amusing that I, you know,

662
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,480
let's just make this podcast a clip show

663
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,800
of like all of our favorite My Little Pony episodes.

664
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,120
Remember the time when the cutie markers sayers

665
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
finally got their cutie marks.

666
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
That's the best episode of the fucking show.

667
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
That is the best episode.

668
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,200
But, Nate, I'm still a little confused, Nate.

669
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,000
Are you fucking serious?

670
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
If you're giving a genuine review over it,

671
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,040
like just because you acknowledge that some bronies are bad,

672
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,680
how is that ironic that you're reviewing it

673
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,880
if you're being genuine with it?

674
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,800
Okay, you're obviously just trying to confuse,

675
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,360
I don't know.

676
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't know why you're playing dumb at this point

677
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,080
because you obviously get it.

678
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,000
What's the irony in giving a sincere review of something?

679
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
Okay, here's the thing.

680
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,040
This could all be easily explained if you watched,

681
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
I don't know, Phantom Reviews or K-Reviews

682
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
or any of fucking Jesse's videos.

683
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,280
But he's not a real PCP members.

684
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,360
So he would never do that.

685
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,520
You should have known, monkey,

686
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
when we handed you the sealed golden envelope

687
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,680
containing your invitation to the PCP,

688
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,200
you should have known to do your research,

689
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,960
go back to the sacred texts and the ancient volumes

690
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,920
and go through the playlist of all of our separate sagas

691
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,720
together and separately and watch everything.

692
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,520
You, Rube, there is-

693
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,760
I can say sincerely that I didn't realize that,

694
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,280
I mean, I knew bronies were like lambasted for being like gay,

695
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,000
but I knew that it wasn't true because it was just a good show.

696
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
So when I started doing the reviews,

697
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,160
I was just doing it because it was a thing

698
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,000
that people in the community did.

699
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
I didn't really think of it too much as like,

700
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,920
you know, wow, this is really dumb

701
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
because it's like, I don't know.

702
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
People have been reviewing games and movies

703
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
and stuff from their childhood for a long time,

704
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,120
things that aren't necessarily for them.

705
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,720
I don't know.

706
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,880
It didn't seem as any any weirder than like that guy with the glasses.

707
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,680
In the video that I made,

708
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,440
Keg reviews putting your hoof down.

709
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,160
It opens, the video opens with a scene of Keg

710
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,200
talking about how he is a high schooler

711
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,960
and how just that day he had smashed innumerable puts.

712
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,360
All right.

713
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,160
That's what happens at the beginning of that episode.

714
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
And then he spends like 10 minutes

715
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,560
reviewing a fucking My Little Pony episode.

716
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
At the end of that video,

717
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,440
he then reveals that actually this entire thing was a lie.

718
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
He is actually a complete nerd,

719
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,040
or he was because this is a flashback.

720
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,920
He was a fucking nerd who everyone calls gay

721
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,680
because he doesn't have sex with women.

722
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,720
And then he spends that he then,

723
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,800
he then sincerely celebrates this show in the context of this review

724
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,480
for, you know, he met this character Iron Will.

725
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
It made him a real man.

726
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
Watching this episode of My Little Pony

727
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
made this character Keg a real man.

728
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,920
That is a both sincere and ironic way

729
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,160
to appreciate and interpret this episode.

730
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
And if you can't see that,

731
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,040
I don't know what to tell you, buddy,

732
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,960
because I can't feel any clearer than that.

733
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,320
I look down on irony so much

734
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,400
that I can't even recognize it anymore.

735
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Fair enough.

736
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,920
We all have our disabilities.

737
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
Some of the motionability to others.

738
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,680
I wouldn't expect a fucking simian

739
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,560
to understand complex human emotions and concepts.

740
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,840
I think when it comes to comedy,

741
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm standing way up here on a pillar

742
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,280
and all you people using irony for jokes

743
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,240
are like ants to me.

744
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
I can't even recognize what's happening down there.

745
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm standing on a pillar, then I'm standing on the...

746
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,200
Oh, yes.

747
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
The bedside dresser on the duvet in the mattress.

748
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm standing on the mattress.

749
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm standing down inside of a manhole.

750
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,960
Monkey is the all-time greatest comedian.

751
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,040
We know that because the most impressive joke he ever did

752
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,520
was pointing out that he only has five jokes.

753
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,200
Yeah.

754
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah.

755
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,320
Very impressive.

756
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
There's nothing ironic about that.

757
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
It was a sincere joke.

758
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,400
As we've seen here on this podcast,

759
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,920
he is a master of the joke of pretending to be retarded.

760
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,680
He really knocks that one out of the...

761
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
Is he a master of it, though,

762
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,760
or is he just sincerely retarded?

763
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,400
The fact that we don't know proves his mastery.

764
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,840
That's, you know...

765
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
I hope you guys are being ironic

766
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,440
because this is sincerely hurting my feelings.

767
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
This is the worst conversation ever.

768
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,560
Everyone's just starting to fucking out irony each other

769
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,640
and nothing makes any goddamn sense.

770
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,160
I haven't said anything ironic

771
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,920
because I'm the only good boy.

772
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,760
That's true.

773
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,440
Hashtag good boy.

774
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,040
Okay, but see, that's interesting.

775
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,000
We didn't get into the nuance,

776
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,720
but I wanted to clarify how before when I said that

777
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,560
like irony is a destructive tool,

778
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,920
that's not me criticizing it.

779
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,480
That is just me pointing out that what irony is

780
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
is making fun of something.

781
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Which is a purely destructive act.

782
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,160
There is nothing being built.

783
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I think making fun of somebody to be constructed.

784
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,360
It's like, could you call Dynamite a construction tool?

785
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,800
No, it's a demolition tool.

786
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,520
You could.

787
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah, you need...

788
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,160
Oh, shut the fuck up.

789
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040
If you need to build a railway through a mountain,

790
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,160
you use Dynamite.

791
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
But that's exactly my point.

792
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
It is a tool you use to get rid of something

793
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
so that then you can come in with other tools

794
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,320
to build something up there.

795
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,960
So if I'm going around and I'm saying like,

796
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,280
oh, you know, women are all retarded and gay.

797
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,160
I'm saying that.

798
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,040
And then someone says like,

799
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,440
look at me, women are retarded and gay.

800
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,640
Look at that guy, he's so gay.

801
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,840
This is me mocking him.

802
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,680
That's me, you know, making fun of that guy

803
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,320
to destroy his argument with my hilarious joke.

804
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,600
Which is what he just said in a retarded voice.

805
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
So that someone then can later on suppose like,

806
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,920
you know what, maybe women aren't all retarded and gay.

807
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,760
And then one's like, yeah, I'm with that guy.

808
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,040
That guy would be an idiot.

809
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,160
But like, okay, the fucking Dynamite analogy.

810
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
Is Dynamite not still then valuable

811
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,800
and should be cherished for doing its job

812
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
into help create a better future?

813
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Of course, which is why, yeah, we are nebulous topic.

814
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Can we just talk about like what animes we like

815
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,760
some time on this fucking show?

816
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,280
Didn't this used to be a show about like fun stuff?

817
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,560
Jesse, you hated anime.

818
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:48,880
No, we do.

819
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
You hate anime more than anyone I've ever met, Jesse.

820
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,720
What are you saying to me right now?

821
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,280
Now all we do is have these weird circular philosophical

822
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,720
discussions about the fucking nature of art and reality

823
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
and our place in the universe.

824
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
And I can't take it anymore.

825
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,280
It's making me too smart.

826
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,040
My brain's gonna explode.

827
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,360
You're wind too intelligent for the PCP.

828
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm gonna ascend beyond my mortal human body

829
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,840
before I wanted to.

830
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm not done cooking yet.

831
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,680
If it happens prematurely,

832
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,440
it'll be bad for the universe.

833
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
The PCP is like Aang

834
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
when he was opening his eight chakras

835
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
and we're about, we're right at the stage

836
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
before that cosmic chakra.

837
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
We're right there.

838
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,200
We need to, we can't, we can't.

839
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,280
We're fucking asleep to a high level of Christ consciousness.

840
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,760
That's right.

841
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,440
We can't leave Katara just yet.

842
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm not ready.

843
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm not ready.

844
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm too goddamn strong in this podcast.

845
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,040
Oh my god.

846
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,520
If we go too far, we will lose all attachments

847
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,480
to both earthly desires.

848
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,400
Which just means my piss has been released from my body.

849
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,240
No.

850
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
I can't stop it.

851
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,160
My cock is turning into a lemon pie.

852
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,200
The lies.

853
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
Do you think it would be good if we discussed that?

854
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,840
Now you know the truth.

855
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm actually a level eight Christ consciousness bee.

856
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
That's why I'm so powerful.

857
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh my god.

858
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,200
Get in the fuck out of here.

859
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Before this goes to a complete clusterfuck,

860
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,920
I was gonna ask,

861
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,160
since all five of us have created things before,

862
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,880
should we talk about the ways in which we have used irony

863
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
and sincerity within the things we've created

864
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,440
that all of our loving fans watch and enjoy?

865
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Please.

866
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,760
Please.

867
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,560
I don't want to start.

868
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
I already gave an example.

869
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,720
Yeah.

870
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,480
I'll give an example of the irony in my art

871
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,640
that I haven't made yet.

872
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,120
No, god damn it.

873
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,080
Hippo was saying something.

874
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
I want to hear Hippo.

875
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Well, I was just going to say I'm not smart

876
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
and I don't know what I do.

877
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,560
I don't know whether it's sincere or ironic.

878
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,360
I just, I like video games and I say this is a good one.

879
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,240
That's perfectly fine.

880
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,840
I like the way you do things.

881
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,000
And sometimes you can't tell if it's sincere or ironic.

882
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
That's great.

883
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,240
I really like that.

884
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,440
I don't know either.

885
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm probably sincere the whole time, but I don't know.

886
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,640
Remember, you're opening to the Driver 2 video

887
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,040
where it just shows you rocking out to that fucking song.

888
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,680
That is both funny because it's silly

889
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
and also I'm sure that you just like that song

890
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
because I fucking like that song.

891
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,640
Yeah.

892
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,320
So it's that kind of middle ground.

893
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
Well, I think it's just that I make fun of myself

894
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,720
because I'm lame, but when I do silly things,

895
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,000
it's not because I'm ironically enjoying anything

896
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
or I'm just trying to say, yeah, this is silly.

897
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm just trying to say that I'm silly

898
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
and this is how I react sincerely to things that I like.

899
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Like what in your other video for the Fire Emblem,

900
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,000
we're at the end.

901
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,960
Oh, guys, this is my favorite.

902
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,600
When you're playing all the Florina voice clips

903
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,920
and then at the end, you just make that face at the very end.

904
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,240
You're like, ooh, and then it ends.

905
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
I've watched that like 20 times.

906
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,760
This is my favorite.

907
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,360
I have a question in reference to Hippo's comedy

908
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,920
because I think a lot of the times he'll do a joke

909
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,600
that is intentionally really bad,

910
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,440
but like it's still really funny.

911
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,840
So does that count as an ironic joke

912
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,960
because it's bad on purpose

913
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,760
or is it a sincere joke because it's sincerely funny too?

914
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,280
There's a, I think there's two ways those happen.

915
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,920
One is that I write a joke and it sucks,

916
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
but I don't realize it until I'm recording it

917
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,480
and then in editing, try to make it funny by timing it right.

918
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
Other times, I don't know.

919
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,640
I think I'm just not good at making some jokes.

920
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,200
I'm not sure.

921
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
No, but I think even in improv,

922
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,680
you just, you say really dumb things in a funny way

923
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,360
on purpose all the time.

924
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,880
And it's really funny to me.

925
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Yeah, you say a lot of stupid shit.

926
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,040
Yeah, and I think what we're saying is

927
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,640
we're going to kick you out of the PCP.

928
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,080
Oh, I think I start with Travis.

929
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,920
We're on a roll lately.

930
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
They're dropping like flies these days.

931
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,880
So we're down to just this five now.

932
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
Everyone else is dead.

933
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,120
The five's best going to be the end of Taylor.

934
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,640
So, I mean, did anybody have any specific ironic jokes?

935
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
I want to hear Jess give me his spiel

936
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,720
because he's very passionate about this.

937
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,040
I am a man with many a spiel, that is true.

938
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,640
You know, I think that, I think all my content

939
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,040
is pretty much completely sincere all the time.

940
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,760
I mean, maybe more than people realize,

941
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
like maybe like 300% sincere.

942
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,320
That's a lot.

943
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,120
I think, you know, like my message is sincere.

944
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,600
My everything is sincere.

945
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,440
The only thing that's ironic occasionally

946
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
is like my delivery is ironic.

947
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,840
But even when my delivery is ironic,

948
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
all the other stuff behind it

949
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,240
and swirling around it is still sincere.

950
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,200
I value sincerity a lot, a lot.

951
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
Wait, how did, I guess I'm just dumb

952
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,120
because I don't know what it means

953
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,680
to have an ironic way to tell something sincerely.

954
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
I don't either.

955
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,480
This is a dumb topic and I don't like it.

956
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,280
I don't get it.

957
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,440
Well, whatever.

958
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
For example, I mean, the only time,

959
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
I mean, the times when I like my videos

960
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,800
are like the most ironic, I guess,

961
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,080
are like stuff with the kayfabe commander.

962
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,600
Because like...

963
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,880
Well, those aren't sincere.

964
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
What the fuck?

965
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,400
Oh no, the message behind the kayfabe commander

966
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,280
is very sincere.

967
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,160
He's really strong.

968
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,960
He'll beat you up.

969
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,640
He's like the evil.

970
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,720
All of his opinions are undoubtedly the worst.

971
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,680
Right.

972
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,760
But like the philosophy behind those skits

973
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
when I first started incorporating that character

974
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
was because I was just genuinely so like worn out

975
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,280
from like years of like trying to do YouTube good.

976
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
That like with the kayfabe commander,

977
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,440
it's just like I just want this to be blatantly obviously

978
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
not like not even trying.

979
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
So like whenever you see the kayfabe commander

980
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,920
in one of my videos,

981
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,600
nothing involving the kayfabe commander

982
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
is ever scripted or written.

983
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
I just let him come out and fucking ramble.

984
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,240
And then I ramble and I always,

985
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I deliberately put on this like bad acting,

986
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,760
acting because I think that in the past,

987
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,240
I've shown myself to be a somewhat capable actor

988
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,680
when I actually try.

989
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,560
But whenever it's a dumb skit like that now,

990
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,560
for me, it's more funny to just like blatantly put

991
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,240
like no enthusiasm in it.

992
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Like, oh God, the fucking kayfabe commander,

993
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,080
he's here again or some shit.

994
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,640
Just like leave like flubs in and just have him over there.

995
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
Like, I'm gonna suck a thousand dicks today

996
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
and then beat you up and then suck more dicks

997
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,120
and beat you up again.

998
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,320
It's just, I love it when you do that.

999
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,120
Those are great.

1000
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,360
Jess, we were talking about this very thing

1001
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,880
on My Spyro Let's Play.

1002
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
And you said that you're sort of trying to go

1003
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
for a parody of people like Movie Bob

1004
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
who would throw in just retarded skits

1005
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
into their review videos

1006
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
and just kind of playing off of that.

1007
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,480
Yeah, exactly.

1008
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,560
So I can see how irony is being both

1009
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
constructive and destructive.

1010
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,640
It's a sincere satirical point,

1011
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
but it has to be delivered ironically

1012
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
because that is the point, I guess.

1013
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,640
Yeah.

1014
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,360
And if you're a fan of those,

1015
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,080
and if you're a fan of those terrible skits,

1016
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,520
oh boy, have I got an extra terrible one coming soon.

1017
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,120
It might be out in a time you hear this.

1018
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,000
I kind of want to make skits that are sincere,

1019
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,800
like actually emotional, like because most of the time

1020
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,120
they're playful laughs, whether they're ironic or not.

1021
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,320
Yee.

1022
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,880
I don't know.

1023
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,280
Dude, frankly, it's way harder to make sincere ones

1024
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,680
than ironic ones.

1025
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, definitely.

1026
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
This is like a thousand times harder.

1027
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,640
That's why Monkey so puts so much work in his videos

1028
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,920
because he has to make everything so sincere and passionate.

1029
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,280
Yeah, I work really hard to make sure

1030
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
it's not like ham-fisted or corny.

1031
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,120
I have to make everything as sincere as I can.

1032
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,120
I mean, the production value on Monkey's anti-reviews

1033
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,040
is just so fucking out of this world.

1034
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm surprised he has any free time to record the PCP.

1035
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,040
I really don't.

1036
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,760
He's just fucking hammering out shit, dude.

1037
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
Well, Monkey's young.

1038
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,160
He still has that work ethic that I once had,

1039
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
that many of us, I'm sure, once had.

1040
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,320
But he'll be cured of that soon enough.

1041
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,680
Thank God.

1042
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,160
You know, I was thinking...

1043
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,760
My favorite Monkey universe character is Grandma.

1044
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,160
She's...

1045
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,760
She's...

1046
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,280
There's that bit of sincerity, you know?

1047
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
Where'd you get the Grandma mask, by the way?

1048
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,120
Where'd you get that whole Grandma from?

1049
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,240
I find them in parts.

1050
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
I can't put together a whole one yet.

1051
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,080
I went on Craig's list and I said I'm looking for a Grandma

1052
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,920
for these videos and she volunteered.

1053
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,440
That's awesome.

1054
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,920
Excellent.

1055
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,560
That's beautiful.

1056
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
Wait, is that actually true?

1057
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,240
Yeah, yeah, that's not my real Grandma.

1058
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,200
I just found her on Craig's list.

1059
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,520
What?

1060
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1061
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,560
Is that actually real?

1062
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,320
Are you telling me that that being did not spring forth

1063
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
from your furnace room?

1064
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm not gonna show my real Grandma all that weird anime porn,

1065
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
should I just found some actress online?

1066
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Oh my God, I had no...

1067
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,680
Okay, okay.

1068
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
Wow, that's a bombshell.

1069
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
Stop the meming for just a second.

1070
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,120
Is that actually...

1071
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,800
Is that...

1072
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,920
Is that real?

1073
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,400
Of course.

1074
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,440
Oh, he's fucking with us.

1075
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,600
He's fucking with us.

1076
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,960
He's being too ironic right now.

1077
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,600
I don't know.

1078
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:05,680
I really don't know.

1079
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,920
I already fucking strained the PCP.

1080
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,440
I told you it's a destructive force.

1081
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,920
It's like...

1082
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,440
It's like my power level is so...

1083
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
You know, hey, what ironic thing I think, Jesse,

1084
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,560
is that I think over the years you and I specifically

1085
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,400
have tried to make really good videos

1086
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,040
and ironically, those were really bad YouTube videos.

1087
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,400
Yeah, yeah, that's a...

1088
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
Yeah, that's a true thing.

1089
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,000
Don't make that mistake, folks.

1090
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
Be a shale.

1091
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,840
Be a hack.

1092
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,200
Make garbage like monkey.

1093
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,240
Monkey's doing it all right.

1094
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Monkey's kind of straight from the get-go.

1095
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,200
Wait, so, Ben, are you...

1096
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,480
I mean, I'm Nate.

1097
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:42,880
Sorry.

1098
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,680
Are you all right?

1099
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
Wait, just go, Ben.

1100
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,800
I am not a worm.

1101
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
I am not the scum of the earth.

1102
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,120
I am not a little piece of shit, all right?

1103
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,960
You will never do that again to me.

1104
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,560
You're just both so suck and similar.

1105
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,920
You're just like the same person, baby.

1106
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,800
Shut up, monkey.

1107
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,760
I don't even like you.

1108
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,600
All right, what's your question, buddy boy?

1109
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,480
Are you saying you're not a hack fraud in every way, Ben?

1110
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
Oh, I'm saying that I'm doing my best to become a hack fraud.

1111
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,880
You know, I've been releasing your comic on time.

1112
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,520
Seriously.

1113
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,800
Wait, what?

1114
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,240
You're not even releasing your comic on a fucking insistent basis.

1115
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,960
Shut up!

1116
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't do comics.

1117
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,280
That's not me.

1118
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,040
I'm not a comic guy.

1119
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
The only guys who are gay do comics.

1120
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,440
The only guy who's a comic guy is Piccolo.

1121
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,680
I don't.

1122
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,400
Are you talking about that comic?

1123
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,200
No, wait, that's NAMIC.

1124
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,080
I fucked it up.

1125
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,960
What's comic from?

1126
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,760
Comic is the, well, comic was the...

1127
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
God damn it, I don't remember.

1128
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,720
I don't remember either.

1129
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,040
Dragon Ball Z is gay, because it's from Japan.

1130
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
It's from Japan, so it's gay, it's bad.

1131
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,800
All right, I don't know what the fucking Nate's point was,

1132
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,440
which was a good point before it got fucking derailed.

1133
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,920
Yeah.

1134
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,080
But fucking Piccolo and whatever.

1135
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,560
Um...

1136
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,360
Yeah, I mean, I fucking...

1137
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,120
Like, I don't ever want a video on my channel ever again

1138
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,120
that's over 10 minutes long,

1139
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,600
because it's just the wrong way to do it.

1140
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,240
It's bad.

1141
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,880
Well, hey, doing it just at 10 minutes is good,

1142
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,240
because then you could put an ad at the end,

1143
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,200
and you gotta do that.

1144
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,080
Like, some of the stuff I've been doing more recently,

1145
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,720
like some of the better fuck videos

1146
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
are like the Not A Review series.

1147
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
Like, those are great.

1148
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,480
Almost no effort goes into those,

1149
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,800
and there are a million times better YouTube videos

1150
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,800
than stuff I used to work on day and night for 40 hours.

1151
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
I just didn't know.

1152
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
I didn't know how to play the game back then.

1153
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,440
I still don't, but maybe I'll learn someday.

1154
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,960
My Kingdom Hearts videos are my attempt to do that,

1155
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
and it's so easy.

1156
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,000
It's so...

1157
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,840
I didn't realize it could be this easy.

1158
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,880
It's insanity, and it's what people want.

1159
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,640
You know, it's what YouTube wants, at least.

1160
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,120
It's crazy.

1161
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,000
So, I guess sincerity is strong.

1162
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,480
I'm still struggling with being able to not do big things.

1163
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
It's just, you know?

1164
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,320
I think we're growing, you know?

1165
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,760
I think we're learning the game a little bit.

1166
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
We're becoming pros on this pro-crastinators podcast.

1167
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,240
You're witnessing it, folks.

1168
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,560
It's funny.

1169
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,320
You're witnessing a chrysalis bursting

1170
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,840
into a beautiful boober fly with big, saggy tits.

1171
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,080
Really great point, Phantom Horn.

1172
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,120
Anyway, to continue.

1173
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,080
SHUT THEM!

1174
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,280
It's funny, because my comic I'm working on now

1175
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,520
is fairly big, but I've always had the philosophy

1176
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,480
that just a ton of small things is good,

1177
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:28,960
and I like that more than big things.

1178
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,920
That's why web comics with more or less daily releases

1179
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,800
are quickly home stuck.

1180
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,840
It was popular with that.

1181
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,600
Release in one panel.

1182
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,720
Well, I don't mean like that.

1183
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,200
I'm not directly like Steven Bombs in the release schedule.

1184
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,760
But having small, contained stories that go on

1185
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,920
for just as long as they need to,

1186
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,760
and then have a definitive ending,

1187
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
that you can wrap up in a neat little bow

1188
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,360
that has a nice cover and you would pick them

1189
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,360
in a bookstore, I like that.

1190
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,680
I used to want to make every video like,

1191
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,520
I'm going to review this thing.

1192
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,880
So I'm going to make a huge, in-depth, sprawling,

1193
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,560
30-minute review analysis,

1194
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
and I'm going to touch on every little,

1195
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,640
tiny aspect of it in the ultimate video.

1196
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,520
And because that's the way I approached making videos,

1197
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,640
well, what happened is,

1198
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,360
either the video would never get around to being made

1199
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,480
because it would become too massive in the writing phase,

1200
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,280
or I would miraculously get the video made,

1201
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,400
and nobody would watch it

1202
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,640
because it was a giant 30-minute,

1203
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,560
non-marketable piece of shit.

1204
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,760
The correct way to do it, I now understand,

1205
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,960
is instead of making a massive video touching on everything,

1206
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,840
you just make little videos about the specific subjects,

1207
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,560
and you can make as many of those as you want.

1208
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,320
You can make them in a fucking day,

1209
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,440
and you can have hundreds of them out every day forever,

1210
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,960
and everyone wants to watch them,

1211
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,720
and that's how you become a real boy.

1212
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,200
Yeah, it seems to be that there is still like a market

1213
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,480
for huge videos,

1214
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,600
but they have to be spectacularly huge

1215
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,600
in order to get a lot of views,

1216
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:04,640
like Mathematosis doing like a 40-minute review

1217
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,240
of Mario 64, and then a review of every other Mario.

1218
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,040
Like they have to be huge, or they have to be tiny.

1219
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,600
You can't really sort of make a 30-minute, 20-minute...

1220
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,880
You know, I was looking at some old documents of mine,

1221
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,520
and looking at stuff I never finished,

1222
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,040
and I found this old massive, massive,

1223
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,880
Mass Effect 3 analysis that I wrote when it came out.

1224
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,480
This giant, this rage-fueled tirade of a review,

1225
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,080
and it was like a million pages long,

1226
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,200
and it touched on everything.

1227
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,240
Like, oh, the ending is bad,

1228
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,880
and Tally's face reveal is bad, and this is bad,

1229
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,920
but I never got around to making the video,

1230
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,440
because it became too much.

1231
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,720
I wrote too much, but now I'm looking at it

1232
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,120
in my old documents, and I'm going,

1233
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,400
you know, I could still make a video

1234
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,520
about why Tally's face reveal still makes me mad,

1235
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,560
or a video about why the ending still makes me mad.

1236
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,880
I could chop it up into these little segments,

1237
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,800
and it would love that Tally's face one.

1238
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,400
Like, I could easily do that, and instead of one Mass Effect video

1239
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,720
that nobody watches, because it's an hour long,

1240
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,160
I could have 10 Mass Effect 3 videos that everybody watches,

1241
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,760
because they're easy and accessible,

1242
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
and brilliant and nice and fun,

1243
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,600
and works better with the YouTube algorithm.

1244
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
It's better in literally every way.

1245
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,800
You know, I think I've been trying to do that with the Rayman.

1246
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
Once I've finished part three,

1247
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,760
any other big video is going to be in parts,

1248
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,880
and then later I'll stitch it together into one video,

1249
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,520
so it will come out slowly, but not too slowly.

1250
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,920
Ooh, I like that idea of stitching them together later

1251
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,760
into one video for the people who want to see it.

1252
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,280
That's a good idea.

1253
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,120
I agree with everything you guys are saying,

1254
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,520
but I think the one needle in the haystack,

1255
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,200
just specifically for you guys, is that it's the Patreon.

1256
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,800
It's that you charge people per video.

1257
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,200
So, you want to make something that's big and grand

1258
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,560
to justify charging them.

1259
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,240
If you make 100 small videos, you might have some problems.

1260
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,520
You know what I'm saying?

1261
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,240
I can confirm that most people don't care.

1262
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,120
Well, they definitely don't want Jesse.

1263
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,520
People have proved they will pay Jesse for anything.

1264
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,480
It doesn't matter.

1265
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,360
The good thing about Patreon is that,

1266
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,960
as you make more videos in the month,

1267
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
the people who've capped increases.

1268
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,560
So, you can make eight videos,

1269
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,360
and by the eighth video, you're not really ripping anyone off

1270
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,360
because the only people who aren't capped

1271
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,600
are people who are like $1 pledgers at that point,

1272
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,960
so no one really fucking cares.

1273
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,720
Anything I make is worth $1, so...

1274
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
The people who are pledging $5 or $10

1275
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,880
are only getting charged once or twice.

1276
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,880
I feel pretty strongly about this.

1277
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,640
There's some discussion I hear about what you owe

1278
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,920
your patrons and stuff, but I really, truly feel

1279
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,360
the responsibility, if I post a garbage video

1280
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,520
and I charge for it, I sincerely feel

1281
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,120
it is the responsibility of the patrons to watch that

1282
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,240
and determine if it is something

1283
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,680
that is deserving of their money or not.

1284
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,560
And don't get me wrong.

1285
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,600
There is a level of trust that you have to maintain,

1286
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,240
but I'm just saying, this shouldn't be thought of as like,

1287
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:21,840
I am like an icon of virtue, and as a patron guy,

1288
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,360
I always make great shit.

1289
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,720
And then if I break that contract,

1290
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,120
it's like I have committed a grievous sin.

1291
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,400
I don't like to think about it that way.

1292
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,800
I like to think about it in terms of market forces.

1293
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,440
Am I supplying a product that people are willing to pay for?

1294
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,960
If so, they will give me money.

1295
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,520
If I betray the market expectations,

1296
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,240
I will be penalized because people will stop patroning me.

1297
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,320
I just really don't like this whole idea

1298
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,040
of lionizing the Patreon creators,

1299
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,840
as if they're so perfect all the time.

1300
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,720
When they're really just people trying to survive

1301
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,920
doing what they're doing.

1302
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,000
That's the anxiety I've had.

1303
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,600
I haven't had a lot of people leave,

1304
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,040
but there's been occasionally just one person

1305
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,720
like go from five dollars to one dollar,

1306
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,400
and that's enough to make me go,

1307
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,240
oh no, I've ruined everything.

1308
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,480
My reputation's gone.

1309
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,080
I'm homeless now.

1310
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,200
We should definitely add to all this discussion,

1311
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,840
the caveat or the disclaimer.

1312
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,000
Don't anybody unpledged from us ever?

1313
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,640
Don't anyone?

1314
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,040
Never.

1315
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,600
Don't do it.

1316
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,640
Don't unpledge.

1317
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,080
We need your money to stay alive,

1318
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,800
especially me.

1319
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,840
I sleep in garbage.

1320
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,880
My life is hell.

1321
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,600
Don't unpledge.

1322
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,800
Don't edit your pledge lower.

1323
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,360
Don't do it.

1324
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,000
I'll die.

1325
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,120
I'll die.

1326
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,840
I'll die.

1327
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Jess is a sewer priest and ghetto spiritualist.

1328
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,000
He needs your money more than anybody.

1329
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah, it's just like real priests.

1330
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,240
But by the way, all of us, excluding monkey,

1331
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,720
use irony to some extent in our work,

1332
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,680
but we all sincerely want your money.

1333
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,520
So please go into the most sincere Patreon in the world.

1334
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah.

1335
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,600
If you want to support this podcast,

1336
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,160
PAPES, go to, I think the URL is going to be

1337
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,480
patreon.com slash theprocrastinators.

1338
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,200
There'll be a link.

1339
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,760
Look out the screen.

1340
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,720
You're going to be up for this video?

1341
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,240
What?

1342
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,880
We'll be up for this video.

1343
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
It's going to be out for the last video, actually,

1344
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,840
but it's in this one too.

1345
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,880
Oh, so we're not going to pay?

1346
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,080
Can you haven't even pledged yet?

1347
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,720
Yeah, man.

1348
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,360
The payments will begin if you people pledge,

1349
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,560
which I know you will.

1350
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,720
You wouldn't betray me like that, fam, would you?

1351
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,520
Would you, fam?

1352
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,720
You wouldn't get on Ben's bad side like that, would you?

1353
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,440
Shut up!

1354
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,200
You're on my bad side, dad!

1355
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,480
Fucking bitch!

1356
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,160
Now, if you're thinking folks at home,

1357
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,240
if you're thinking, I can't afford to pledge

1358
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,760
the procrastinators Patreon,

1359
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,920
all you have to do is unsub from BenSaint

1360
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,600
and put that money into the PCP.

1361
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

1362
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,160
We have been championing patreon.com slash BenSaint

1363
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,880
for too long.

1364
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,000
It's time to take our cut.

1365
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,040
It's had a rebar reward for propagating the stuff.

1366
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,920
Pay what he owe.

1367
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,840
That's exactly right.

1368
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,920
Now, as we round the one hour mark on my record here,

1369
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,080
let's just talk about how much Seinfeld is the best ever.

1370
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,160
Seinfeld is really good, and it's the best ever.

1371
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,960
There we go.

1372
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,280
Am I wrong in thinking that...

1373
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,560
Well, you should definitely watch it, dude.

1374
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,760
It's great, even now.

1375
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,240
Am I wrong in thinking...

1376
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,000
Should I start at act five or not?

1377
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,360
You don't even know, because there actually is people like that

1378
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,960
for fucking like season four,

1379
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,080
because that's when the show picks up.

1380
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,160
Watch from the beginning.

1381
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,800
Yeah, there is a tiny bit of continuity,

1382
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,520
and it's all great.

1383
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,960
So there's like no reason to skip it.

1384
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,800
There is a lot of continuity.

1385
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,360
Actually, I've been rewatching it on like fucking like kissanime.com.

1386
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,480
I go to put locker.

1387
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,520
I wasn't put locker.

1388
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,800
Fuck yeah.

1389
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,480
Am I wrong, guys, in thinking that Lethal Aurora Mage,

1390
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,320
or Mage, as you might know her,

1391
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,920
did she learn English from Seinfeld?

1392
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,520
I can't remember who was that or something else.

1393
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,360
No, she's from anime or cartoons.

1394
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,760
Somebody else I know learned English from Seinfeld.

1395
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,640
That's...

1396
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,280
I can't remember me.

1397
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,800
I'm gonna be best friends with that person.

1398
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,240
Post in the comments if you learned English from Seinfeld.

1399
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,560
A straw poll.

1400
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,480
Did we learn English?

1401
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,440
Press one.

1402
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,760
At all, not from Seinfeld.

1403
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,880
Yeah, press one.

1404
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,600
Press one.

1405
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,520
A straw poll.

1406
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,000
Are Jesse's Donald Trump tweets funny,

1407
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,280
because Nate doesn't get them.

1408
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,080
No, no, no.

1409
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,560
I stand with it involved in my hilarious...

1410
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,360
My groundbreaking Trump tweets.

1411
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,480
Nate just doesn't get it.

1412
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,440
He's a little baby.

1413
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,840
I would say that it is true.

1414
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,200
My complaint with them is that I do not find them funny,

1415
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,800
and I find them annoying.

1416
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,120
Nate, do we have any Twitter questions today?

1417
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,360
No, no, I have one more point about Seinfeld.

1418
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,640
From the age I was like one until I was like 10 or 12,

1419
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,160
that was literally the only TV show I watched.

1420
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,840
That's not a joke.

1421
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,040
You didn't watch Will and Grace?

1422
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,480
I thought that, you know...

1423
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,960
I actually watched a bit of The Golden Girls,

1424
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,320
but other than that, just Seinfeld.

1425
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,040
Wow, amazing.

1426
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,600
Is that because your family is big Christ fags?

1427
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,640
No, it's because they're really big Jew fags.

1428
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,480
They only let you watch Jewish, right?

1429
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,680
Jew fags, right, okay, okay.

1430
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,320
I feel like we completely got off the topic,

1431
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,200
and so shall we just go to questions now?

1432
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,480
There's a shit topic, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1433
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,440
Yeah, let's go to...

1434
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,640
No, I thought the topic was good.

1435
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,520
I liked it.

1436
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,160
Me too.

1437
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,440
I'm saying that with all sincerity.

1438
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah, the final final opportunity.

1439
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,680
Anybody got any last points to make on sincerity,

1440
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,840
irony, any of that shit?

1441
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,760
I think if you use it as a crutch,

1442
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,800
you should just kill yourself.

1443
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,400
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

1444
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,840
Yeah, that makes sense.

1445
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,400
Good.

1446
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,040
Yeah.

1447
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
Okay, all right, I got questions here.

1448
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,280
Now remember, everybody, go to Twitter,

1449
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,120
follow at TPCrastinators,

1450
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,440
and send us fucking questions throughout the week.

1451
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,600
And when we record these on Saturday,

1452
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,520
I always fucking tweet to send us questions,

1453
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,480
and then we're gonna answer them here.

1454
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,240
Well, we're sorry that these past two episodes

1455
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,520
have been really, really bad.

1456
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,280
I think it's because I've been on both,

1457
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,600
and I'm leaving the PCP.

1458
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,480
It's basically like this.

1459
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,040
Okay.

1460
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,520
So it's been a send off episode.

1461
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,560
Hey, while we're plugging stuff,

1462
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,000
can we talk about the Wiki

1463
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,760
that everybody should go check out?

1464
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,440
We did mention it, but feel free to mention it again.

1465
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,200
I don't know what the website's called,

1466
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,400
but go check out the Wiki.

1467
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,400
It's procrastopedia.mirahees.com,

1468
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,040
I want to say.

1469
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,560
There'll be a link in the description.

1470
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
I added it to the description for the last one,

1471
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,000
and it'll be there from now on.

1472
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,120
But yeah, everybody, go add to the Procrastopedia,

1473
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,240
the PCP Wiki.

1474
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,280
We got fucking shit.

1475
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,200
We need troops to go in and add meaningful lore

1476
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,720
to the various pages I just made,

1477
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,320
the Action Giraffe page today.

1478
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,520
We need to add more to it.

1479
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,840
I made the illustrious Undertale 5.8.7 page,

1480
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,680
and it's beautiful.

1481
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,960
Is the Wiki gonna have cliff notes

1482
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,040
of episodes of the podcast?

1483
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah.

1484
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,080
You can link to all the information that you provide.

1485
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,840
I don't think I've seen links of what specific episodes

1486
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,040
are about, but that could be a section

1487
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,000
somebody could add, certainly.

1488
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It could be whatever we want to add to it,

1489
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,040
or whatever people want to add to it.

1490
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,160
I think they should add links to the references,

1491
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,480
otherwise it's too much of an in-joke.

1492
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,480
Nobody's really going to get it coming from the outside.

1493
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,160
I guess.

1494
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,600
I like that feeling that you need to jump in and ride

1495
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,680
for a while before you understand what's going on.

1496
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,680
Yeah, but if we keep talking about a joke

1497
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,160
and somebody wants to go see what the fuck that joke means,

1498
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,680
and then the Wiki page for it is a bunch of more in-jokes,

1499
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,280
they're not going to learn a damn thing.

1500
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,600
If we have a list of the memes and in-jokes,

1501
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,360
and then a link to whether it originated.

1502
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:09,920
Right.

1503
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,480
It should work like TV tropes, where there'll be a thing

1504
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,840
and it'll be like, oh, Undertailer,

1505
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,720
I don't know what the fuck that is.

1506
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,320
Oh, I go to his page, and now I know all the lore.

1507
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:16,720
There you go.

1508
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,040
That makes sense to me.

1509
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,800
And appearances, they can watch the episode

1510
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,480
if they want to know where the fuck he came from,

1511
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,200
any of that shit.

1512
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,080
Yeah, that's a cool idea.

1513
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,720
Well, my backstory is very long and complicated.

1514
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,080
Let's try this in the Unteller 5H7 podcast.

1515
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,400
I was a wee boy, and get the fuck out of here.

1516
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,920
Get out, stop recording raps.

1517
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,680
This is my house.

1518
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,160
Get out.

1519
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,040
OK, what are the questions, Nate?

1520
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,680
OK, here we go.

1521
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,840
We got some decent questions here.

1522
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,680
So here's the first question by Atalexus.

1523
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,680
There's a lot of A's and S's here.

1524
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,680
But Atalexus says, should we feel bad

1525
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,440
if we ask terrible questions?

1526
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:53,920
Yes.

1527
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,760
Yes, buddy boy.

1528
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,120
And there's a second part in parentheses that says,

1529
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,360
and if yes, what can we do to fix it?

1530
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,840
So here's the person asking constructive questions.

1531
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,560
I would say ask more specific ones

1532
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
that let us answer with more,

1533
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,640
like put a little thought into what you're going to hear

1534
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,440
when you ask your question.

1535
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,040
If you ask like, what do you guys think about

1536
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,800
fucking Undertale?

1537
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,680
But that's a whole.

1538
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,680
Well, let me tell you what I think.

1539
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,960
Let's shut up Undertale.

1540
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,120
We made a whole podcast about Undertale.

1541
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,760
It was the first one.

1542
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,040
Yes, there's definitely enough Undertale-centric

1543
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,560
media from us to ask for fucking lifetime.

1544
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,360
There's not enough.

1545
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,640
That would never be enough.

1546
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,720
Are you aware, Jesse, that it's become a thing

1547
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,040
where we're now just referring to video games

1548
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,000
are Undertales?

1549
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,840
Dude, I played the best Undertale today.

1550
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,800
It was so fucking good.

1551
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,240
It was like this fucking first, first shooter.

1552
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,960
Well, that's the meme that everyone can be on board with.

1553
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,520
That's right.

1554
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,080
That's right.

1555
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,200
It's like how in the South they call all pop and soda,

1556
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,320
they call it all Coke.

1557
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,160
They call it exactly like that.

1558
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,720
Go out there and play some Undertales today, guys.

1559
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,800
Undertale Five Ground Zeroes.

1560
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,160
Okay, and here's another question by at Joseph Ingman.

1561
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,840
At T.B. Crasonators, what's the coolest fight

1562
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,960
you've ever been in?

1563
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,800
So I know we're all men of the streets.

1564
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,920
We're getting a lot of brawls,

1565
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,080
but this guy's asking for the coolest fight.

1566
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,440
When I wrestled a penguin on top of an ice cream.

1567
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,880
Oh boy, he took it that direction.

1568
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,440
Of course I would.

1569
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,160
Have you ever thrown down with anybody, monkey?

1570
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah, the best fight I've ever had

1571
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,320
was in the the procrastinator's discord

1572
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,760
where I was fighting with Jess

1573
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,440
about whether or not he has an ego.

1574
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,640
That was pretty good.

1575
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,960
Oh boy, that was a legendary brawl.

1576
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
Yeah, I said that he didn't, and he asserted that he did.

1577
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
That was just you being a dumb guy.

1578
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,880
Is that what you call it?

1579
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,320
When you punch him out in the street,

1580
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,040
that's not a fight.

1581
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,560
That's him being a dead guy.

1582
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,680
Exactly.

1583
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,360
Because he's dead, because you killed him.

1584
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,960
I've never just been in a fight.

1585
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,000
I've only been in, there's a dead guy next to me now.

1586
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,240
That's great.

1587
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,760
He just did dead at me.

1588
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,480
I often beat up my friends as a sign of love,

1589
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,440
and that's not a joke.

1590
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,680
It's a mutual wrestling, like we do often.

1591
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,880
You might have heard, it's called gay sex.

1592
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,960
Is that what you do to establish dominance over the group?

1593
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,320
Yes, that's what Ben and Diddy do.

1594
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,440
Yeah.

1595
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,920
Wait, wait, wait, Ben, you've had sex with Diddy?

1596
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,880
Oh, you know, you should ask Ben when he comes on.

1597
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,320
You know, he's not here this episode,

1598
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,840
but maybe next time we'll be here to answer that.

1599
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,960
Everybody, watch this animation about Ben and Diddy being gay.

1600
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,040
The point is that I definitely don't have an ego.

1601
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,080
Anyone who thinks that either is misunderstanding me,

1602
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,640
or misunderstanding what is meant by ego,

1603
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,120
and is a complete retard who should not exist

1604
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,440
and should kill themselves, the end.

1605
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,960
What's the name of that animation you made

1606
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,560
of Diddy and Ben being gay?

1607
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:55,840
I'm gay.

1608
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,040
It's called I'm gay.

1609
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,840
It's on the Give and Take channel.

1610
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,200
Yeah.

1611
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,840
Wait, what was this?

1612
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,720
What video is it?

1613
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,680
Oh, okay, I remember now.

1614
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,720
The plot of gun.

1615
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,720
Yeah, the best animation I've ever made.

1616
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,040
It's the video I've ever made about you, retard.

1617
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,160
I remember, I remember.

1618
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,840
Okay, here's another question.

1619
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,400
Okay, at Kinkuck, I think it's Kinkuck.

1620
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,840
I don't know, it's all K's.

1621
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,840
Is that Kinkrat's cousin, Kinkuck?

1622
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,680
Basically, yeah.

1623
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,440
Okay, I'm speaking of Kinkrat.

1624
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,760
Go check out his PCP Wiki page.

1625
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,320
It's really good.

1626
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,600
That's true.

1627
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,080
That's true.

1628
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,480
Made by, I don't know, Mysterious Forces.

1629
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,280
Mysterious Forces came together to make that Wiki page,

1630
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,320
and it's glorious, and all the information on there is true,

1631
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,400
and has sources to prove what it says.

1632
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,640
Yep, the mysterious Rhino editing

1633
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,560
everyone's Wiki page in secret.

1634
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,320
I learned something new about just every day.

1635
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,760
God, who is he?

1636
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,520
Who is that fucking Rhino?

1637
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,120
No one will ever, that's the new mystery.

1638
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,520
Now that we've solved the mystery of the PCP guy,

1639
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,840
the next mystery is who the fuck is that Rhino?

1640
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,160
We read farther in that manga,

1641
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,440
there's actually a Rhino in there,

1642
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,960
wearing a mask and a fedora.

1643
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,720
Can we do a memes that need to die part two?

1644
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,120
Oh my god, dude, what if there was a video where,

1645
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,280
I mean, Colt Corona, I know he's real,

1646
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,200
but what if he was wearing a horse mask,

1647
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,640
and he took off the mask and underneath it

1648
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,000
was the mysterious Rhinoster?

1649
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,920
Oh my god, no!

1650
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,640
It's my nightmare.

1651
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,800
If that would be a nightmare.

1652
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
And actually, the next question I was about to read,

1653
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,320
Kink Cuck asked,

1654
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,720
what will happen now that the origin of the PCP guy

1655
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,040
has been rediscovered, or has been discovered,

1656
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,720
now mysterious Rhino is their new mascot.

1657
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,480
He's a new mystery guy, there you go.

1658
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,560
The mysterious Rhino is our new mascot.

1659
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,480
We put him in the corner of our thumbnails

1660
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,800
and instantly all of our subscribers leave.

1661
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,760
We have patrons in the negatives, we owe people money.

1662
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,800
Oh, I wish you could pledge negative amounts to patrons.

1663
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,160
Hey, but why do I want to know right now,

1664
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
you fucking hacks?

1665
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,080
Has he been on the side of the screen the whole time?

1666
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,720
Yeah.

1667
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,920
Oh my god, I don't know.

1668
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,800
Oh, get out of here!

1669
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,240
Get out of here, mysterious man!

1670
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,680
I don't know what you're giving me out,

1671
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,280
dude, get the fuck out of here.

1672
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,720
Wait, wait, okay, so why do I want to know

1673
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,160
from you fucking hacks?

1674
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,640
Jess, tell Colt Corona my question.

1675
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,280
When are you just going to invite the fucking Rhino on?

1676
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,760
To the animal cast?

1677
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,720
For an animal cast?

1678
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,680
That's a good question.

1679
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,040
Well, maybe on animal cast.

1680
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,880
I just don't want him on like a people cast

1681
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,240
among civilized folk.

1682
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,280
He's uncontrollable.

1683
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,640
He doesn't belong in society.

1684
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,880
He tried to integrate into society once.

1685
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,560
He had a whole thriving business.

1686
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,680
He was a gynecologist.

1687
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,280
They called him Rhino the gyno.

1688
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,400
It was a whole big thing.

1689
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,760
He got fucking disbarred.

1690
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,640
He lost his license to practice medicine

1691
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,040
because he kept molesting and raping with his horn.

1692
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,360
And it was just a whole, whole big thing.

1693
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,400
So that didn't pan out.

1694
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,760
He was homeless for a long time.

1695
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,680
You know, I found him on the streets.

1696
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,800
I offered him a job.

1697
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,560
I helped him out a little bit.

1698
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,880
And he's been, he owes me a life debt now.

1699
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,480
He won't leave me alone.

1700
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,840
I just want him to go away.

1701
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,680
But he thinks he owes me something,

1702
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,760
even though I'm a white man

1703
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,920
and he considers all of us evil satans

1704
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,520
who deserve to die for some reason.

1705
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,960
He's still, and he's fucking, you know,

1706
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,440
and the last time I heard from him,

1707
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,960
he, you know, he got a gun

1708
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,400
and he went into like a town square

1709
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,680
and he started shooting people.

1710
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
And they never caught him.

1711
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,200
So I don't know.

1712
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,200
I don't know, man.

1713
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
Maybe he's back home in Africa.

1714
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,560
Ray belongs.

1715
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,080
I long for the day he returns.

1716
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,000
He never does.

1717
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,720
Here's another question.

1718
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,560
This is, this is more of a challenge than anything,

1719
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,080
but I, I find it interesting.

1720
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,920
So at Cephirzer asks,

1721
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,800
Hey Tbc, can each one of you

1722
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,520
say something good about your fans

1723
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,440
other than giving you money?

1724
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,560
That's a tough one, dude.

1725
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,760
That is a tough one.

1726
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,320
I can.

1727
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,680
I like all my friends.

1728
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,440
I mean fans, which I don't have.

1729
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,720
But I was confused in sentence.

1730
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,200
Fuck you.

1731
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,920
I don't like them.

1732
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,240
They're mine.

1733
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:54,880
I don't like them anymore.

1734
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,440
So you like them.

1735
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:55,680
Okay.

1736
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,240
You like them.

1737
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,120
All right.

1738
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,760
Well, I guess generally I feel like

1739
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,280
the comments I get on my videos

1740
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,360
are less terrible than comments

1741
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,280
that any of you other people get.

1742
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,480
So I guess they're good commenters in general.

1743
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,720
If I could be sincere as I always am

1744
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,760
and never anything else,

1745
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,800
the best parts of probably my life,

1746
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,600
the last few months have been when

1747
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,960
somebody has read my book

1748
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,960
and they'll send me like a really in-depth,

1749
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,360
several paragraph long analysis of it

1750
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,040
or just telling me how they liked it.

1751
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,240
So that sort of thing like really gets to me

1752
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,720
and I really enjoy that if that answers the question.

1753
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,120
That I think does.

1754
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,320
That's a nice thing.

1755
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,000
Jesse, say something nice.

1756
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,120
You know, I got one actually.

1757
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,600
Maybe you'll, I guess what Mumki said is also true.

1758
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,400
Occasionally, once in a blue moon,

1759
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,680
I'll get like a really long thoughtful comment

1760
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,240
on like a video of mine that says like,

1761
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,560
oh, this touched me in a special way

1762
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,880
and here's why you resonate with me

1763
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,360
and I like you a lot and blah, blah, blah.

1764
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,920
And those feel okay, I guess.

1765
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,200
I don't know if they're worth it.

1766
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,280
You know what it is?

1767
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,360
If they're worth the rest of the fucking shit show.

1768
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,720
But you know what the best thing is about any commenter

1769
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,800
is when they're actually sincere in that comment.

1770
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
That's, yeah, so it's sincerity.

1771
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,040
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1772
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,560
The fucking code, there we go.

1773
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,880
Like how much do you enjoy when they're like,

1774
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,520
lol, you such a fag, headless Jess, lol,

1775
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,760
I speak your language, dude, get it?

1776
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,720
You're a culture fag.

1777
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,320
I don't enjoy that, Nate.

1778
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
I don't, I don't think I enjoy that very much.

1779
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,760
The irony is very destructive

1780
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,000
and anything that's not sincere,

1781
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,520
I just banned from the comment section

1782
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,400
because I'm a big man.

1783
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,080
Yes, exactly.

1784
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,240
Monkey's trying to be ironic,

1785
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,520
he's trying to have a goof on me,

1786
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,680
but I'm completely sincere in that sentiment.

1787
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,600
I am a big man and I will ban you

1788
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,680
for being anything less than sincere.

1789
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,160
Fuck you all, I take back anything nice I say

1790
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,560
about any of my fans ever, you're bad and die.

1791
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,680
Can Jess's new title be officially big man?

1792
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,080
Hashtag big man.

1793
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,360
And I just like to say that I think the only nice thing

1794
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,160
I can say about any of my viewers

1795
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,680
is if you're watching my content,

1796
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,280
you obviously have great taste,

1797
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,480
so there you go, there's your compliment.

1798
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,360
Press 1 if you're a fan of Munchy.

1799
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,000
One, fan of Munchy.

1800
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,840
Press 2 if Jessie should shit himself.

1801
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,640
Fuck!

1802
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,480
Ah locals, fuck you, do this to me!

1803
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,160
Fuck you, do this to me!

1804
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,760
I'd like to point out that Munchy

1805
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,520
has literally pissed on stream

1806
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,520
And is number one and Jesse every time shits himself and is number two now. So there you go

1807
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,400
We got number one number two. We uh, there's no other than the basic b-box

1808
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,080
Is that is that vomit or is that I mean what is what is number three?

1809
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:59,240
I think it should come because I want to make hippo come. I don't discriminate against women who can't come women should be

1810
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
able to produce number three, right?

1811
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,880
Any more questions nader, can I just

1812
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,840
For you, buddies everybody press three for us all the twiddle or clits

1813
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,400
Is that mage wait, did you just say that's mage? No, that's what you said. That's your clitoris talking to you right in the night

1814
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:42,720
If an Asian girl is masturbating is that beans and rice? Yes. Yes, it is in our sideways vagina

1815
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
So she has to reach over to the side

1816
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,400
I am your clitoris I control your brain stemmed out to go have what protected sex with strangers

1817
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,400
I didn't make taxpayers pay for your abortion

1818
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,480
Wait, is that Bernie Sanders as everyone's clit?

1819
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,920
Bernie Sanders is on Eric's clit

1820
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:12,040
As Bernie Sanders as a clit at deceived eel asks, what do you think of these fans that worship everything that you do?

1821
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,960
I hate them. I don't I don't get that myself. I don't really I know well

1822
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:22,640
I guess it's better than it's better than not worshiping everything. I do I suppose but neither is preferable

1823
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,600
Yeah, I think if you I mean people say they worship everything you do

1824
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,440
But they're probably normal in that they enjoy

1825
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,000
Stuff and sometimes they don't enjoy it, but they just want you to know that they are a fan

1826
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,440
Yeah, you know what I take it back. It's good and everyone should do that. I forget what I said before

1827
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,040
It's good. Everyone should like everything I do

1828
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:51,000
I agree unless I don't like it because then it's objectively bad because I'm the author and I have the final say on it

1829
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:56,400
Well, let me tell you I get a little peeved at these guys who say they love everything and then don't give me money on

1830
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,720
