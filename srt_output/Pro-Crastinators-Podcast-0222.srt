00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Here we are

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,800
in the desert drought land of the dark YouTube arc. And I'm here by my lonesome. Let me tell

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,680
you a story. Let me tell you a little story, okay? So I woke up today, wasn't feeling very good.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,320
I like hurt my back again. I had like a second spot where I thought I might have hurt my back

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,120
yesterday. So I rolled out of bed. I use the term roll loosely because I can't really move that much

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,560
at all. But I rolled out of bed, came downstairs, started a 3D print. Have I mentioned on The Pro

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,160
Crastinators Podcast I got a 3D printer? I think so. I started a 3D print, been dialing in some

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,080
settings, making some cool shit, which you'll see in the few months I suppose maybe. And that was,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,360
I went out, I got some some snacks, came back, checked on the print, it was doing okay. And I

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,440
rolled into discord and it's like, huh, wonder how many people showed up for the PCP today?

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm like a half an hour late. Let's see. Zero. It hadn't started. Nobody even remembered to

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,800
fucking start it. So I messaged everybody and I was like, Hey, what's going on the PCP? And I had

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,280
to check the calendar. I'm like, it's Sunday, right? This is recording day. Hmm, strange.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,800
I guess Ben is hungover, like ridiculously, according to Gib. So that's probably why he

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,280
didn't add everybody as he is one to do. And so here we are recording a little bit later than

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,280
usual. It's just me. I don't know what I'm going to say because I didn't plan on being on the episode

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,960
today, but the show must go on quite literally because this is a show. So Gib might be dropping

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,760
in at some point because I added everybody and he was the only one who responded. But we're just

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,880
going to do a chill episode today about something haven't figured it out yet. We'll get there though.

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,840
We'll get there, my friends. This is going to be a super chill laid back one man episode of the

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,200
procrastinators podcast. I guess we'll just start at the 3d printing stuff. 3d printing is pretty

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,480
fucking cool. It's been my new obsession. I talked about this on my Patreon bonus podcast,

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,920
but I've been taking a two week hiatus from the internet. I just got off of Twitter for the most

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,320
part, haven't really been going on YouTube, didn't go on any social media stuff and I haven't been

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,560
thinking about my work and my content in terms of like trying to make it good for social media

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,800
engagements. I have instead retreated and I'm trying to cleanse my brain of all that outside

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,800
influence of trying to like stress about fitting your creativity peg into the square hole of like

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
making things to satisfy the algorithms instead. I'm just like, I'm just going to do what I want.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
And it opened up so many new possibilities. My brain's going in a million different directions.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, 3d printing is fucking based and cool and sick. I've been doing all these really cool

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,920
things. I've been making 3d models and blender and I'm scaling them down to little miniature

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,160
size and printing them out and dialing in the settings of the 3d printer trying to figure out

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,000
how to make it work to anybody who doesn't know how what a 3d printer is and how it works.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There are two kinds of 3d printers. There is an FDM style printer, which is the most common one.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,400
And that's where you have like a nozzle that melts plastic to like a couple like a like 200 degrees

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,800
centigrade and then layer by layer. It goes up the entire model and recreates it in a physical

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,600
space. And that's the kind of printer I have right now. I have the anycubic i3 mega s. Maybe

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
I'll put a link to a picture of it in the show notes. If I'm smart, I will have done that.

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
So this is the printer I've been messing around with right now. And it's just really

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,960
interesting technology and how it works. It's printing at like one tenth of a millimeter

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,600
layer heights and it stacks up a bunch of them and makes figures. And I've been experimenting with

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,080
that seeing how that works. There's also another kind of printer called SLA or resin style printer.

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,040
And that's it uses like a vat of resin and then uses UV light to harden it like one layer at a

44
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,880
time. And those print even thinner and they make even better style of models. And those are good

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,520
for miniatures. But resin is like toxic and you breathe it and it'll fucking kill you. So you

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,360
have to wear like a respirator and wear gloves and shit. So that's on the list because that'll make

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,560
miniatures even cooler because that's pretty much exactly my use case. It's they make all their money

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
by selling to nerds who play D&D and want to print their own miniatures. But I'm gonna make my own

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,080
custom miniatures. So someday when I'm not gay, I'll have that. I think someone joined the call.

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:41,440
Who's here? Who joined? Hello. It's Gib. What's up, dude? Nothing much. I'm just on the procrastinators

51
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,040
podcast suddenly. Yeah, we procrastinated pretty hard starting this week's episode.

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,080
Yeah. I mean, a lot of the time it's been who's like, Hey guys, just just you know, I'm the only

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,720
one paying attention. I will announce that it's time to do PCP. But I think Ben is

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,640
indisposed in some fashion, you know, maybe a little bit of a alcohol related absence.

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Hilarious. What what a what a what a good boy he is with his alcohol.

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah, I was just kind of killing time just talking about what I've been personally doing. I was

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,120
talking about how I took a two week break from social media and it's like reinvigorated my

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,440
brain and then you realize that making things just because like you want to is fucking cool.

59
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
Because like I was talking about this on my bonus podcast that like

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,040
my entire adult life has been spent trying to make a career on the internet like since I was 16

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,120
to right now. So like 16 years. And by just taking a break and just like purposely saying just do

62
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
whatever you want to do and like stop worrying about like how is it going to be marketable or

63
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,880
how's it going to work on social media like my brain just exploded. And I started thinking about

64
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,000
like learning how to do soldering and like buying like a raspberry pi and like soldering enough and

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
3d printing like cases around them so you can like make custom little micro consoles and stuff and

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,920
like soldering together like controllers so you can make little bar top arcade cabinets out of them

67
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,720
and like just all these crazy ideas that don't make any sense to like the kind of identity and

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,920
sort of things that I've been doing online because they're not really that marketable in terms of

69
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,520
being able to produce something like that at scale or things like that but they're fucking cool

70
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
and I'm just thinking about doing cool things and it's pretty liberating because like the first

71
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,360
time I've ever really done that in a million billion years. Yeah I really like all of that

72
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,520
the sort of inventiveness you have when you just like the idea of building a tiny little

73
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,360
console is like really cool I would never think to do anything like that. Right it's very interesting

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,440
just because like a lot of the times I'll try and I want to learn something new right because even

75
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,840
the stuff I'm doing right now like learning 3d and like trying to get better at it I always feel

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,040
the pressure of I don't have time to get better I need to make things I need to output things and

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
when you stop having to worry about social media it's like I have all the time in the world I can

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,000
do whatever the fuck I want I don't have to output shit I can just learn the thing I can learn things

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,560
that don't even matter I just do whatever the fuck I want it's cool it's fucking cool. Yeah I've

80
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,800
been feeling well the opposite of that that that urge to like constantly be producing

81
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,720
ever since ever since I announced I would do the Tezuka manga project I've been thinking

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,400
gotta stay on track gotta be focused gotta be working on that uh deadline deadline oh shit

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
the world is gonna end when I get one tweet who says uh you didn't finish that and that'll be me

84
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,640
like time to get the rope guys it's time to find a tree somewhere end it all no because

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,600
there's one tweet who said I didn't do it you gotta make a tire swing that's what you're doing right

86
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,760
that's what you're talking about making a tire swing just hanging out yes that's what I'm thinking of

87
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,600
and it's so I'm like you know I've realized in the past few weeks that I'm stupidly stressing

88
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,080
myself out over something that if I hadn't announced it I wouldn't even be worried in any way I would

89
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,080
just be working I mean I would still be worried by the fact that like you're surrounded by people who

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,000
are like collectively outputting content all the time even though individually they are taking

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,360
a while each to get their thing out but like there's always something new to watch as a viewer

92
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,040
something new to see something new to read and then you're there thinking I've got to keep up with

93
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,240
like the collective efforts of every creator on the internet and it's like it's stupid so I'm like

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,400
super stupid but I feel that all the time I feel like like when you when you and uh when you and

95
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,480
Ben I'll put comics I'm like oh I want to make a comic why haven't I done it why am I not doing it and

96
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,920
it's just like dumb dumb can't you comparing yourself even though that's like my modus operandi

97
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,600
like uh Ben's been working on the uh Sleiman punishment finale and he says it's very close

98
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,680
to being finished and I know when it's posted I'm gonna be like oh that's good like I get the

99
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,760
feeling it's gonna be incredible and everyone's gonna be like holy shit Ben whoa and I'm gonna be

100
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,040
like yeah yeah holy shit Ben you mother fuck yeah exactly it's like when new lord of ghost comes out

101
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm like oh you're fucking god damn like you were doing those like once a week and I was like

102
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,640
yeah it's unbelievable turned into a magikar disgusting kill him kill him and seep his power

103
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:42,320
a vampiric ability soul drain that's what I need yeah it was I mean it was deceptively quick

104
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,640
what I was putting out I mean I was drawing the panels uh pretty fast uh but the first few weeks

105
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,160
I was like hurting my hand I had to slow down a bit but um the preparation for that had been going

106
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,560
on for months before like planning it out and and drawing all this the sketches and figuring out

107
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,960
panel lay on stuff so like actually doing the the the work of inking it was the only thing I was

108
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,440
actually doing and it made it seem like I was like a god suddenly and I felt like a god and so as

109
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,840
soon as I was like all right it's time to work on a new project because there's a special contest

110
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,960
that I want to enter um I had sort of forgotten maybe that the lord of ghost took months of prep

111
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,800
work and now I was expecting myself to do the entire thing in three months and it took two

112
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,600
months to get the story and I have one month left to draw the entire thing from scratch

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,000
and it's very daunting but I I have an announcement to make regarding that um

114
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,720
um for just you know just to make it a fun little thing um and so that I'm not like

115
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,560
suffering in silence in the darkness I'm going to be live streaming my attempt at drawing the

116
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,800
whole thing in a month over on my twitch uh in august I'm going to be doing like like a full

117
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,640
work day maybe a little less I can't remember the hours I was thinking of doing but I'm going to be

118
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,880
waking up eating breakfast and then streaming until like 7 30 pm me drawing the thing

119
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,760
and that that's going to be like every weekday of august I'm going to try and do that

120
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
and you're going to do like a regular stream or you're going to do like a silent stream where

121
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,280
you're just working and people can watch but you're not talking to chat or anything or you're

122
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,880
going to do full distraction stream where you're going to be trying to be entertaining on top of

123
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,000
being productive you know I I probably will try to be I'm going to have my mic on because

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,880
I do like interacting with the chat a little bit um if only if only to if only to like I don't know

125
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,880
express my frustration with whatever I'm doing like oh no and then people in chat can be like

126
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,320
don't worry and then I'll be like okay so yeah you actually react like that I can only hope that you

127
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,320
do ah gee you know I don't know I in my head I'm like there's no way I can actually do it uh that

128
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,960
quickly but at least I could make a bunch of content about it at least maybe you know people

129
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,600
will be interested in seeing the process maybe I could save the video and then you know when I'm a

130
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,520
super famous man and I have like a blu-ray of my new anime that I made this can be like footage

131
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,880
like commentary track I can commentate over my drawing of the original comic that started it all

132
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,200
or something stupid like that so it's it's that's that's august is going to be that for me

133
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,320
so it's like is this is this tesga comic is this like the start of a new comic that regardless of

134
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
how it performs in the tesga contest you're going to keep working with the characters and stuff or

135
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
is this kind of just a one-off thing um it it started off it was one of the characters I had

136
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,080
plans for a comic anyway so I was thinking you know if I want to make a comic about this character

137
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,960
now is a very good time to start because it's it's uh you know you gotta make a comic and submit it

138
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,080
so yes I'm gonna uh regardless of whether I finish it or not I'm going to continue to work on it

139
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,360
until it is finished and then make another chapter later and it's hopefully gonna be really cool

it's pretty dope that's that's an original character do not steal right there yep put

158
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
put that in lord of ghosts you know I easily could lord of ghosts is just full of like cool

159
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,760
character designs in the background is lord of ghosts is done are you still gonna keep working

160
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,400
on them I cut it off at a point where it could be done if I wanted it to be but I do want to finish

161
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,680
like lord of ghosts coming back with his army of the dead and being like I'll take over the endless

162
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,640
war and kill it forever so there's some sort of plan but I don't I haven't actually written it yet

163
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,280
that would be cool be sick oh god I almost I have this giant can of golden bear light

164
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,280
lemonade and I almost knocked it off the table onto my computer that would have been bad I'm

165
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,400
gonna move that away from there oh dear um shit I'm so unprepared in terms of things I wanted to

166
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,680
talk about because I was not planning on being on today I was just gonna I was gonna let Ben

167
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,720
take the reins as he is one to do but holy shit we gotta we gotta come up with something we gotta

168
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,520
we gotta pull something ever it's only been 17 minutes 17 minutes is not long enough for a

169
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,880
procrastinator's podcast episode well I uh I can I can pad this out for a little bit

170
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:53,920
all right you have 45 minutes to go okay let me go very slow um recently uh geowizard

171
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,680
youtuber and cool bloke um the guy who did the mission across wiles I don't know if you if you

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,720
watch that uh was the um the the mission to walk across the country of wiles in a completely

173
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,880
straight line using a gps tracker and uh I talked about him on the podcast before and he has since

174
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,200
then done a couple another a couple missions similar to that but not exactly the same but

175
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:31,120
recently he did uh an attempt a second attempt at this this challenge and it was a it was really

176
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,440
good I really love his his videos it's it's just something like tv quality about the the production

177
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,320
not in not in a sense of like high fidelity um footage but sort of it's a really really

178
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,960
interesting concept with you know well structured storytelling beats and editing that just sort

179
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,960
of make it flow really nicely and he's very funny and it's really just very interesting

180
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,240
and that sort of stuff just really gets me going really gets me inspired I know how you

181
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,800
earlier you were saying like when you're not thinking about like being a content machine and

182
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,640
doing stuff for social media and you just let yourself do stuff even if it's not going to be

183
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,560
profitable necessarily it's just like what do you want to do I want to do that I have no like

184
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,880
real outdoorsy experience I've gone on a couple walks and a hike maybe I've camped a couple times

185
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,200
but that sort of thing is like it's just so cool like I I went on after watching uh the

186
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,600
latest episode and I was just like looking at google earth google maps and just scrolling around like

187
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,640
what part of england could I just walk across could I just walk all the way to the fucking sea

188
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,680
from my house how long would that take would I need to pack lunch probably it's like ah the world is

189
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,360
so big and there's so much cool shit even in even in the tiniest of of country is the tiniest of

190
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,200
islands there's just so much to see human beings are so infinitesimally small in the grand scale of

191
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:14,880
even the smallest part of the earth it's just so so big guys I love geology I love geography I love

192
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,240
all of that and I'm like yeah I want to do it but then I keep thinking oh yeah COVID

193
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,320
time to just crumple into a into a I don't know this is like the perfect time to do it

194
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,400
though because then you can just do it nobody will bother you you know you can just go like like

195
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,680
no one's gonna like chase you out of a place you're not supposed to be because they're all

196
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,200
locked inside you can just like this is the perfect time to like life hack and take like

197
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,080
weird areas and go to places you shouldn't go because there'll be less people around to keep

198
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,880
you out of that I suppose that's true yeah I'm thinking of like I don't know getting a backpack

199
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,880
together I mean it's August so it would be a very like if it was a hot day it would be a devastating

200
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,680
sort of time to do this because you'd need a lot more water with you and I don't really know how

201
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,480
to live off the land or start a campfire on my own I mean you need a lighter and wood

202
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,400
so that's not too difficult it's gotta gotta learn just gotta teach yourself all I gotta learn I gotta

203
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:25,760
do I gotta go I think first step is like learning from like going on a hiking club like a finding

204
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,160
a hiking group to go hiking with and seeing seeing how fun that is just you know doing doing it the

205
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,120
baby way before I like try to tackle the wilderness with nothing but my wits because I don't have any

206
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm looking at the the wits tank and it's empty sure I mean I think that's a good

207
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,960
good mentality for learning any new skill is always start with like the least possible

208
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,720
resistance and then build yourself up because like so many times I'm going a little bit more

209
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,680
macro with this but I think it applies to really any new skill or any new hobby anybody gets into

210
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,520
you'll be a new person doesn't know anything about x subject and you'll go look online or

211
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,040
like go join a group or ask people or like research things out like how do I get started in this

212
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,880
and then they'll recommend something like two steps above like the very basic thing because

213
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
like it's the best thing to do it'll last you the longest it's the best value or whatever it's like

214
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,760
the best thing to do and then you'll do that but you risk like losing incentive because

215
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,560
it's a little bit above your pay grade because you're talking to enthusiasts you're talking to

216
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,200
people who have more knowledge so they can look at something that's a little bit more complicated

217
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,600
than a beginner level and be like this is a way better thing to get or way better place to start

218
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,240
or way better thing to like wet your teeth on but you'll like pull that back and be like I'm super

219
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
baby mode I probably shouldn't do that and then those same enthusiasts will kind of like give you

220
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,080
for it because I'm just thinking in terms of like when I started doing game dev like everyone said

221
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
you know like use Godot or use Unity or whatever and I use construct 3 instead and it's like not

222
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,120
real programming and they're like why are you using that it's like shitty and it's like not as good

223
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,280
as these things it's like yeah but I don't know what the fuck I'm doing I've told myself for 15

224
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,480
years I can't do this so like I need those little like small baby step wins to give me the the

225
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,040
confidence to keep going because if you just dive into the deep end or just like you know

226
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,520
like an enthusiast grade thing or you know put it bring it back to your example if like you just

227
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
went out in the wilderness like with a couple youtube videos under your belt telling you like

228
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,920
your best practices that's way different than like starting something really really simple just

229
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,960
kind of like ease yourself into it it was the same thing with 3d printing like there was like a

230
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,080
really like you know get a ender three kit and put it together and like then spend another

231
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,920
hundred dollars in upgrades and like pull it apart and put it back together and I got like

232
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,760
i3 mega which was already preassembled and had all those upgrades pretty much already installed

233
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,120
and it's like yeah I don't understand how the whole thing works like you would putting a kit

234
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,640
together but like I'm printing and making things and that's getting me much more invested in like

235
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,520
continuing the hobby as opposed to failing at putting this together or like getting frustrated

236
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,160
trying to figure out what all the upgrades meant and what they did and just getting pissed off so

237
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,320
like I don't know for anything you get into always like go at like the super beginner level if you

238
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,640
don't have any confidence with it even if that's not like the best way or the correct way to do

239
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,120
things that like people more into it would tell you to do yeah that such a thing that I've encountered

240
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,240
a lot is just the frustration of of people who are who are already know knowledgeable about a

241
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,960
certain subject or I mean specifically in art there are certain people who you know they drew

242
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,040
when they were very young and so they naturally gain some skills that they sort of take for granted

243
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,400
some sort of observational skills some understanding fundamental understanding that they don't even

244
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,760
know they have above like somebody who starts drawing at 23 or something um and when they

245
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,320
try to give advice they're taking advantage of not taking vultures that they're taking for granted

246
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,560
all of this stuff that they they sort of inherently understand and they assume other people inherently

247
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,720
understand it as well and they sort of just they don't know how to give the advice well

248
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,160
and then the person who is like not as not as like naturally into it or hadn't started at a young

249
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,440
enough age just doesn't understand these things that they're saying and doesn't know why it doesn't

250
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,240
working that's why that's why a really good teacher is important it's it's very difficult to get a

251
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,760
thorough proper understanding of anything from just youtube videos you need someone who knows

252
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,720
how to do the the entire teaching method stuff yeah I was about to say the exact same thing that

253
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,400
like this really like hammers home why a good teacher is so important because a great teacher

254
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
will be able to explain what they'll have the skills to do it at a high level

255
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,960
but the ability to describe it at a complete beginner level to like de-abstract a lot of the

256
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,320
kind of like essential building blocks that you don't think about as somebody new to it

257
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,960
but be able to then build upon those and give you that complex understanding over time

258
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,560
and there are some people on youtube and just teachers in general who are really good at that

259
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:41,200
and some that aren't and I think it's really easy to get into something and get a bad teacher

260
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,320
and assume you're too dumb for it where it's that the information wasn't given to you in a way

261
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
that works because not only do you need someone who can explain in a simple way

262
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,280
everybody also has like specific ways of learning things um because there's like programming and

263
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,360
stuff there are certain programming courses and books and videos that'll explain a subject that I

264
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,240
don't understand but then another person can explain that same thing and then it makes sense so

265
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,080
it's really weird like learning a new skill is very very finicky and you have to like be

266
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,920
patient with yourself to find the right teacher and find your learning style and find someone

267
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,440
where those two kind of paths collide and you can actually absorb the knowledge yeah you gotta

268
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,080
you gotta spread yourself out try try what is the word something the market you gotta you gotta

269
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,800
test the waters with all different like a variety of people because um in like if you if you went

270
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,520
to a class uh the teacher if you don't get what they're saying you can put your hand up and say

271
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:53,200
what ha like they can understand that you need help in this specific explanation but in a youtube

272
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,440
video you can't really do that you can like ask comments but like a lot of the time you find a

273
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,200
youtube tutorial and it's very old or like they just don't check the comments after a certain point

274
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,920
and it sort of feels like you can't really get into contact with the people because usually the

275
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,360
best most popular channels they obviously get thousands of comments all the time it's like

276
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
you're gonna get it's like having one teacher with a thousand students in the class you're

277
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,680
never gonna get his attention so if you don't understand what he's saying you're fucked

278
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,760
exactly so i don't know like i mean when you when you get to that point a lot of time you'll just

279
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,960
be like instead of raising your hand being like huh what you just have to like keep pressing back

280
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,360
like five seconds watch the same thing and just saying huh what getting more and more angry each

281
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:49,360
time until you feel like an idiot yeah i tried i tried a bit of programming but it was too i i

282
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,000
tried to like make this is the thing that frustrated me the most out of anything in my life

283
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,560
when i was trying to make my website which at the time was called aps adventures and uh

284
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,440
is now gib and take dot site where i just host my comics and i know what i wanted it to look like

285
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,880
i know what i wanted it to be functionally useful for and i didn't really care about it

286
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,400
being extremely technically marvelous i just wanted it to work but there's so much to learn

287
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:27,280
about the very basics of html and and coding a website that it was like so daunting all i wanted

288
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,360
to do is just say i just want a website how do i just get one how do i just have one right do i go

289
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:42,000
to uh what's that thing the thing that has been in every video um this video by square space um

290
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,600
like that i was looking at i was like hmm i get the feeling this is too expensive i don't really

291
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,240
you know i guess i'm being a cheapskate in that like i needed an easier way i needed an easier

292
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,080
way and i was like i'd rather learn it myself but it was so painful to learn i just sort of didn't

293
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,600
have the right mind for it like a lot of the things that they were saying would just not go into

294
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,000
my head right and it was very difficult to try and find a very baby explanation like a of these

295
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,600
concepts and i still to this day don't really know how my site works and if i ever need to edit

296
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,880
anything it's it's very scary and i i often i think on many occasions i've gone to discord and twitter

297
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,880
and just like cried like star web design sucks just like crying into the void like nobody understands

298
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:45,680
you know slip my wrists but with um with a you know hgtb slash colon slash slash my wrist that's

299
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:53,360
what i was going for yeah well i think it's one of the things that i do a lot which kind of falls

300
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,600
into the same sort of category is like you'll go right online uh and be like okay i want to make

301
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,760
a website and then everyone will be like oh just learn html just learn html and css bro like just

302
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,040
do it and then javascript just learn javascript too and it's just like you have to ask yourself

303
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,600
what do i actually need to know right because like if you're trying to become a web designer

304
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,280
yeah learn html learn css learn javascript learn all that shit like there's so many different

305
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,880
fucking like tech stacks for web design now it's insane i know because my sister is like a professional

306
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,920
like web and ux designer and she's like yeah i do like seven jobs now it's ridiculous so like

307
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,760
that's a whole nightmare in and of itself but like if you're just making give and take that site

308
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,480
do you need to learn html like that seems like almost like a waste of time right when there are

309
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,320
so many tools to just do it for you it's like why do i not just use something that does it for me

310
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,120
i don't you have no interest in web design outside of hosting the content you care about in a public

311
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,440
space and my personal thing is like so many times like when i want to get into something i want to

312
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,800
like learn it all so it's like i want to learn all of html just to make a website for a zoomie

313
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,200
someday it's like but why why would i do that you know i did that for sources loss i spent like

314
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,440
months building an entire website from scratch and it's like cool but what was the point like i

315
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,040
didn't need to do that i could have just gone and done what you did and just like use a website

316
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,240
builder or something and it would have been just as fine so it's just like i don't know there was

317
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:36,160
this interesting thing that um uh uh uh six tin uh uh showed me uh because we talk in uh a discord

318
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:43,120
group and stuff and it was like the valve t-pose skill set mentality thing i forget exactly what

319
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:51,200
it was called but um i guess it was like a graphic from valve and it was like you have like a character

320
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,160
standing in a t-pose and the idea was like the spine is like your central skill and the spine

321
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,240
supports that skill and that's like your specialty that's like your one skill you're really good with

322
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,680
and then the arms support skills that you're familiar with but don't have a lot of knowledge in

323
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,760
and i thought that was a really smart way of thinking about like laying out your skill set

324
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,840
right it's like you have one thing you focus on like this is my identity this is what i am if

325
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,000
i was going to have a job title this would be it the like supporting like structural center skill

326
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,960
then i have other things branching off of that that aren't nearly as strong that i should have other

327
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,400
people help or do for me or outsource in some fashion but i have a working knowledge of and can

328
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,080
support the main skill and i thought that was a really good way of kind of reeling in at least

329
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,440
my personal kind of like desire of wanting to be like a one-man band and just be the autodidact

330
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,160
who absorbs everything and learns all the things and becomes a master of everything which is literally

331
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:58,160
impossible in one human lifetime um it was fucking cool and i like that idea yeah god i i've always

332
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,640
been like skill hopping i never stick with any one thing for too long i've i've become

333
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,840
what's the term jack of all trades yeah so like it's always been a thing i do to like

334
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,360
get somewhat proficient in a skill but then find that i would rather also have other skills on top

335
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,400
of that and i never stick with anyone long enough to like become a master at it so i'm like pretty

336
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,880
good at a lot of things i'm knowledgeable about programming like i watch my brother do it and

337
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,960
he is like very very good at it so but i can i can i have enough knowledge to comprehend what he's

338
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,880
doing and maybe suggest things that don't like aren't stupid but a lot of the you know i would

339
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,040
never be able to do anything on the level of what he does uh programming wise and it just sort of

340
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
it frustrates me that i do this like i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty adept at the drawing stuff

341
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,560
i'm pretty good at animation i've dabbled in music when am i gonna be like really good at

342
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,680
anything though that's what i want to know yeah i feel the same way i skill hop all the time and

343
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,080
it's like it's not even it's subconscious because like i got the 3d printer to be like i'm just

344
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,040
gonna try 3d printing some of my models and then i got like really into that and just like like

345
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,880
researching how they work and everything and modifications and like all the different kinds

346
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,760
i'm like this is unnecessary and then from there i started printing out like little miniature

347
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,480
stuff because that was like the scale of models i wanted to make and then related videos on youtube

348
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,000
were like how to paint d&d minis and i started watching that i'm like oh it should be super cool

349
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,760
if i could like paint minis and learn how to like get the proper paints and mix the washes and all

350
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,480
the stuff and i'm just like this is completely irrelevant this is this is not anywhere on my

351
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,560
t-pose of skills why am i spending like hours and days on end researching like the proper like

352
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,600
kinds of of acrylic based miniatures paints and like i'm doing a comparison of like starter

353
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,320
kits that cost like 40 a pop i don't need to know any of this none of this is relevant go back and

354
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:11,120
learn more 3d you idiot yeah well what's wrong with us what are what are we gonna do how do you

355
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,080
ever like see an artist on youtube or on twitter or whatever that's just like does their one thing

356
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:25,680
and has been doing it for like 10 years how how'd they do that how how do people have the focus

357
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:36,240
to just be like i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this forever i i mean i really don't know

358
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,520
it feels it feels i don't want to say it gets boring doing you know a thing i like

359
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,320
because that sort of implies that i will abandon it but i never really abandon anything i always

360
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,680
come back around to it over after a few years or months when i you know whatever the time period

361
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,720
is that i'm like i've you know i stopped doing crochet for a while and then i got back into it

362
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,920
and you know i stopped again it's just sort of like a skill that i hobby like i'm a hobby

363
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,200
habit i i collect hobbies and and grinding away at a single skill i feel like most people who

364
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,000
get extremely good at one thing don't make the conscious decision to grind away at that as a

365
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,960
skill they just do it because they like doing it all the time and for me the thing that i like doing

366
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,520
all the time is not it's not usually like a skill that i can make money off of or like an artistic

367
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:41,040
thing it's it's thinking about i don't know video game analysis and watching video game analysis

368
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:50,960
videos and and thinking about stuff stuff that isn't i mean i don't know i guess there's a

369
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,600
number of things that i do unconsciously all the time that i don't really have a way to turn into

370
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,120
something profitable but other people they they do the thing that they can turn into something

371
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:11,200
profitable all the time they just love doing it and i i envy that to an extent yeah i definitely

372
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,840
envy the focus because like the things that i do i i have like a complicated starting point right

373
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,600
of like i want to like make an animation or i want to make a comic or something and that requires

374
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,640
multiple skills already because you can't you know you have an artist who just draws like

375
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,640
i'm just going to draw furries and that's just what i do i just draw furries that's what i've

376
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,840
been doing since you know 2005 i'm really good at it i take commissions and i just everybody

377
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,440
knows exactly what my my mo is and i just do that i'm like because i want to tell stories with my art

378
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,320
like just by default it's like well now you're gonna do writing layout you know like there's so

379
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,240
many more skills involved so like right from the get-go it's like a multi-discipline goal but then

380
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,440
like as you learn more about those things all of those skills like branch off into other areas

381
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,000
and i just find myself subconsciously like asking myself questions like what if i did this or what

382
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,120
if i could do that and it just the my brain just kind of naturally hops from one connected point

383
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,400
to the next and all of a sudden i'm like knee deep and like learning how like different brands of

384
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,800
washes affect the paints on a dungeon and dragons miniature or a warhammer mini i'm like why am i here

385
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,160
how did i get here why is this my thing why do i have like a hundred dollars worth of like

386
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,320
mini paints in my amazon watch list right now like what is going on i just i just want to sit here

387
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:43,120
and focus on my one thing but i feel like i have at the same time like adhd and like hyper focus

388
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,320
at the same time where like all my attention jumps all the time but like in between jumps it's like

389
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,920
hyper fixated on that one thing before it jumps to the next thing become hyper fixated and uh

390
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,880
it's like antithetical to being productive yeah it's it's it's like you know in in a world where

391
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,240
time is not an issue and you can go on forever you will eventually it's like you're you're working

392
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,320
on you're leveling up many different skills uh one of uh you know like alternating which

393
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,080
skills you're leveling up rather than going full on strength or full on you know intelligence or

394
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:27,360
whatever you know dark souls or whatever so like you're you're you're spreading them out and eventually

395
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:34,720
they will all be maxed out but most human lives end before and most dark souls play chess and

396
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,240
sessions end before you've gotten to the point where you have enough xp to max out everything

397
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,640
so you will be constantly halfway there on everything and never at 100 on any one thing

398
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,600
and other people i don't know whether it's like right to say that other people just think differently

399
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:59,840
because i um i i get the sense that it's it's more of a uh it's like

400
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,920
no i can't i'm trying to think of the way to explain it it's like i think about drawing

401
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,320
and i draw and then i you know i get into the comic thing and i'm like okay i need to figure out

402
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:21,440
how to write the story i look into writing things and now i'm i'm going on websites and blogs that

403
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,880
are talking about writing for novels for books for short stories and i'm thinking maybe i could

404
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,000
write a book as well or add you know instead or afterwards or something like the knowledge you get

405
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,720
sort of takes you off in a different direction right it like opens up a new possibility for you

406
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,160
like you're thinking about writing for comics and someone's writing for novels like oh yeah i could

407
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,200
do that like i could do that and then like that seed is planted and it's like well if i was going

408
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,720
to write a book what would it be and then like all of a sudden that's now another thing in your

409
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,000
brain and it's just like well i'm gonna have to deal with that rattling around in the old gray

410
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,240
matter for the rest of my goddamn life now yeah and i'm like i'm wondering for the people who

411
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,440
don't branch off like that is it that they don't consider it or is it that they are just merely

412
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,400
uninterested in doing something different or is it like discipline is there someone who's just like

413
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,880
they have all those things in their brains and they're just like no fuck you this is the right thing to

414
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,560
do i mean i i suppose it could it could be any one of those things i'm thinking of like someone

415
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:33,040
like uh steven king for example he writes so much all the time so many books feasibly could you

416
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,000
imagine steven king getting into a different creative thing i mean you know if he just did it

417
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,920
one day he's like oh now he's a painter yeah that you could see it happening because creative people

418
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:54,000
they they do creative things but i get the feeling that it's not like he would i just couldn't imagine

419
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,920
him like deviating so completely from the thing he has done for so many years do you think i'm thinking

420
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,400
like is is it like i can't imagine how much discipline you would need to see all of these

421
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,840
creative things you could be doing and just say no every single time i feel like do you think in the

422
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,840
case of like someone like steven king it's because he's older and like didn't have the internet like

423
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,720
i'm sure like back in the day he was not you know there was no youtube for him to go look for writing

424
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,960
advice on he probably just like maybe he just started writing or maybe he got a book you know

425
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,120
that was just about that one thing that didn't have thumbnails and and the fucking related tab

426
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,040
on every page attempting him to go to other things just like this is what i'm gonna do

427
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,640
and it's a simpler time there's less distractions i've made up my mind

428
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,520
and like the path i go down to learn this does not have all these branching avenues that the

429
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,400
internet gives us now yeah i definitely think that could be part of it can you think of someone who's

430
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,560
young who who acts very focused on one thing i just i just think like commission artists and stuff

431
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,560
or like the first like really simple example they just like settle in their style and they just

432
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,720
they're just happy drawing like you know characters just character portraits and character

433
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,960
illustrations i'm like never really going to do in comics never really go into anything else

434
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,280
like that it's just like i'm going to draw this character i'm gonna draw this character i'm gonna

435
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,760
draw this character and um i don't know and then you have people who just animate they're just

436
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,240
they're just i mean i guess animation is like multi multi-discipline so maybe that's like

437
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,600
once you get into animation you feel like you're switching gears all the time and it kind of

438
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,320
yeah is interesting in and of itself but even then like i've done animation and like even while

439
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,000
animating it's like well then what if you made it a video game you know which is how like the

440
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,600
video game stuff started was like it started with animation then it pivoted into that because like

441
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,200
that was just the next step was like layering another skill on top of what was already there

442
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,760
and um i don't know i guess at some point it's like i started drawing as a little kid

443
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,680
and then it went to comics and then comics went to animation then animation went to games

444
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,840
it was just like layering new skills on top of each other before like the the last was even like

445
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,440
kind of like out of the oven yet and like some people just stop they just stop at one level

446
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,480
of abstraction which is like i'm just gonna draw or i'm just gonna write and i don't really

447
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,720
i don't know i don't have the self-control every time i've done something i've completed a work

448
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:31,120
it's like very much like because there was like a conscious uh active self-control going on to not

449
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:40,720
like go off into the weeds i wonder like if part of that is like not that the people who focus on

450
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,280
one thing sort of only get to level one or like only find one skill and then stick with it forever

451
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,840
i'm sure many people try a bunch of skills and then they find the one that they like the most

452
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,920
and they stay with that but also what happens is they sort of leave the other skills behind

453
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,400
because like with you um all of these things the the drawing the the animating the 3d modeling

454
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,480
and the game development like they they build on each other but you feel like you since you

455
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,520
have been doing all of these things potentially could do all of these different things for the

456
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,240
video game you could be the animator and you know all you know all all of the aspects of video game

457
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,040
creation that you've learned you would you would keep using all of those skills even though it's

458
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,240
very difficult to be a one-man army and make an entire thing uh with all of the the skills

459
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,720
that are required of it which is why most games are made with a team even a small one right right

460
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:50,800
so it's like if i if i wanted to make i don't know fucking i i i always have this idea for

461
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,000
animated music videos when i really listen to a song i'm thinking you know very very classic

462
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:04,000
like everybody knows this feeling and i'm like okay well i can draw i can animate a bit wouldn't

463
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
be cool if i did the drawing and the animation and and the you know all of all the things and

464
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,480
maybe even the music i mean usually i'm listening to music so i'm not thinking about that but

465
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:25,280
in in like a real life like sensible setting i would instead like be like commissioning a

466
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,840
team of animators to make the thing that i have the vision for i would direct it i wouldn't do

467
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:38,400
all of the work right god imagine imagine being able to have a team that just did stuff for you

468
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,280
oh oh the joy the joy of like all the ideas finally escaping my brain and just being out in the world

469
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,120
yeah and then you look at it and you're like i don't know this key frame here is not how i

470
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:57,600
would have seen it in my mind's eye it's like a little bit of uh scrap it burn it all it's not

471
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,520
in my perfect vision i should delete the channel start over move over entire animation team i will

472
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:10,960
do all of the work and then i try and i fail it's the feelings that that feeling of it not

473
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,000
oh get out of here professional programming team i'm going to program my game with elif

474
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,360
is that threads for is that why i i feel i thought i don't know much about that guy but i feel like

475
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,080
isn't it like more of a scam that he's playing like he says he's working on it but he really isn't

476
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,680
well there was one point taking the money i mean i'm sure i'm sure that's what he's doing now but

477
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:45,360
there was one point where like a company tiny build like worked with him he like he hire i don't

478
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,960
know if he hired them but like they decided to like help him make the game and they had a programmer

479
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,920
come in to like rewrite all of his code because it was a nightmare and he got mad that he couldn't

480
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,360
like work on the code himself anymore because this guy was coding way better than he was so he

481
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,440
fired the entire publisher developer and went back making it by himself

482
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,480
lol like he was so close to being free like it would have been out it could have been done by now

483
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,280
but i don't know because of that hubris he was like nah nah i got this and now we're like what three

484
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:29,040
years later and it still barely has progressed at all like why would he do that is it really like

485
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,960
i'm like not i've barely looked into this so i don't know if i'm like being stupid but like

486
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:42,960
from what small things i've heard he would have like i feel like he did that maybe to get away

487
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,200
with it taking an extremely long time and taking the money that's the the vibe i get from maybe

488
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,360
how people talk about him i mean at this point like everyone just convinced it's a scam

489
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:59,520
but i this was a few years ago when like people thought it was a scam it's super strange right

490
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,480
like if he had a team who could have finished it then he would have had a video game that you

491
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,320
could profit off of anyway like right i just i don't know it's so strange but i like i'm always

492
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,440
afraid of becoming that you know just like being so blinded by my own hubris that even even in the

493
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:26,000
face of like a team willing to help me i'm like no good to do it all myself like uh uh never go

494
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:37,680
full yandere dev i i feel like i could uh what i want in in like the the near future is for me to

495
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,520
make some of these comics and for you know my drawing skill to improve over time be like pretty good

496
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,600
and you know it'd be like something i could sell on on the on the store shelves or whatever i could

497
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:56,400
be like a brand leo malley almost uh who's you know he's got a very distinct cartoony style

498
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,360
that's very appealing and he's good at making this stuff but he's not like he's not like the biggest

499
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,880
like draw god of all time like the scott pilgrim increased in drawing quality as he went

500
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:16,320
and so he was definitely like improving it you know still so like as i get to a decent enough

501
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:24,000
point i can start and then i can get better as i go and then the big ideas i have for like

502
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,040
dude what if there's a video game of like punk and and stuff i could i then i would have like

503
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,560
money to to pay people to do that yeah yeah you want to just like get the ball rolling

504
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,360
and like start a franchise so people will want to work on the franchise you have the

505
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,200
money to pay people to work on the franchise and make it bigger and then there's snowballs

506
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,520
and you're like all right the momentum's going without me slaving away every single day to make

507
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:56,000
it happen i go to edgar right and hi all me is zaki it's a guys i want to make a comedy ghibli

508
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,160
film uh with bell with punk in it and they'll be like hell yeah it's like we get to work with give

509
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:10,000
and take literally our dream yeah oh no it's too cool i'm getting upset

510
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,040
oh god the future you know as long as i don't like throw in the towel it looks bright i have

511
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,920
i have more skill at art now than i did a few years ago when it was merely a twinkle in my eye

512
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,120
and now like the idea of making comics uh that have cool characters in them that i did and made

513
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:39,680
and i could you know it's it's it's looking like it's gonna go well the tezuka manga thing might

514
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,240
be a big old failure but i will definitely come commit to the thing i have and then finish it

515
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,760
whenever it's finished and uh there's more on the way god it's so cool the idea of the future

516
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,600
being better than right now that's what i like yeah i got like i got like three or four things in

517
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:05,520
the oven right now that i'm not talking about publicly man i'm stoked i'm stoked to see them

518
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:12,160
finished it'll be fucking cool a zoomie and the vertical slice and then a to me the vertical slice

519
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,160
to the vertical slices the vertical slices the vertical and horizontal slices slices slightly

520
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,880
to the lower left major this is smash bowl oh my god zoomie confirm the perpendicular slice yeah yeah

521
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,600
there we go somebody animate that not me though i'm too busy with other things

522
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,960
oh my god dude we kill it we made it to an hour we did it well 52 minutes but like we almost did it

523
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,400
do you think we should open up the speak pipe and listen to any uh things i was gonna say we

524
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,600
should go to the speak pipe but unlike ben saying we should not play every voicemail we should play

525
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:03,040
the voicemails that seem funny because oh my god uh there's over 25 already uh uh yeah there's like

526
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,360
26 more voicemails i don't know if do you want to listen to 26 voicemails not really but i don't

527
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,920
know how to tell which ones are good and which ones aren't the short ones are the best

528
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,160
oh no okay so this we're gonna play a game we're gonna play a game okay uh this is how

529
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:31,440
the voicemail is gonna work i'm gonna pick a voicemail that i think is gonna be good if it's good

530
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,520
thank god if it's bad you can uh shit on me relentlessly then you have to pick a voicemail

531
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,320
that's higher up like a newer one than that one the next okay and then we'll just keep going back

532
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,920
and forth until we get all the way to the newest one all right all right that's that's the plan

533
00:53:53,760 --> 00:54:01,440
i'm gonna start with oh man we have to go back to the previous page i don't know if any of those

534
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:12,880
seem good those seem juicy there's six on the previous page yeah um all right i'm gonna pick

535
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,000
the fun all the way at the bottom the joker thread it's seven seconds so even if this is a

536
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,160
total bust not too much of our lives or wasted it's the last one on the first page the joker

537
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:36,880
thread not the joker the joker thread okay all right three two one go if nate doesn't upload a video

538
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:47,600
within three days i blow up a hospital um weak wait what what this was five days ago when did

539
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:56,960
nate upload the uh gets ghost in the shell uh review i thought it was more than five days ago but

540
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:06,800
maybe i'm wrong is this guy this is the joker a fucking idiot let's find out either way this

541
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:14,960
this voicemail did not age well best guy ever three days ago oh so this was pre dates that

542
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,080
the video dropped so do you think do you think nate popped into the speak pipe and uh saw that

543
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:28,240
and desperately threw together the video to save the hospital yeah it seems it seems likely

544
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,120
even though the video even though this was marked as unplayed before right now that's still definitely

545
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:42,720
what happened all right thank god for the video it came out after all these millions of years

546
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:52,000
incredible incredible 2020 is saved okay so now i have to choose one yes uh oh wait uh

547
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,440
how about smearg all right let's do smearg um one uh three two one play

548
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:11,040
hello and howdy i'll get right to the point i have an idea to present i've been listening

549
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,960
to a lot of hello internet and core text recently and on those shows they have sometimes what they

550
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,840
like to call a quote unquote book club segment i'd like to propose that as a potential segment the

551
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:32,560
pcp could have a quote unquote quote quote book club of its own you could take turns having one

552
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:39,760
of the co-hosts present one particularly interesting maybe analytical youtube video each week the other

553
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,880
co-hosts and listeners could then watch this video over the course of the week and it could

554
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,520
generate some hopefully interesting conversation for the next episode that is all thank you

555
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,000
see nice you had me you had me until you mess said youtube video because books high tier youtube

556
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,440
videos bottom tier but nate can't read so i'm glad that you included him uh books you gotta

557
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:17,600
find them and read though just go to archive videos just go to youtube.com have a let's read

558
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:27,040

pcp listeners and voicemail senders let my story be an example and testament to all of you

587
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:57,520
that you too can end up in voice jail for absolutely no reason if you just send good voicemails

588
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:05,760
just keep making good quality and you will indeed be punished for it just like society

589
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:13,920
is meant to function thank you ben yeah i mean you know when you mess with the bull society

590
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:20,160
you get the horns unfair treatment yeah that's what you this is a social commentary voicemail

591
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:27,120
service doesn't matter what you're doing you will get killed and fucked with yep there is no justice

592
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:33,200
there is no fairness there is no quality all will be crushed under the heel of our boot uh because

593
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:40,640
we can sorry well uh well i mean we didn't put you in there so that's true it's all ben's fault

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:47,520
ben's not here it's all ben's fault we go to take it up with ben saying dot com i'd say go kill ben

595
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,000
but it seems like he already killed himself yesterday and now he's busy dying yeah it takes a while

596
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:00,400
for him to to die he's very strong um i'd you know i'm sort of just drawn to the ones with the

597
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:07,360
people's names that i know there's crack here that's true coda for endless war and uh cool man

598
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,480
so let's do that all right three two one go hey ben did you see all the tweets about UFOs being

599
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,800
real it's really funny how everybody was saying space jam was real when they cancelled uh the

600
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:27,120
nba for the virus and now aliens are just real uh you're an astronomer retired space cam counselor

601
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:33,200

605
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,040

606
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:02,800
are they illegal though that's that's the question i mean technically yes right they're

607
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:08,320
definitely not citizens of any country so they would be illegal aliens shit i have to pick one

608

like gay voicemails it's the worst food it doesn't digest well none none the worst you just roll up

612
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:55,040
to the drive-through you ask for a bad voicemail thinking it's gonna be a pleasant treat it's like

613
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,960
yeah i just need to pick me up right now and then as soon as like it touches your lips you're like a

614
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:07,200
fuck oh god why did i do this i forgot i forgot and then you feel like shit forever so thanks simon

615
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:15,840
love you buddy yeah um i i actually do have an answer to this what food don't i like marzipan

616
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:22,640
and i i've never had marzipan i don't even know what it is i've heard the word marzipan is a

617
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:29,040
thick icing like um thing you put on cakes to make them look really nice you can mold like little

618
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,720
figurines out of it and it's edible obviously um huh but maybe i have had this but just not

619
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:42,000
knowing what it was but it is it it does not taste like icing which is just sugary sugar um

620
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,400
it tastes it has a very distinct taste and i absolutely hate it it is so delicious looking

621
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:55,280
because it just reminds me of like really chunky like birthday cake ice cream and it's like ah it

622
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:03,760
should be the best thing ever but it's so odd and good and bad in fact and i hate it it sucks

623
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,200
something that nice looking should not taste like that that's what that's my food that i don't like

624
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:17,120
huh i'm tempted to try it now just to just have an opinion on this contentious issue i'm looking

625
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:26,560
up pictures of it not even looks familiar i don't have cake like ever so damn uh okay do i have a

626
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:34,800
real answer to this question um cucumbers i hate cucumbers the texture offends me the taste

627
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,560
isn't that bad but it's not good either so it's just like neutral taste with unpleasant texture

628
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:49,360
mm-hmm can't don't like it it brings down every salad it's ever been in don't recommend zero out of

629
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:58,720
ten celery celery is like bad because the texture is a little bit more pleasant yeah it has a taste

630
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,880
i don't really like i don't like the taste of celery i don't avoid it it's like a weird bitterness

631
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:12,400
yeah but like i don't know by itself it's it's not it's not terrible i'd rather have like that kind

632
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:22,400
of like downward kind of bitterness of celery than like the nothing like slop that is uh cucumber

633
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,000
so yeah but neither are very good especially like a slightly

634
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,600
un-fresh cucumber that's starting to mush

635
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,960
like sometimes that the crunch is enough like it you you crunch it it's like yeah it's crunchy

636
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,520
but when it's sort of like too wet it is kind of like what is this why yeah why does this exist

637
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,040
why are you're not a pickle yet so you haven't gone to something good you're just a worse version

638
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:57,200
of what you already are all right i guess i'm choosing one do it uh

639
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:09,520
none of these all right i guess i'll just do the next one application all right three two one go

640
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:20,080
so this is my application on the uh podge podge and uh reason reasons well there's clearly a shortage

641
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:26,400
of members and i'm a perfect guy for it i think i could leave sweet new angle to the pcb with my

642
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,840
food i can't tell if this quality is like part of the bit or completely accidental

643
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:40,480
intelligent conversation yeah and uh i guess uh i guess uh jones jones is slob another

644
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:51,280
oh my god well you know if you know if i wanna uh let me on uh uh sure sure okay i'll see you then

645
01:07:51,920 --> 01:08:02,720
you're hired we have you have you you have the voice quality uh uh down pat to be on the pcp

646
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:09,440
you have our level of quality perfected yes we are we're starving for new members

647
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:15,520
seriously we need we need as many members as possible everybody should be joining the pcp

648
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:21,760
should be a new fad new craze should be should be able to if you go to patreon.com slash the

649
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:29,200
procrastinators and you become a patron you're automatically entered into the random drawing

650
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:37,920
to become a member of the pcp that will be decided uh 10 years after the last procrastinators podcast

651
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:44,160
member has died so if you want to be part of that drawing that will definitely happen be sure to

652
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,920
become a member yeah at patreon.com slash the procrastinators and you have to stay a patron

653
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,880
for that entire 10 year period even as we are slowly dying like flies every every month you're in

654
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,040
and uh your card clears is another entry into the contest so the longer you stay the more

655
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,960
chances you have i'm thinking of the implication of that is that we will all be dead in 10 years only

656
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,360
that's all the time we have doing the pcp we'll kill lucky

657
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,680
uh shit now i have to pick one don't i um hmm

658
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,360

661
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,360
newest voicemail the last one we got a mere hour ago why munchie why

662
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:55,200
all right are you ready yep three two one go i am literally shaking and crying right now pcp

663
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:04,080
i want to know i want you to tell me why munchie left the patreon lounge i gave the pcp five dollars

664
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,720
to join the discord for perhaps the honor the privilege to have maybe one or two interactions

665
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:18,880
with the legendary munchie j trump and he's gone he's nowhere to be seen why why did munchie abandon

666
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:28,640
the patreon lounge i'm i'm shaking and crying how could you do this to me uh i didn't even know

667
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,760
that happened did you when when did that happen uh i feel like he's been gone for a long time or at

668
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:40,800
least i mean he never really looks at it does he most of us no i i i check you know occasionally

669
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:48,640
seeing what's going on same same um there's just so many uh uh channels in the the procrastinators

670
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:55,120
lounge i'm just like man that's a lot that's a lot to sift through but i only check the the main one

671
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,680
i guess the off topic usually the one i check as well yeah but uh if you really want to talk to

672
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:06,720
munchie there's an easy way to do it get on a plane go to boston uh find the crazy man just

673
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:11,600
listen listen for the extremely loud foot stomps and screaming you'll find him

674
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,760
oh man but but for real if you want to talk to munchie he's probably much more reachable

675
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:27,280
uh on endless war the ratty fuckers cop killers endless war discord server with slime is true

676
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:33,040
you just go in there uh you become a paragon of the community and then maybe munchie will

677
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:38,880
pay attention to you you'll you'll have to draw a lot of slime you'll have to become slime but

678
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:46,240
you know it's worth it yeah there's always you know uh price a price involved in meeting your

679
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:51,600
idols the people you respect you know and uh you know at first slime is like icky and gross

680
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,920
and you don't want slime but you'll learn to love it you'll learn to be addicted to it uh

681
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:03,760
and you'll make the a hair gal face every time oh oh sounds sounds great sounds like a grand

682
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,840
grand old time uh seriously i haven't talked to munchie in a long time i don't know why he's

683
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:17,760
he's uh sort of minimizing internet stuff i get the the sense i haven't heard from him

684
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,640
like exactly what he is trying to do but he's like he's been doing like what i did for the last

685
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,680
two weeks like ever since he started school and uh he's probably all the more powerful for it i

686
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:37,200
can't imagine the fucking titan of of divine energy he emanates now i mean the other day um

687
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,680
he just came into one of the discords i'm in um and he was just sort of like

688
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:50,560
ratatouille like at everyone ratatouille now rat spewley right now and then like i was watching

689
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:57,440
ratatouille with him and kazi and a bunch of other people uh like five a.m so he's he's alive

690
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:04,640
he's doing stuff but he's like with you know he's not looking at twitter he's not doing

691
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,520
really any sort of discord watching looking at he's he's just watching rat spewley

692
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,120
is he making stuff or is he just kind of just vibing and enjoying life he is currently

693
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:24,320
doing a lot of coding for endless war because there's a big update coming i don't know i'm

694
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,560
you probably have no idea but they they've been a lot of big updates recently the in the the endless

695
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:40,720
war map uh has been increased in size in the in the way of like now there used to be districts you

696
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,760
would type exclamation point go to district and within those districts there are a number of

697
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:54,960
like locations like there would be a pub in some area there's a cafe there's a uh the you know the

698
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:02,000
slime labs where you can make a slimeoid various places around the city and now in those places i

699
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,720
haven't even really done it myself but now there are individual streets that you can go down within

700
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:15,040
those areas and it's like orders of magnitude more exploration you can do and it's very complicated

701
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:19,520
i've seen a few images of like the behind the scenes of like what it looks like to program

702
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,360
something like that for discord and it is there've been lots of like hurdles trying to get discord

703
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:31,920
to cooperate with such a strange thing because it's a mod that like involves hundreds of players

704
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:40,880
asking the bot for like you know you know a server is like responding to all of these requests

705
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:48,000
and then all of these different like to be in a district or a location gives you an invisible role

706
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,200
and there's only so many roles that can exist and so they've had to work around that

707
01:14:54,160 --> 01:15:00,800
oh Jesus it's like it's it's like a nightmare and i assume he's working very hard to get whatever's

708
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,200
happening are we going to get to the point where endless war is going to have to like move to its

709
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:10,080
own native application i feel like they're gonna hit the limits of discord at the rate they're

710
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:15,440
going i there's definitely been moments where that has been like on the table as a thing to

711
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:23,280
definitely think about um i'm not like in with the developer crowd discord like i i don't know

712
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:29,600
exactly what's going on but i've heard talk of like but that but also part of it being on discord

713
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,800
is the point so like yeah they would want to keep it there if they can i suppose like some of its

714
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,200
identity is very i mean like the whole pitch is like you know it's a mml you play in a discord

715
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:44,960
server so like if it's not a discord server part of its identity is lost but like i would hate to

716
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:52,560
have discord hamper the game's development and growth but interesting very interesting good to

717
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,080
hear munchies spend all that money went to art school is doing nothing but programming

718
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:06,480
lol i mean the whole thing with covid and him not being able to go to the lessons that he bought

719
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:13,680
is like so upsetting dumb dude it's like it piss like legitimately pisses me off because like we

720
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:19,040
had all those arguments and like his big reason for going to school in the first place was to

721
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:25,840
meet people and be in the like the be in the school around the people that was the entire point that

722
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,800
was his big defense was that like i'll be able to pay for it i have a way to do that but i just

723
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,600
want to be there and mingle and now like the whole reason for going to school is like invalidated

724
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:44,000
yeah and it's the teacher is teaching is a lot less useful through like zoom or whatever

725
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:51,360
and that there was like there was like i can't remember exactly what it was but it's like

726
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:58,720
a number of classes that you know they got basically ruined but he wasn't reimbursed

727
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,960
for the things that he like the pandemic ruined for him he still had to pay money

728
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:12,000
for oh no it was it was it was the student accommodation since he couldn't be in the the

729
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:20,800
campus uh he was staying with uh with kazi but the um student accommodation refunded for housing

730
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,600
they did not get refund they just still had to pay that lawsuits incoming as soon as this

731
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,480
fucking covid shit is over every school if the schools aren't refunding housing they're all

732
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,640
gonna get hit with fucking lawsuits and they deserve to get fucked in every single one of them holy

733
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:46,080
shit yeah that's ridiculous it sucks the whole thing so god the internet stinks real life stinks

734
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:52,320
what's even what's even it's even the point what's even what are we even gonna do god damn it

735
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:59,120
the final arc of humanity is a real downer that's okay i'll just i'll just draw a funny

736
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:05,920
comic about a lady with a gun she'll shoot she'll she'll say yeehaw and shoot some enemies that's

737
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,200
that's the the pitch for my comic by the way uh sick pre-ordered immediately

738
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:20,560
all right well unless you have anything you'd like to add i guess we can call this episode

739
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:28,960
a wrap uh i'll just like to reiterate that i will be streaming twitch.tv slash gib and take

740

742
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:53,280
at some difficult parts probably and that'll be that'll be going on for as long as i can

743
01:18:53,280 --> 01:19:00,160
fucking stand sick i'll probably stop by now and then see how things are going sounds pretty cool

744
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:08,560
yeah uh don't forget patreon.com slash the procrastinators if you want to support this

745
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,880
podcast uh we got what like how many bonus episodes we got now for five dollars and up

746
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:23,360
we got more than 52 i can't remember the holy shit cannot remember the exact three or more bonus

747
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,480
episodes and we just guys just recorded a new one a couple days ago right no i'm thinking of weeks

748
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:34,320
of the year how many do we actually have we have we have one bonus lie where we have one bonus

749
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,600
episode per month it's been going for a while i was on the last one let me just check what the

750
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,440
file name for that was i figure since you were on it you would have had this right there right

751
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:56,160
there ready to go no i'm stupid uh unfortunate shit uh oh no i didn't remember what the number was

752
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:01,680
so i just called it bonus episode we got a lot of bonus episodes when there's a lot of them

753
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:08,960
they're really fucking good oh we just had a new one yeah the new one was me and ben talking about

754
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:16,080
how uh we uh tits it was just me and ben talking about tits and breasts and it was really fucking

755
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:24,480
epic and it's not as crude as it sounds we got along a lot of interesting uh tangential topics

756
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:31,040
about that and it was really good you know only five dollars gets you access to an entire

757
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:37,680
discussion about titties plus tons of other episodes with similarly interesting topics

758
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:43,360
it's it's it's it just bleeds value uh you'd be a fool not to pay five dollars a month over on

759
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,800
patreon.com slash the procrastinators and if for some reason five dollars a little too bougie for you

760
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,320
all you proliterates and get in at the one dollar tier gives you access to the the patreon discord

761
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,800
minus munchie maybe we'll drag him back in someday we're all there having a good time

762
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,960
minus munchie and uh it's great it's a great time it's fun go check that out if you want to

763
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:12,080
leave voicemails uh that's speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail uh we'll listen to some of them

764
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,280
maybe someday nate will come back and curate them uh but until then it's just whatever

765
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,400
game we come up for listening to them so put your best foot forward and maybe you'll get on the show

766
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:29,600
and not end up in voice jail and uh we have twitter uh at tpcrastinators to keep you updated on the

767
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,000
state of our youtube channel if it ever will be revived forever get the videos back um

768
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,160
are we are we still trying to find all the videos i know ben was starting to get that going uh to

769
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:45,760
like kind of like see if we had backups of everything and in case we uh have to unfortunately

770
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:52,960
face that reality which seems to be ever more uh like the case because yeah they just there's nothing

771
01:21:52,960 --> 01:22:00,160
happening um yeah we're we're still emailing them so eventually doing our best but there's not much

772
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:07,200
you can do unfortunately it's fucking youtube if you go on twitter at team youtube and at the tpcrastinator

773
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:13,680
what was our twitter the procrastinators yeah at at tpcrastinators at tpcrastinators uh just let

774
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:19,600
them know that you want the channel back yeah doesn't hurt if you have backups if you have

775
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,800
backups of uh some of the videos uh let us know because we're trying i think ben is putting

776
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,240
together a spreadsheet just like where all the other videos are and what we need to get back what

777
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:34,480
we already have so uh in case we have to just re-upload everything from scratch it'll be good to

778
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:40,560
know what we do and do not have access to so that would be a huge help and uh other than that i think

779
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:55,120
we're ready to end the episode everybody thanks for listening uh goodbye goodbye
