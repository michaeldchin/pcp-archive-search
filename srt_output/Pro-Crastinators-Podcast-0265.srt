00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is an unexpected Ben cast. Gibb was around. Gibb was around today and I just assumed she'd show up, but no. No, it's the time has come. It's almost 25 minutes past the starting point and you know, I'm all alone.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I guess that liver poison I've been feeding here has been working. I finally got the dose right. And now it's all mine. I have the floor to myself. I can platform my far right, my alt-right ideas. It's finally time.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, it is episode 290 whatever, 287 whatever, and it's another fucking celebration of me and all things me.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so I don't want to talk. Well, there are some things that I don't want to go too into depth in because I actually am I owe my patrons a podcast, which I'm probably going to record tomorrow, a sort of update about me and what I've been doing and especially the game project for that.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I could talk a bunch about that, but I'm going to hold off here. I will I will vaguely say that what's been going on with me is that I've been working on that I after the after the demo came out I worked really hard and really diligently for a bit right before the demo and I got it done.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And then I was a little burnt out afterwards and since then I have been doing I have sort of been focusing on easy shit like like sprites and assets and stuff rather than digging into like the kind of nitty gritty of like the programming side of it to implement the stuff that I wanted to implement that wasn't there.

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I've been making progress but I still feel bad. I've been making very um, I don't know. I guess I could say superficial it's not really superficial progress because it is all stuff like new sprites new animations like I did want it was all stuff that I did intend for the final game to have so it's

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:00,000
not very work but the game itself is pretty much in the same state it was when the demo came out it just it looks nicer it has it has some stuff anyway that's that's what I've been up to with that but if you want to hear more about that or ask me questions about that you can go to patreon.com

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to see the famous world renowned um what else um somebody it was you know what let me let me credit them in the in the radcon for paradise discord server it was K5 Josh thank you K5 Josh for for linking this 4chan thread in

11
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:43,000
response to Nate releasing his new Kingdom Hearts 3 review um they they there is Nate discussion and then there is a lot of general PCP discussion and you know it's a lot of it's a lot of the same it's a lot of the same shit you see on Kiwi Farms it's a lot of the same

12
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:03,000
it's a lot of a lot of the T word a lot of that old transphobia but there's there's some funny stuff there's I have one or two a lot of a lot of stuff but Ben is annoying Ben's too political Ben's a fucking communist I have one or two defenders in there

13
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:19,000
not just like dick suckers either there's there's one guy in here who I really appreciate because he doesn't just say that like he doesn't say that I'm I'm great or anything he criticizes me in certain ways but ways that I agree with and then he

14
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:34,000
also he gives me credit for things that nobody's let me let me read this one this one made me really happy Ben saint ah yes the arch nemesis of forge also I have a feeling that whoever wrote this listens to the podcast so if you're hearing

15
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:51,000
this thanks and I'm sorry I'm I'm embarrassed to think about you hearing me read your fortune I'm embarrassed for myself and for you and I and I hope that it brings us closer hopefully we feel the same way about it

16
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ah yes the arch nemesis of four channels like us huh LeMau Ben politics brought the show down but he made some good points here and there editorializing by me I do think that there were times when I was too aggressive about it and and brought it up when other people I do think there were

17
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:27,000
like that I'm not I'm not free of I'm not free of blame of criticism in that area not as often as some people said I did but sometimes I did anyway much less political now people don't give him enough credit for being one of the only members to want things to be completely

18
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:42,000
transparent he was the first to say he didn't feel that mumke needed to be kicked out he called out shit on everyone just feeling attacked mumke not really contributing anything meaningful to any PCP episode he was on did you wanting to steer the show in directions no one wanted and the stupid idea of

19
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:02,000
informing a sort of RLM collective he is keeping the PCP a lot how to falling out with digi because uh the I prefer to call her Trixie I don't I don't like I'm not offended by someone calling them digi because digi is a screen name but this person said digis I'll read what they said that's whatever sorry

20
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because he doesn't respect his friends and thinks they're all fucking idiots she dude got mad when a friend of digis opted to either make a new rad con or refilm the pony lecture digis rad con lecture he doesn't want to make public as this was before

21
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:38,000
oh god oh no slur skipping it some of the other people never mind never mind I take it back I don't want to marry you anymore you need to work on yourself nevertheless thanks for thanks for thanks you for acknowledging the

22
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm all about transparency people complain about me Trixie complained about me talking about things I shouldn't talk about saying stuff that's like ooh you shouldn't talk about your friends friends that way and it's literally just I don't want to hide shit and lie about shit

23
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:13,000
that's that people have that's a problem people have with me is that I don't do that and you know what good I'm glad good good for me no apologies um I don't know there's some more here whatever it's kind of a funny thread a lot of a lot of bullshit too but some of this stuff is funny

24
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:41,000
uh whatever I no no need to go any further and you get the idea um so what else what else happened okay I I remembered the other week when we had simsian we talked about israel there was a something that I forgot to mention but that I in hindsight was like I wish I mentioned it I made some I made some pro palestine post on twitter and some that a bunch responses I got one guy

25
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I had I had a couple of people who argued with me but one guy stuck out it was this is one guy who was like what do you want to free them from and I said you know genocide displacement whatever I forget what I exact said and and this guy was like um actually the jews or I don't remember if he said the jews or israel israel whatever

26
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:30,000
he said Israel has actually given so much to Palestine you know Israel is actually the good guys and I was like what do you mean I've seen the maps I've seen how the territory and a terror palestinian territory has shrunk over the years and this guy's like no no no actually it's like this and then he goes on like a 20 I'm not even joking like a 20 post long thread paragraphs and paragraphs about how like oh in in like 1940 whatever uh palestine

27
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:51,000
refuse to sign an agreement with Israel over such and such and it's like all stuff from like the 40s 50s 60s and I'm kind of like reading along and just being like I this I'm not I'm not really convinced that this is that relevant was going on right now yeah historical context whatever the guy goes to such length that like he eventually starts

28
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:07,000
linking me to wikipedia articles about like I'm not kidding symphony orchestras and football teams that used to be like called the palestinian team or the palestinian symphony orchestra but are now called

29
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:25,000
like the Israel versions like they changed their name and were subsumed by Israel and this is supposed to be evidence that like actually Israel is giving stuff to them because they took their fucking football teams or something I didn't get it I didn't get it but my

30
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:42,000
my that was the point when I stopped I was I was actually like following along and responding in good faith but that's the point that I was like I don't think I don't think this person has any good points to make I think we're done when you're like no no this football team changed its name that's why

31
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that's why fucking we got a bomb the AP headquarters to

32
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and I thought that was pretty fucking hilarious

33
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:21,000
last week I talked at length about my horrible L the horrible L that I took on Twitter the first and worst L that I've ever suffered or ever will suffer when I tragically mistimed my tweet about Trixie give us the fucking footage and just barely missed just barely missed her

34
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
actually fucking doing it somehow

35
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
only because Riley told her to

36
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I just barely missed it and was wrong and fucked up and then they got to go haha I already I already sent it actually you nerd

37
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
big L but I gotta win I gotta win this time and I and I won't belabor the point but I have I've redeemed myself with a W a big fat W

38
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the long and short of it is that I a little while ago I found out that some of the videos on the yig channel are being edited for free by friends of theirs and these are monetized videos that make the money and promote their stuff so this is like unambiguously a for profit thing that they are using free labor to have made for them

39
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
which I I don't think is right under any circumstances

40
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:36,000
literally they are and I know this is an inflammatory way to phrase it but yig studios is literally doctor wolfing people they are literally I love Kim possible allotting people remember that if anyone if any how many of you listeners were around back in the brownie days if you were you might remember

41
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I love Kim possible a lot and doctor wolf did the same shit they would make money on videos they would publish videos that they would monetize with ads and you know charge money for on their patreon and they would get artists and stuff to do it for exposure or just because they knew them and were friends

42
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:05,000
oh we're all just friends here oh no we're all just we're all just pals right like I'm not like your I'm not your boss like we're like family you know like family share with each other like it's not big don't worry about it don't don't get money involved we don't need

43
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we're friends we're all friends here don't worry about it says says of course the one who's making the money on it says that right of course class classic tales all this time so anyway they're doing that

44
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:30,000
so they put out a video and I respond on the video I don't name any names but I say pay your editor and the editor who I won't name but I don't like them at all

45
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the editor responds with a big screed about like leave me alone stop bullying me because I said pay your editor so this all happens

46
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:00,000
a screenshot of her twitter she she winds about it on twitter whatever long story short the yig the yig people all get upset they're all Ben's a bully Ben's so mean Ben doesn't understand that we're all just friends here

47
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it's not like for money it's not it's all we're just family we're like family we're like friends we share why get money involved huh what are you communist you just don't fucking get it

48
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:36,000
long story short they said okay we'll pay the editor now get fucked get fucked losers I fucking big w I got ya I got ya assuming they're actually gonna assuming they'll they'll actually do what they say and keep their word which I don't I don't trust them too but I'm just gonna I'll just assume that they're telling the truth and it's and it's a big fucking win for me

49
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:52,000
big fuck everything's fucking coming up Ben saying I got him so if you were concerned about me last episode you I'm sure you remember how how just how the L affected me just how traumatized I was by it but don't worry

50
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm talking about the W I'm talking about the W briefly briefly bringing up the W

51
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I talked about the L I gotta give equal time to the to the W are you recording by the way I am recording yes hi Ben I'm done though I was hey give I'm done though I was I was just about to move on from it.

52
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I swear I probably I was probably on it for maybe less than 10 minutes maybe five minutes it's fine it's fine it's good how are you how are you doing.

53
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh you know I was I was sorry I'm late for the the PCP I was I was watching the new mission across Scotland you know the Geo guess our boy Geo wizard did the straight line you have told me about him.

54
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The straight line across Wales he did that and did another one there's a bunch of different like missions but this latest one across Scotland.

55
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I've been anticipating it because he's only he's only gotten more adepts and better at these is it.

56
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is it a series or is it like a big one big like movie okay.

57
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's the 30 minutes and it's part one they're usually in parts yeah so yeah yeah hi I just didn't pay attention to discord in that time.

58
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Tisk Tisk Tisk.

59
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Imagine not paying attention to discord imagine not being keyed in the social media.

60
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
God I fucking hate.

61
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know no I would never do such a thing.

62
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I got I got I got a fucking get off Twitter.

63
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know I talk I talk I talk about these this W like it's a big but it's actually an L that I'm even fucking involves I understand I know intellectually I understand that emotionally I just want to fucking.

64
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I know you gotta you gotta destroy your emotions you've got to become a complete robot and and and think of think of the facts and logic.

65
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's dumb and it doesn't make you happy and it doesn't do anything so stop.

66
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It enough but I but I but I but I got the W though but I know I just said it was an L it was a secret L no it was no it wasn't no it's not possible.

67
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're not owned then.

68
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But but if but if my W's were actually L's then then what was it all for.

69
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What if I what did I get out of it.

70
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Nothing.

71
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh no.

72
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No.

73
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In fact you got me holding holding a W in my hands that starts dissolving like the like the end of of what's the Marvel one where they all dissolve that one.

74
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It turns to dust.

75
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's like it's like Terry and Lannister said your your your W's will turn to ashes in your mouth.

76
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Here's the W that matters is this image.

77
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Wait, I gotta see.

78
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I gotta I gotta fucking see the general.

79
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's in general.

80
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm in general.

81
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Jump to present.

82
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh yeah.

83
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That one.

84
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah man.

85
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I know I'm.

86
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I feel like.

87
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Is it is it a hipster opinion is it like some hipster smug douche baggery to say like that's when Homestuck was still good.

88
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The first time you see Rosalind.

89
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah like this well I mean maybe not that but like I think this might be the peak of a series for me or like when Rose enters when Rose enters the like the period when like all the kids are entering the game.

90
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's that's peak Homestuck for me it's better than the troll stuff.

91
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I like the troll stuff fine.

92
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But like all the time when all the four kids are entering the game is like.

93
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That definitely feels the big the big hype.

94
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What's it what's it called suburban countdown was what's the.

95
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do do do do do do do do do.

96
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
S.

97
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What is it?

98
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
God what is it?

99
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Which one?

100
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Which one?

101
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The one you were singing.

102
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I forget what it was called.

103
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
When Rose breaks the bottle.

104
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah she breaks the bottle.

105
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That one's fighting the big ogres all over his house.

106
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And Dave is doing stuff to get Rose in the game.

107
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I love all that that is really really cool shit.

108
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's the synchronicity of all of these different things happening at the same time.

109
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait is it called S synchronize?

110
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No no I feel that's I feel like there is a no there is a there is an S unite synchronize where Jake and Dirk.

111
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And everyone they all get together.

112
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's like two flashes punctuated in the middle with a decapitation.

113
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah as great and as great and epic and cool and whoa as a S cascade was and it is I think I like the old I like these ones better.

114
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I really like the ones that are all hussy art the ones that are early on when you're still sort of like finding out and I mean you find out new stuff in cascade.

115
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But like when you're when you're getting introduced to the world through the flashes the one the one where Rose enters the one where and and and Dave enters in the one where WV rise up when the when the the thing.

116
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean I mean like the flies across the map.

117
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Those are all like I think my favorite my favorite flash in the whole series is though is Jade enter when she shoots the pinata.

118
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think that is number one.

119
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah.

120
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's the song.

121
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

122
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's the same song I use for S mega slime to send.

123
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think I think that's the same.

124
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Was it.

125
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh yes.

126
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Right.

127
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You used visuals from S cascade but you use a different song.

128
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No you're right.

129
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

130
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That one.

131
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Like the green sun.

132
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This has become another fucking Homestuck cast.

133
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No I like that.

134
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We need more of it.

135
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's fine.

136
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The green sun getting formed out of the two universes and spoilers by the way and Rose and John and Dave going God mode like that was a pretty big twist.

137
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That was pretty like whoa but it I think for me even better was when and and it was you could see you could probably see it coming.

138
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think other people saw it coming but I was reading.

139
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Serially I was really it had all like been done before and I was reading through it really fast all in one go I didn't have to wait between updates so I didn't see it coming when Beck prototypes himself.

140
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I was like oh my God the consequences the consequences are so dire right now this is so fucked.

141
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They're fucked.

142
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And they were.

143
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And it was great.

144
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I freaked out.

145
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because you know.

146
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because you know what it means.

147
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You know what Beck is and what he can do.

148
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's like oh no.

149
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's all the stuff you've seen with John fighting like basic imps and then Rose and Dave and then they become like there's extra there's like they mutate and they're even more tough and John's like.

150
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They're tough but they're still like whatever like oh they got tentacles now.

151
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The president the president has said that they will become more powerful things are put in and then like a literal God jumps in there.

152
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

153
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

154
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think the early flashes like WV rise up and stuff those are like impactful.

155
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think mostly not mostly but in part because that sort of showing of things happening has not like.

156
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You've seen like bits of music and bits of animation but you haven't seen like a big thing putting them all together to show so much plot happening all at once.

157
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And so much of the early part of the comic is just like reading.

158
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know you're just sort of going at your own pace like you click on the next page when you're done reading.

159
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's all very much within your control and then these flashes are like they're so quick.

160
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I remember feeling like I couldn't take all of it in the first time watching like oh my God that happening and what does this mean.

161
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's so fast.

162
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The plot is so the plot is so slow and plotting and it's like so meticulous and like you know page by page only for and then in the flashes when like it all comes together and in a in a in a second it's like.

163
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh well that shit you set up boom pay off boom pay off.

164
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

165
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
All in this bait you spent like hours reading here and then and then it all pays off in like 30 fucking seconds.

166
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh God.

167
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I love Homestuck man.

168
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I just so good.

169
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't know.

170
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I wonder.

171
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't think it's cold like Internet culture has fallen out of love with it.

172
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a little bit of a scapegoat now.

173
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
People like make fun of it now.

174
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Nobody takes it seriously anymore but yeah I think so.

175
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think when people say Homestuck.

176
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't really know about it anymore.

177
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:43,000
When people say Homestuck you know it's like oh that thing before Undertale like oh that thing that everyone used to be really weird about with all the weird fans and like the troll makeup and it was like cringy.

178
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I feel like to call yourself a Homestuck fan now has a little bit of the stigma of being like a Sonic fan like it's for weirdos and it's a weird thing and it's funny.

179
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I suppose but I mean I see people say that and I just like I scoff at their existence because they're coming from a place of they're coming usually from a place of complete ignorance.

180
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like isn't that like really long?

181
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Why would I read it?

182
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Why should I ever take that sort of person seriously?

183
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's the same people are like I don't want to read one piece.

184
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I mean I heard it's the greatest thing ever but it's so many chapters.

185
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't want to do it.

186
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But people don't talk about yeah they say that about one piece but they don't say I heard it's the greatest thing ever but I don't want to read it about Homestuck.

187
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They say oh I heard it's dumb or only weirdos like it or it's embarrassing.

188
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I guess I don't hear that much of that.

189
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I hear people because I'm in communities I'm in people know about Homestuck and the people who don't hear about it and they're like you know I should read that but I got so much so long.

190
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And you know what I don't really like reading in fact and I'm stupid.

191
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Like that's sort of I don't think there's like a statement.

192
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't read the pastor sprites.

193
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't read the pastor logs.

194
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Just click through.

195
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Just look at the pictures.

196
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah yeah yeah just look at the pictures.

197
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Just get the brisker and then set it as your desktop background.

198
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So that's what you do.

199
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's how you do it.

200
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The optimal reading experience.

201
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Did I tell you that I went through Homestuck for no real reason?

202
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But I got every single instance of brisker appearing visually and I even in the flashes I like I paused it and I took screenshots and I got like every instance of brisker and I just put it in a folder.

203
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't even look at it.

204
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I just think it's funny that I did that.

205
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's that's fucked up because I've done I've done a similar thing but for a porn star for my favorite porn star.

206
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh no.

207
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That's the only person I've done something like that for.

208
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Which means like downloading their videos.

209
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean like going I mean like going through my favorite videos and like screen capping images and like saving the images out of the videos and putting them in folders.

210
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Maybe we could combine our powers and like it's nice those drawings.

211
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I could trace those screenshots and put risk in them as well instead.

212
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No thank you.

213
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's okay.

214
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You don't have to do that.

215
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Why screen grabs is this like a thing you did a long time ago?

216
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't know.

217
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's easier to look at a picture than it is to like scrub through a video.

218
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah I guess.

219
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

220
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I never thought to do that.

221
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well I mean I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying it's a normal thing to do.

222
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh God knows I want to be the most normal of all.

223
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

224
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And just that's that's when you say you did that with Friska.

225
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm like I did that but it was a little different.

226
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's that's my.

227
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What's the word?

228
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
My touchstone.

229
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's my point of reference for that kind of degenerate behavior.

230
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It wasn't degenerate.

231
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It wasn't even a sex thing.

232
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah anything homestuck if you say so.

233
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If you say so.

234
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Anything homestuck is degenerate.

235
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
No no no.

236
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I do have a porn folder of all the Friska porn that exists.

237
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That is a thing.

238
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Of course.

239
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But the homestuck.

240
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And it's the same folder and it's the same folder.

241
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No they're completely separate because one of them is drawn by Hasee and the other is.

242
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Well one of them is canon.

243
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The other one is just like if I see a pornography but it has the Friska horns.

244
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Even if I don't like it I put it in there.

245
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I don't know why because I look back at them I'm like gross.

246
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Well it's.

247
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Do you do it for is it for like I don't know like references like in case you need to refer to a Friska moment.

248
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You have like a collection of the images on hand that you can easily access.

249
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I think it literally was like wouldn't it be funny if I did that and then I could say I did that.

250
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like haha I'm insane.

251
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I like Friska this much than I did this.

252
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No.

253
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Really?

254
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It was.

255
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You were thinking like haha it would be so funny if I did this because people sure would think it was weird and quirky.

256
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
True.

257
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Unironically true.

258
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Because I already had the Friska porn folder.

259
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That was the degenerate.

260
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You did it.

261
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You did it to.

262
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Simply having every Canon.

263
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You did it to own the lips.

264
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Having every Canon like instance of Friska visually was like not as insane as the porn thing I think.

265
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Maybe.

266
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
No I think mine there's a tangible benefit to mine.

267
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No I mean mine.

268
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Like I already had the porn Friska folder.

269
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh.

270
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's safe for work like the Canon Friska folder was just sort of like the same thing again but at this time I wouldn't go to whack off about it.

271
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You know I would just look at it.

272
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I would just have it.

273
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It would just be collection I put on my wall or on my shelf.

274
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Sure.

275
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Can you hear me by the way?

276
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I can.

277
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sorry Discord was acting weird for a second.

278
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

279
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean okay.

280
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well sure.

281
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll just I'll just let you have that.

282
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You know what?

283
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You can.

284
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This is America.

285
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's a free.

286
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's a free country.

287
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Look I don't care about what people think about my folder.

288
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

289
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

290
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Well good.

291
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Because you wouldn't like it.

292
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's labeled W.

293
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you knew what I think.

294
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well what do you think?

295
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's labeled.

296
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's labeled.

297
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No no no it's fine.

298
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's labeled W because you took that W just like me.

299
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

300
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You love the W.

301
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Wait why is it called W?

302
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No it isn't.

303
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It was a joke based on you having talked about W.

304
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh I didn't get it.

305
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Ugh.

307
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,440
And then I brought up the Rose Lalonde picture and now we're talking about Homestuck and

308
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,000
we have been talking about Homestuck and then I talked about the Frisco folder.

309
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And then and and and it just goes around in circles.

310
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's a never ending story.

311
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay.

312
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think we've covered that.

313
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Are you?

314
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Now that we've thoroughly embarrassed ourselves.

315
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Absolutely.

316
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's move on to something even more embarrassing.

317
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Talk about being a soyboy cuck who got the fucking Bill Gates microchip implanted in

318
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
him.

319
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh.

320
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm chipped.

321
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm bugged.

322
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You're vexed.

323
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm vexed.

324
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Are you?

325
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You're not vexed.

326
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They don't they're like not doing them yet.

327
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I mean I think I could get them if I followed up on it.

328
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Like if I say hey can I have my thing and they're like sure but they're doing it.

329
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They're like at level 30.

330
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
They're doing 30 year olds.

331
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So it's not so long until I'm I'm going to get a text from the government saying it is

332
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
time for your thing.

333
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Time for your ball flattening.

334
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh no.

335
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The the yeah I got my second shot a couple days ago and it's like literally no symptoms.

336
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Everyone said like oh it makes you kind of sick for a little bit.

337
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It makes you feel like flu symptoms.

338
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Not me.

339
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I didn't feel a thing except it hurt a little bit for like that day because I got like a

340
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
little shot and it kind of was sore.

341
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Pretty cool.

342
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm just I'm just different.

343
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah I've always wondered like what about it.

344
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I guess in the same way that the virus affects people differently.

345
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The vaccine will affect people differently.

346
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But I don't know how I don't know how like the antibodies like just get get a clue quicker

347
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
than the other ones.

348
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It is it's really it's pretty complicated but I like I was I was getting all like antsy

349
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
about like oh no are they gonna am I gonna fucking die from the vaccine.

350
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Is it all just a fucking is it all just an op.

351
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So you know I was looking up info about how because I heard I heard people calling it

352
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
like gene therapy like it's like something that fucks with your DNA.

353
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And so that made me nervous.

354
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I was like let me let me find out the truth about that turns out no it's it's not that

355
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
they're talking about denim jeans.

356
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It makes you it's like like they put they put RNA in your body and your your fucking

357
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
cells read the RNA and it's it literally the RNA they put in is instructions you've

358
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
you've seen the pictures of the coronavirus and it's like the ball with all the spikes

359
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
coming out of it.

360
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes it's when they say when they say spike proteins what they mean is those spikes on

361
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
the outside of the fucking ball.

362
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's literally RNA that contains the instructions to make those spikes and they

363
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
fucking attach themselves to your cells and your other cells learn to kill them

364
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
basically.

365
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So what it is that makes you sick is that it's that you yeah it's that your body is

366
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
attacking the cells that have these spike proteins on them and it gives you the same

367
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
symptoms you get when you're fighting off any like illness like when you get the flu

368
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
for instance because that's your body it's your immune system killing your cells in

369
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
response to getting all into overdrive heating up and taking up water and it's like

370
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
we've got to put resources into water development we've got to make little nukes.

371
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But it's but it's your it's they do inject RNA they do inject genetic material into you

372
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
but it does not interact with like your DNA and in fact like a virus is made of

373
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
genetic material a virus is made of RNA so you would have the RNA in your body if you

374
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
got the virus anyway like those spike proteins go into your body because they're part of

375
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the fucking virus so you like you would get it's really annoying because I saw people

376
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
calling it gene therapy and saying it fucks the genes and then I found out like no it's

377
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
just it's a part of the virus that is made of RNA same as any virus you would get the

378
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
same shit in your body in your cells if you just got the virus versus if you get the

379
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
vaccine it is and it's like no it's it's totally insane it's a complete like it's just a complete

380
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
misunderstanding of what it of what a virus is a virus is literally made of genetic material

381
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
so don't fucking it was it was it was it was it was low it was low-fi Republican and it

382
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
was razor fist that I saw saying a bunch of shit about how the vaccine fucks with your

383
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
DNA I know and I hate them I fucking hate them I fucking hate razor fist so much I

384
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,000
hate I hate low-fi Republican too but in a much less personal way okay enough yeah

385
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
about them anyway what were you saying I was just saying like the way I've always thought

386
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
about it because I feel like I was told this when I was really young or it's just like

387
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the vaccine is like a tiny version of the virus that you will be protected from it's

388
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
like a practice round you get like a baby version and people just figure out how to kill

389
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
the baby and but they go around saying the vaccine contains some coronavirus people will be

390
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
even less you know reticent to take it because they're stupid I was I was told as a kid that

391
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it a vaccine contains like some dead version of the virus which is like maybe it's kind of

392
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
true yeah this one because I don't think it can take over your body the thing like is

393
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you get sick afterwards but it's not because like whatever was put into you is like multiplying

394
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and turning into a virus that you will have it is just that your body is fighting it that

395
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
it's all of the stuff that happens whenever you get sick in any way you know it's I don't

396
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
know I I almost feel like it's passe to be complaining about like anti-vax shit but I

397
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
don't know I've just been seeing a lot this week and it makes me really mad and people

398
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:37,000
say oh god oh no I had a point oh no or it disappeared people are saying anti-vax stuff

399
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:51,000
gene gene therapy oh no oh yeah people say 2% mortality rate oh it's only 2% mortality

400
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
rate it's you're probably not gonna die if you get it so why even fucking get the vaccine

401
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and like okay first of all imagine let's just take that on its face imagine it's or even

402
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
okay cuz that's like only for like older people so if you're younger than that it's let's say

403
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
it's like 0.1% okay imagine how much of a beating right a physical beating a thrashing with

404
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
with a fucking hard like crowbar you would need to be inflicted upon you to die right

405
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and then imagine instead that someone inflicts you know 0.1% of that on you are you okay no

406
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you're not okay it hurts really bad and it probably fucks you up second yeah like the

407
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
death rate is pretty low especially if you're like the death rate is low especially if you're

408
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
young especially if you don't have any like underlying pathologies that's true but like

409
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
that doesn't mean that you're just fine that doesn't mean that you get it and then afterwards

410
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you're fine and like it's the status like I think H bomber guy mentioned in the VAX video

411
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
he just put out that like one third of people like a third of people have chronic like long

412
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
term side effects like chronic long lasting like respiratory distress or you know loss of

413
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
their sense of fucking taste or whatever and like this is the fallacy right it's like oh

414
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the death rates low so I'll probably survive yeah but like you're not just okay it's not

415
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the it's not like you either die or you're perfectly fine nothing happens to you it's

416
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
some maybe you die or more likely it makes you really sick and it possibly fucks you

417
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
up for a long time that happens all the time it's really common like yeah the consequences

418
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
of it are not simply limited to the death toll even though the death toll is really bad

419
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
right like 2% death toll is actually really a lot of people when we're talking about like

420
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the entire population of the United States and Europe and other places oh my god I'm upset

421
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:07,000
yeah it is it is always a bit annoying to see like the the you know vaccines are on the

422
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
table they hurt a little bit potentially and then your immune you know pretty pretty much

423
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
unable to catch the virus at least in the current strains so it's like there's like so little

424
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
downside to taking a vaccine much in the same way there's so little downside to wear a mask

425
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
but people don't want to take even that because they just can't imagine that they would be

426
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
imperiled because they just don't they just think that they're gonna live and everyone else dies

427
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
because that's always what happens that's what's happened every day of their life is that they

428
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
continue to be alive and other people so it can't be them it could never be them it's

429
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the it's like every every living person is subject to survivorship bias because nothing

430
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
has killed them yet right yeah um yeah and I hate that I see that all the time I see that

431
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
all the time like you always assume that it's not gonna get you because nothing has got you yet

432
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because you're still alive but guess what one day something's gonna get you like it or not

433
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
um the um uh what really makes me upset what really bugs me about it is that it got to me

434
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
like the fact that it made me nervous about getting it I was infected they infected me with the

435
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
with the virus of thought right with the fear mongering it worked it fucking made me like oh

436
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
everyone else is afraid of it I should be should I be afraid oh that makes me nervous it worked

437
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm not immune to propaganda and the fact that it's so common I was seeing all over the place

438
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm like is there is there something to this is there something to all this fucking fear mongering

439
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,000
there must be or else why would so many people be repeating it it is yeah it's annoying because

440
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
like you go around life and most people don't really know things they just have heard true

441
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and believe certain bits if you go and look at like data like scientific studies about

442
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
it really anything you can get a much clearer understanding of what the actual knowledge is

443
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
sometimes you learn that it's inconclusive and that any assertions made would be hasty

444
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and then you realize that the people who like you know why would they make this assertion

445
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,000
other than other than other potential assertions oh it's their bias oh okay I I get a sense of why

446
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the discourse is the way it is and you know it just depends on a lot of factors that have

447
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
nothing to do with the real you know real like actual quantifiable information so I don't know

448
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:09,000
right does yeah I don't know I don't particularly I feel pretty confident in vaccines I have

449
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
no reason to like suddenly doubt them so whenever I heard something was like fucked up I always

450
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
think of that as like a dumb American thing because dumb Americans are known for being

451
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
dumb and I hear about dumb things did you watch the H bomber guy a vaccine video do you watch H

452
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,000
bomber guy I think I've seen a few of his videos they're okay I I didn't watch the vaccine I he's

453
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
not my I'm not like a huge H bomber guy fan or anything I think he's all right he doesn't put

454
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
out videos that often so what he put out the vaccine one and I watched it and I didn't know that

455
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
like a lot of you say it's dumb American thing but a lot of like the modern anti-vax movement

456
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
started in the UK because there was like there was literally one guy who had a fucking I don't

457
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
remember his name I recommend that video but there was one guy who had a fucking he basically

458
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
like published a fraudulent paper that said that tried to his he falsified data is that published

459
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
a fraudulent paper that tried to establish a link between not even vaccines in general just one

460
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,000
specific vaccine and autism and the reason he did it spoilers is because he then wanted to pedal

461
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
an alternative vaccine that he claimed wouldn't cause autism the whole point was just he he wasn't

462
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
even anti-vax his whole point was just don't buy that vaccine by my vaccine instead and then to do

463
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that he created this fucking huge anti-vax like cultural culture of fear that has persisted to this

464
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
day so money motivated this right capitalism all over again everything is it's always capitalism

465
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:04,000
true true this is particularly particularly insidious though well yeah but fuck I mean I say

466
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
dumb Americans I did grow up like that's like the stereotype like Americans they eat McDonald's

467
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and I have that but there is there is like a there is like a sense of like superiority in

468
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Britain that makes people think that they can't be wrong the more I learn about the more I realize

469
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
other places so yeah the more I learn about Britain the more I realize that you guys are

470
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
kind of prone to most of the same failings as we are just like in not in like it's a little bit

471
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
different flavor but of like the same fucking psychosis I don't remember where I heard this

472
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I feel like it was a documentary just on TV I was watching but it was about people like British people

473
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:03,000
saying about like like like a race relations like oh well British people are racist and of course there

474
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
is racism in England and Britain you know that it's like there's a lot of it there's a lot of it in football

475
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
like explicit racism sure yeah I know what you're talking about and there's all that sort of stuff

476
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and people normal people just assume that it isn't the case because well we're British we're good

477
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and that's sort of like a weird like sense of righteousness like yes Britain we're so great we

478
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
won World War II you know we did all of these things we had Winston Churchill no we won World War II

479
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
with our guns it's because I think that we could look at America and say ha look at them being dumb

480
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,000
in certain ways we are not like that at all and just like ignore the problems we have and it's really embarrassing

481
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,000
going now and seeing that we have fucking so much turf power so much turf power is everything

482
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
it's I don't want to be the I don't want to be the America defender but I do kind of think that like America

483
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
being how it is is a little bit of maybe a little bit of a scapegoat that like people don't notice when Britain

484
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
is bad because America is usually worse in most ways usually a lot of time a little bit of a shield hashtag

485
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:29,000
not your shields I wouldn't say that there's anything necessarily good about like trans acceptance in the US

486
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
but I feel like it would be better than the UK I would somebody somebody clip that somebody clip somebody clip

487
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Gibbs saying there's nothing good about trans acceptance say put it on me I mean you can't clip a video you'd have to

488
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
download the whole thing we're on twitch put this on twitch.tv and then clip it like the state okay anyway it's it's yeah yeah

489
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I feel like it's I don't know I would have to actually look into it I feel like there is a bit of hysteria as well it

490
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
varies from state to state like a lot of you know a lot of the red states are I see a lot of like headlines that are like

491
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:16,000
you know like I don't know Alabama or Tennessee is like passing a resolution to like you know force businesses to put up

492
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:24,000
fucking warning notices that like they let trans people use their bathroom of choice or whatever it's correct me

493
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:34,000
correct me if I'm wrong but like I don't I don't isn't that I don't understand that like what's the has a has a

494
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
business not is a business not by default just like allowed to let any whoever they want use whatever bathrooms they want is

495
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that not like a yeah that is everyone is just allowed to decide for themselves I think I didn't look into this too much I did see

496
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it on Twitter a bit I think what it is and the reason is bad is that it requires I mean I know why it's bad it requires people to

497
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
put in their establishment we accept trans people so that cis people you know bigots can look at that and avoid them oh oh I

498
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
don't want trans I don't want to be in the same place as a trans person let's get out of here you know scamper away like freaks and

499
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:29,000
and that is sort of but like I don't know I couldn't so fucked that's so fucked yeah even like imagine if like imagine

500
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
if they said even if it wasn't trans people even if it was just like you had to put up a notice that's like I don't

501
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't know we fucking let anything we fucking let any kind of warning we let X kind of person use our bathrooms it really

502
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:59,000
really just like because they can't make it so that you're allowed to discriminate against people based on their gender identity like

503
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
they can't make a law about that so this is the next best thing for it for like being bigoted and allowing that to happen is

504
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:15,000
so they're literally saying like people to avoid them this is this is literally like oh my god this is this is the fucking free speech

505
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:24,000
people they must love it because this is literally saying businesses you were allowed to just let whoever use your bathrooms you want but

506
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:35,000
we would like to pass a law that will punish you you must you must now either not let anyone we don't think you should be letting

507
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:47,000
use your bathrooms or you have to put up these notices letting people know what freaks you are or something I just a little fucked

508
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that's such a weird fucking thing all I want to do is diarrhea with all the girls I just want to go in diarrhea with all the girls

509
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
that just is what I want to do people bad about diarrhea where I would like to do it people talk about the bathroom thing like it's

510
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:13,000
some kind I don't think there's any like law that says that like public places have to have like a bathroom that only you know biological

511
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
men can use and a bathroom the only biological women like I don't think that's a law that's just sort of a convention that that places have

512
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
started doing maybe some places it's a lot I don't know but it's not it's it's not some kind of like incontrovertible fact of the universe

513
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
it's just a thing people do it's a thing businesses do because I know people I mean lots of lots of businesses lots of stores just

514
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
have like one unisex bathroom like that's pretty normal I do the do those people have to put a notice off that says trans people are allowed to use

515
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:57,000
their one bathroom I don't know it's just such a weird you know that the continued to be like a part of the discussion around trans people

516
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:06,000
it's just the answer then excuse to say I think they should be ostracized they don't really care about where they're shitting the answer

517
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:16,000
then is that you can just say you can just call both your you have two bathrooms you can just say like oh yeah they're unisex they're both unisex

518
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:25,000
bathroom one has a picture of a man and the other has a picture of a woman on it but that's just a dog whistle that's just that's just an accident I didn't

519
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I didn't mean to put those up there they're both they're both unisex bathrooms it's fine it's no notice no you're not allowed in unless you're literally wearing a dress or

520
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:46,000
no big yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it on my good establishment thank you very much government out of out of my house please

521
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:57,000
it's all stupid it's very stupid it's insulting it's an insult when you think about it it's just spite it's just spite and I don't know cruelty

522
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:07,000
just to be just to be cruel just to say fuck it's literally literally just owning the libs it's literally just legislation passed to own the libs and make people feel bad that you don't like

523
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and it's great and I I love it I love it's exhausting yeah hideous hideous miscarriage of justice Lamal

524
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:37,000
so cool the other day what else yeah the other day I was trying to do some drawing and I and I got a whole one panel done and then yeah

525
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the end of the day happened I was like oh were you were you on panel were you streaming no I was gonna I'm I'm thinking of streaming soon next month

526
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:06,000
well I guess this month when this episode comes out on on Twitch I guess that's what I was doing before I want to go over the the Clarissa comic I want to add shading because I was rushing I didn't add any shading to any of the pages

527
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I wanted to so I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna like draw the rest of the comic so that it's finished and that the stream is like a good way to force myself to get some of that done

528
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but there was this other comic that I was originally going to do for the Cato anthology that I couldn't because of illness didn't have the energy to get done in time and I've been wanting to finish that and it's going real slow

529
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I look at the sketches and I'm like I don't fucking know how to turn this into a thing so I managed to do one panel line art and that was it and then I played video games the rest of the day

530
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I had

531
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm I'm worse because a couple days ago like two or three I think like two ish days ago I opened up manga studio because I had to make

532
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:20,000
a sprite I needed to make a new not not just a set of sprites for the for the game and it was very daunting and I was getting frustrated with it because it wasn't coming out right and I finally was like I don't I'm getting mad I don't want to work on this anymore

533
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:32,000
so when I played some Noida and I haven't worked on it since and it's been like two days I just played Noida for like two days straight I'm sorry I'm sorry that's true

534
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I mean it that's how the reason I got so stuck was because the sketch I had was too vague I was like I was looking at it and I'm like but I'm on line art mode in line art mode I don't want to think I just want to draw and then I could see the sketch

535
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm like where do I put the torso here I don't even know oh god it's so messy I'd have to redo the sketch and as soon as I realized I would have to redo the sketch I stopped I was like okay I'll I'll just you know I'll just go diarrhea in the women's restroom that's all I want to do right now

536
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that's that's your that's your solution to everything give you can't solve all your problems and diarrhea in the women's restroom

537
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
well where I was supposed to diarrhea

538
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't know fucking the just do it in my unisex bathroom that has a picture of

539
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
just do it on the floor

540
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
personal address on it

541
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that should that should be the way to protest all of this bathroom stuff

542
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:40,000
not none sits is only bathrooms just shit on the floor yeah why not why not

543
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000

545
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
just go to the go to the roof and like shit on them from the roof through the windows

546
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:24,000
the discourse becomes you know I I don't have any problem with trans people a lot of my I have empathy for them a lot of my friends I have a lot of many trans friends however I just can't get behind that they just keep shitting on me from the roof tops

547
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
everywhere you go

548
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
you know

549
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
America's like a flock of birds

550
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
this this is Joe Biden's America

551
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:43,000
you have BLM burning our cities down and then the ones that are still standing you have trans people sitting on people from on top of the buildings that are still standing

552
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
it's epidemic across just in time for covid to die down we have a new epidemic of trans people's diary

553
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
what do they think they're doing it's unsanitary

554
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
yes

555
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
this is this is what you've reduced me to

556
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm so glad I voted for Biden to make this happen

557
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I gotta say though that two days of playing Noida was very very fruitful

558
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I accomplished many goals I accomplished new things that I've never done before I had the ultimate God run I've started abusing abusing save states

559
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,000
because I had the perfect run I became an ultimate God and I'm like this is it this is the run this is the run where I do it all

560
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I collect I gathered all the four essences and I brought them to the moon I cracked the moon and then I went down to hell and I took them to the hell moon and I cracked the hell moon

561
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and I did it I did both I did both moon things I know I know pretty cool pretty cool

562
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I did I did a cool game thing to do

563
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
now I never have to do those again tell me about your cool gamer thing if you dare

564
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
well I have been if you think it can compare to cracking the moon

565
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
oh it can it can so you know I've been I've been into Picross and stuff

566
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
on on Picross this website Picrolyo.com slash Picross I remember exactly

567
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:31,000
cool website I think I've mentioned it for they have the maximum size of a random Picross board with randomized spaces is 30 times 30

568
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and recently I finally after like hundreds of failures I've completed one without any mistakes

569
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
30 times 30 Picross board

570
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:53,000
if you if you look at this image pretty good sense of way I'm not looking at the image of how much how daunting that could be

571
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:01,000
one slip up one incorrect click and it's completely over so everything had to be calculated

572
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and it was it was so gratifying

573
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,000
yeah that's a lot of squares that's that's a lot of squares how long did that take

574
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I mean this it doesn't take that long maybe an hour

575
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
sometimes if I get stuck it can take a couple days on and off but most of the time

576
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:31,000
it's just the the stamina required and like the the brain power and then the the paying attention to exactly where you're clicking

577
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
if you make one mistake if I like think I'm clicking on one column and it's actually the column next to it that I should be clicking on

578
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and I make a mistake then it's over I can continue but I won't get the rainbow at the end I won't get the perfect ending

579
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
because all the blocks go rainbow colors and flash rainbow if you don't make any mistakes and get a hundred percent of the time

580
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and yeah that I failed because of like slip ups and like not paying attention enough or like losing my patience

581
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
fucking something up or there have been so many of these where I get so close to the end and then there's a 50 50

582
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it could be one it could be another there's no way to know there's no information that I could use to figure it out

583
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
it could just be this one or another one and I get it wrong and that's happened like six or seven times

584
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:33,000
but this time this particular map was was no guesses it was the perfect board and I completed it completely

585
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and I didn't have to guess and it was so and I never have to play pick us again

586
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:48,000
you finally unfortunately unfortunately I do have to play Noida some more because I cracked the moons

587
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:58,000
but I have not I have not made the sun which I gotta make the fucking sun I guess

588
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
the best way to make the sun is to get the wife and in pregnant

589
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
you gotta you gotta you gotta like you gotta I gotta go beat all these like bosses that didn't used to be

590
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
and when I started playing they weren't in the game but they've been added so I gotta go fight all these new bosses

591
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
get some new items they drop do some shit to them and then throw some other like rare items in them to make them do things

592
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and then it makes a son and then I gotta take the sun from one place to another place and it's very dangerous

593
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
because it turns everything the lava and then fucking if you it kills you it deals you insane damage

594
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:46,000
if you go inside of the sun it will like atomize you and turn you into gold you know it's it's pretty fucked up

595
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
you have to throw the poop stone in it to turn it into a black hole if you if you're real spicy

596
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
which I I want to do that it's very it's pretty fucking tedious though honestly all the endgame Noida stuff

597
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
there's a lot of like it's a lot of running around getting shit you got to do and I I got so strong

598
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
but it's all pretty trivial like I'm I have like I can like swim in lava now I can swim in acid I'm like

599
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm all immune to almost I can just run through curse rock which is like the deadliest thing in the game

600
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
nothing gonna hurt me anymore so it's just a matter of like I mean yeah that's just what happens

601
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
like when you when you when you play long enough and you like go to enough like parallel worlds and get enough power-ups

602
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
you can just make yourself like you're not completely invincible you can never be completely immune to like polymorph

603
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:49,000
but other than that it's like I'm pretty set I'm pretty much pretty much just a matter of go to the different places

604
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and collect all the shit you need to get bring them back do the thing kind of a lot of busy work honestly it's honestly not that fun

605
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
it's more fun just because of this it's more fun just because like it sounds cool to talk about

606
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,000
but like the actual the actual doing of it is like okay I gotta go to these four places that are on four different parts of the map

607
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
and get the item and then I bring them up to this place and always did I miss it okay I gotta kind of oh it's more left than there

608
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I'm gonna try and find it again and get my bearings okay I found it okay I got it all right now I gotta go down to hell

609
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and do the same thing in a different place okay I did it and just like takes a few hours

610
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
yeah I'm trying to think there's a few there's a few games that have that sort of experience where you level out the challenge

611
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:43,000
you're too powerful to die you can die if you feel like it but your skill level as a player is just you only need to put in the

612
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the barest amount of effort in order to beat anything and so yeah you're really just watching an avatar run around

613
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:59,000
and occasionally doing something it's like I don't the challenge is gone there's no reason for me to do this it feels like

614
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:09,000
like getting like a super ultimate weapon at the very very end of the game when you've already beaten it and it's like well what is the

615
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
it doesn't help you because you didn't need it anymore because I didn't need that to get to this point that was the challenge

616
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:25,000
now that I have the ultimate weapon I don't need it just throw it away yeah yeah

617
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:40,000
hang on I gotta pee oh my god I just um I put so much I put so much time in Innoida that I feel like yeah the final the final

618
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:49,000
quests are they're very complicated and they're very like esoteric actually doing them is like once

619
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:58,000
you're once you're basically god level it's not that hard it's not really a challenge it's basically just like looking up how to do it

620
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and then just do it I I think I mean if you were doing it with no spoilers if you were like figuring out all the lore yourself

621
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
that would be the real challenge I I feel maybe a little bad that I looked up how to do it because like there are clues in the

622
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
game that you can find that hint at what you're supposed to do and I can only imagine that if I had done it like that I would be

623
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,000
like whoa I would just be blown away if I ever fucking but I don't think I would I don't think I would have done it

624
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:42,000
is it so esoteric you oh yeah I'm just saying I'm saying that I think the real challenge of the Noida endgame is like piecing together the clues

625
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:51,000
that it gives you to figure out how to do things like make the sun but I didn't do that and I don't think I would have done it

626
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I just looked I just looked it up yeah I just looked it up I don't think I would have done it I don't think I would have had the patients to

627
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:07,000
legitimately like go through run after run like trying different like oh it says that like the sun can be like corrupted with an intoxicating influence

628
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:16,000
like does that mean I have to put whiskey into it oh no no I have to I have to use the I have to use the essence of spirits at the

629
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
nullifying altar to get the poop stone I have to and now I can't just throw it into the sun I have to enter the sun and it will eat it from me and that's how you make the black hole

630
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:36,000
like I just wouldn't do it like would experimenting trial and error would that be extremely costly like you'd have to throw items together and then they'd be useless afterwards

631
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and you'd have to do that a bunch of times to figure out what they actually mean because that's yeah like it's like it's really hard to get like the poop stone for instance to if you like were to just throw it into the sun

632
01:06:48,000 --> 01:07:02,000
thinking that that's what you need to do and the sun just destroys it then you're like okay well that was the only one I was going to get I need to I need to like do a whole I need to go gather up all the orbs bring all the orbs back to the altar

633
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:15,000
enter like the next level new game plus and then go get the essence of spirits again go do the do the whole Sunseed quest again and then get the poop stone again throw that in and see if it works and you have to do something

634
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:31,000
different with it this time yeah stuff like that I just wouldn't do it yeah I can't imagine anyone doing something it's it feels like I mean a lot of the a lot of the lore in the game is like it's like it feels sort of like Fez and that like it's not designed to be

635
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:46,000
solved by one person it's designed to be like a sort of community mystery to solve you know I hate that I don't know why but I just hate like things that are that rely on the existence of a large player based of a large community to form that

636
01:07:47,000 --> 01:08:05,000
like you're banking on that being the case but like I'd rather it just be like a puzzle that you can solve with your own wit it just makes so much more satisfying to be to be the one who can figure it out and then say to your friends I know how to do it

637
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:25,000
the Sunseed quest I feel like some of the things are explicit enough that you could maybe figure it out but some of the other things like the like the lore snippets that are like hidden in like the tablet alters that you need to bring like certain fluids to and fill the alters with to make like this secret text appear

638
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and then you got to translate it from fucking finish and do like a rune cipher on it that stuff is like I don't think one person is meant to solve it and I I think that's cool in theory but I don't want to engage with it on that level I don't really

639
01:08:42,000 --> 01:09:01,000
like feel like being some guy on a forum who's like okay this guy posted screenshots of the runes I ciphered them my friend I showed it to my friend who speaks finish and he told me that it means this so this is the next snippet and I'll add it to like the next one and then tomorrow I'll go and do another one or whatever

640
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't want to play the game that way it's for other people I just want to be a little man who shoots guns that's that's for me yeah I feel like if you want to puzzle then you should play a puzzle game where like that is an expected thing so you go into it

641
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:39,000
honing your skills at puzzle solving so that when you come up to like the difficult ones you're you're into it you don't need to look up the results like the what you need to do in like a point and click game if you end up looking up what you need to do you don't like the game it sucks and you don't want to play it

642
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't I don't think I agree I I do think it's cool that it's a game that you can just play on a surface level of I'm a little man's I run around I shoot guns I kill monsters I beat the boss I win but then on top of it there's another layer of like

643
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:16,000
oh did you know that if you go into the fucking underground jungle and go west to the lucky layer and at the bottom there's an altar and if you fill the altar with you know curse liquid then it shows secret text and it forms like 136 of like the sacred text of like the gods or whatever that explains like where the world how the world was

644
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:39,000
formed I think that's really cool I just don't feel like doing it I guess I guess yeah I guess it's it's not bad that it's not explained I think it's just the the feeling that it gives you that some things you can figure out and then there's other things that you could try to figure

645
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:54,000
out but it would just take a really really long tedious time so they may they may as well have not given you a hint for this the you know the poopstone something if that was the only way like the only way to figure it out is to do extremely lengthy tedious bullshit or you

646
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:10,000
could just go to Wikipedia yeah it does make me feel bad it does kind of negatively impact my experience of the game because it makes me feel bad that I'm not going to do all that stuff I'm that I'm not like you know solving

647
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:30,000
the Sunseed quest on my own but that's a me problem the the the I tried I don't know one time I tried to do a full run where I found everything and it was so hard it was like I spent so long I was I was God mode I had everything I needed I could go anywhere do

648
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:47,000
anything and I I didn't find like half of the fucking stuff like there's stuff I spent like so long just going everywhere I could think of just going random places just searching and searching and searching for stuff and I didn't find all the stuff I

649
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:02,000
was looking for and I didn't even find like a bunch of the stuff that I know is in the game like a bunch of the secret bosses that I've never even seen seen before but they're there and I guess I'm just not a fucking hardcore enough gamer I don't

650
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I don't know the game fucking beat me there were like whole biomes I don't even know where they're the whole the power I didn't find the power plant for ever I don't know it's embarrassing I feel a little embarrassed just saying I don't think like hardcore gamer to such a degree even really could exist like imagine a single person never

651
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:35,000
but it but it killed it out everything but it kills me because in hindsight I know that I could have found it if I had like if I had ever decided to you know go

652
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:50,000
further below the sand caves oh and then under the sand caves there's the there's the overgrown caverns okay well then if what if I go even further then I find the power plant like I could have done that I just never did and I think maybe the

653
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:09,000
honestly I think maybe the reason that I didn't do that is because I know that there is a wiki that I can just look shit up on maybe if there was no wiki I would have just played the game the right way and just gone exploring like that and found shit and then I would still be in the process

654
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
in the process of being like oh wow there's a there's a secret fifth essence at the bottom of the lake like oh my god like wow

655
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:33,000
but there is a wiki and there's what's the point what's the point of wondering what could have been I don't know so I don't know I'm a little annoyed now I'm a little annoyed I feel like I've been robbed of that but also

656
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I the thing is it's because it's my fault and there's no one to be mad at but myself well it's because the game has that first level of you could just play the game as a shooty guy shooting things and shooty shooty McShooter like hell yeah

657
01:13:47,000 --> 01:14:11,000
chainsaw chainsaw yeah yeah you can do that and because of that the game fundamentally is not about like the draw of the game is not fundamentally exploration in that way you can explore but it's more fun to just go pew pew with the with the one right like that's why you're into the game

658
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:26,000
that's for so many yeah that it would be more interesting to do the exploration and the shooting stuff is like less interesting I think the fact is some people find like any any game that has like multiple facets of it

659
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:48,000
there's only certain people who would who would bother to do all of this extreme experimenting to find the super secrets and and and like the play base may not all be into that sort of gameplay because it's not the main point of the game that's why I was talking about with like point and click adventures nobody plays a point and click adventure

660
01:14:49,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and and look stuff up if they can help it only when they're terrible only if they're like terribly terribly stuck or if they just don't like that sort of game and they've found themselves playing it.

661
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It's it's a little I don't know I feel about it it's a little weird because you have to be you have to be a certain level baseline proficient at running and jumping and being a little shooty man.

662
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:23,000
In order to be able to do the like advanced like oh I found the cauldron room under the he see he see base.

663
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh I found the I found the 34 the 34th orb in the like the secret like one in 10 million great chest or whatever.

664
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You have to be able to like at the very least you know beat the game and and get all the power ups and stuff that you need.

665
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So it's not it's not like you can just do one or the other you have to be good at the one before you have the opportunity to do the other.

666
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think it's just cool.

667
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It's cool but it's also like damn it sure must be if like you're just someone who wants to explore the lore and the world but also it's like kind of cool that like you kind of have to be good at shooting and killing because like I don't know it's sort of like like the real world

668
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
like you don't just get to do shit you have to earn it.

669
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Even if it's not fair that you have to do that.

670
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I lost my train of thought because you made me wait.

671
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Sorry.

672
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

673
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
What was it?

674
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Fucking did different types of people you do shooting you do exploration later it's like a skill.

675
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:41,000
People who get to such a proficient level by playing the game like on the baseline is like the normal gameplay loop.

676
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
If you like that and it's fun you'll keep playing you'll get your game like a lot of experience by playing the game over and over again.

677
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Once you get so bored of things you've seen you start to get curious and then you might go out and try something different try something that you know.

678
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
That's how you get to a point where you can do all of the exploration and find all of these secrets while being proficient because you had to be proficient together in the first place.

679
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Those sorts of people really really love the core gameplay and I guess it's just a matter of like you don't know if a game is going to be worth exploring that much.

680
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And so you would only play it that much in order to find those things if you just love the game and would play it over and over again for hundreds of thousands of hours anyway.

681
01:17:34,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I had a very frustrating experience I was I had two stacks of the glass cannon perk which basically makes your it quintuples your damage and it also like increases the radius of all explosions that you make including even ones just like from a chainsaw so basically just everything I do just explodes fucking everywhere right.

682
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And I needed to go to a certain place and put stuff into these three like bowls basically to activate an altar that would remove all my perks because I wanted to remove some of them and just keep a few.

683
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So, and I know that this place requires me to fill one with blood, one with whiskey and one with silver, and I knew how to get silver.

684
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I had I had the means to create it, but I didn't have any means to transport it because the only way to transport silver is in a bag and bags are I mean I'd seen them around but I'm pretty sure I had destroyed all bags by just blasting black holes everywhere and like

685
01:18:44,000 --> 01:19:03,000
tearing holes through the landscape to travel. So I had to go like I had to go through like half a dozen different maybe I had to go through like three or four whole different like biomes going down through places where I thought that I might find bags and then I'm like nope none here and then I had to go to the next

686
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:17,000
parallel world over and go through the same area like looking for bags looking for bags. Oh, no, none here none here and I, I finally found a bag, but it was underwater, and I had to.

687
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And I had this is one of the perks one of the reasons I wanted to do this thing was I had a perk that froze liquids anytime I came near them.

688
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And so I couldn't get the bag without freezing the water. And then if I tried to break the ice that formed when I went in to get the bag, it would explode and it would destroy the bag because I had I was double glass cannon I was exploding with power.

689
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:58,000
So I had to like very carefully go under the water that it was in and like really carefully try and make explosions to like just break a little hole in the in the ground under the water to let the water drain out of it so that I could get on top of the bag and grab it without freezing the water it was in.

690
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And I failed several times. And every time I failed and destroyed the bag, I would have to go the next parallel world over go back to the same spot that I found the bag in find it again and try again to like break the ground in just such a way without destroying the bag.

691
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Finding this bag to hold silver in was a big fucking shit show.

692
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It was kind of funny thing.

693
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Is it like silver?

694
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Yeah.

695
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
No silver like silver like powder, basically.

696
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Like, yeah, there's I mean, you could leave you get a torn off a little bit of your like cloak and made a bag out of that and in real life.

697
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, in real life, it should not have been hard to find bags and I had found bags before I just I don't.

698
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I hadn't needed any bags so I hadn't kept them and they had all just been discarded and and destroyed.

699
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Yeah, pretty pretty dumb.

700
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:05,000
There are there are there are ways to make silver so like getting there's a bunch of different ways you there are other metals you can find that you can mix with liquids that transform them into silver.

701
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And the way that I did it was I had a spell called chaotic transmutation that will apply a sort of random like turn other liquids into something effect to a projectile.

702
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So I could just fire that into like a big pool of water and eventually it would fire a projectile that would turn a big chunk of liquid into silver and I would just collect the silver.

703
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
What I ended up doing was I use that and I fired a crystal that was that would turn stuff into silver.

704
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And then I poured blood I fired that down a hole and then I poured blood down the hole.

705
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So the blood would flow over this crystal and like kind of tumble down the hole on the other side of the crystal having been transformed into powdered silver.

706
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Oh my God.

707
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I love Noida so much.

708
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Alchemy.

709
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm so smart.

710
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm so intelligent because I play this video game that's kind of hard.

711
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Cool.

712
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
My throat hurts.

713
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

714
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I feel like I've monopolized feel like we've monopolized this podcast with Noida talk.

715
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Well, I got having having having done the moon quest.

716
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I think I'm going to take a break from it for a while.

717
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Back to the fucking.

718
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
The insane says he's going to take a break.

719
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I wonder what that means.

720
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Shut up.

721
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Yeah.

722
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
What were you saying?

723
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Oh, well, I wanted to talk a little bit about the road of ghosts.

724
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Oh, yes.

725
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, yes.

726
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
The Keto guys.

727
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Keto.

728
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
The Keto anthology.

729
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh, no.

730
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Fuck yeah.

731
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
How embarrassing for them.

732
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
To be even slightly similar to Keto.

733
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
The Keto anthology guys.

734
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
They were saying last episode about Lord Ghost Kickstarter.

735
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I got my, you know, I was thinking about it.

736
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I looked into printing costs and stuff.

737
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And, you know, could be done.

738
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I could do it.

739
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
By the time this podcast comes up, it may have been launched.

740
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I don't know because I'm scared.

741
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm scared of fucking it up and doing something stupid.

742
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
But yeah, I kind of really want to do that.

743
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Aren't we all?

744
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Ben, you did a comic Kickstarter.

745
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
What even the fuck?

746
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It was so easy.

747
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It was so easy.

748
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Nothing could have been simpler.

749
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Wait, what do you want to know?

750
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
What are you asking me?

751
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I guess the guest artists.

752
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Because I've contacted a few people about like doing like mini adventures.

753
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And I thought that was the thing you did.

754
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And I thought that was really cool.

755
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That would be a cool stretch goal for a lot of ghosts.

756
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But how does that work?

757
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I want to pay them obviously.

758
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But like, I don't know how much.

759
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
She probably asked.

760
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah, I don't know.

761
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Kind of depends on the artist.

762
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And then maybe just pay a page rate or just a flat, like, you know,

763
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
a certain amount per story.

764
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And then, you know, structure your structure, your stretch goals so that like,

765
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
okay, if we hit this much, then that's enough to cover, you know, one more,

766
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
you know, story added to the thing, including like paying the artist,

767
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
plus the like printing costs of adding more pages.

768
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And, you know, yeah.

769
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You just got to make the numbers add up one way or another.

770
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's just a lot of like, like information I need that I couldn't possibly have yet.

771
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Such as how many pages they're going to be, how long,

772
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I mean, I guess it doesn't matter how long they're going to take.

773
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
But like, the, well, the amount of effort they put in,

774
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
should I pay them a working rate for how long they work?

775
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I don't know.

776
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I don't know.

777
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
That's, I mean, that's like depends on the artist.

778
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You can make any offer you want.

779
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You can be like, I'll pay an hourly rate.

780
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Honestly, I wouldn't pay an hourly rate because that's dependent on them to like track their hours.

781
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And I don't know.

782
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
That just seems weird.

783
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I would pay either just a page rate or like a flat rate for like,

784
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
make me this story, I will pay you this much.

785
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah.

786
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
That's one aspect of it.

787
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
It's the money thing.

788
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
But then, you know, presuming I get enough, like I'd obviously have it like,

789
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:56,000
stretch goals so that there's plenty of money so I can pay them rather than not enough.

790
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
But like, then there's the thing of like, writing these little stories.

791
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Like very vague ideas.

792
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Like, oh, that could be something with hippo and in bit secondy.

793
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
That's new, new by the sea, aka Neo York.

794
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah.

795
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Well, it's like, you know, there's like little adventures with these characters.

796
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
There's plenty of characters.

797
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
This is big city stuff could happen.

798
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Yeah.

799
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Who knows?

800
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
That's cool.

801
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'd have to think of like something that was something.

802
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Because I've always been terrible with, I mean, efficient storytelling.

803
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I tell my stories in extremely long form.

804
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I can't write a short one.

805
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's impossible.

806
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Do you, I mean, do you, so you don't have like, concepts ready to go of like,

807
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
what the side stories would be?

808
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
No, I could, I could probably think of some stuff because there's plenty to work with.

809
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah.

810
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But yeah, I mean, what, what was your creation process for?

811
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Honestly, my friends, I fucking was so bad at that.

812
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I had, you know, they came out really well and all the guest artists made really good

813
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
stuff.

814
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But honestly, and this might be discouraging and I'm sorry, but like, I feel like I was

815
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
not good at that.

816
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It took me so long and so much like hand wringing and fucking pulling my hair out to get myself

817
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
to like settle on a concept of like, what should the vaporettes be about?

818
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
What kind of stories will they be?

819
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Who's going to draw which one?

820
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And then actually sitting down and scripting them.

821
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I, I think they came out well, but I, I found it so painful.

822
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I don't know if I, I don't know.

823
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I don't want to say I don't know if I should do it again because I really like the end

824
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
results.

825
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
But boy was it hard.

826
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Boy, I really struggled with it.

827
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And that was a lot of the, that was a big part of the reason why it took so long for the

828
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:14,000
comic to get done was because I didn't, because I didn't have them done before the Kickstarter

829
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
because I wanted to wait for the stretch goals to be met before I committed to them.

830
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Yeah.

831
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I feel like, I mean, I think the, what my stories are going to be about.

832
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I think I'm going to call them ghost stories just cause it's a lot of ghosts.

833
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

834
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Um, I feel like there's, it's easier because yours are like character things about Vincent

835
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
and Magda.

836
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yeah.

837
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And they go to highs, they go to college.

838
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Yeah.

839
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And we don't even know what they major in, I don't think, but we know Magda draws.

840
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
We do that.

841
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Uh, and it's like, it's the only thing you can write is like, interactions they have,

842
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
things from their life.

843
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah.

844
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Like character story building.

845
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
With what I have is like, I've got an established world.

846
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
You had a bunch of wacky shit.

847
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Yeah.

848
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I could have, I was thinking of having like a story just about the brickie brawlers and

849
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
the mutton shunters.

850
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Just fighting, just a couple of them.

851
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

852
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah.

853
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I mean, that's the, yeah, that's the, um, like actually writing the dialogue was not that

854
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
hard, but settling, settling on and committing to a, okay, I should might write a vaporette

855
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
script where this happens.

856
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
This is the concept that I want to make.

857
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I was like, I was just really bad at that of thinking of them and of committing to them,

858
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
which was like the hardest part for me.

859
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Um, yeah, maybe it would be easier for you because your setting is more diverse, I guess.

860
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It's more like shit.

861
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I think, I think I could come up with some simple ideas.

862
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I just, I worry that the ideas I come up with would be too long.

863
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Like, because I mean, Laura ghost was not supposed to be almost a hundred pages long.

864
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And yet there it is.

865
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Yeah.

866
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Well, I mean, maybe if you, maybe if you're coming up with ideas, you know, you, you,

867
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
you know, you come up with maybe a list and then you go through, you pick out your favorites

868
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and then you write them, you script them and then you just see like, okay, this one was

869
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
too long.

870
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
So I'll do it later.

871
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Or this one didn't come out as good as I, as I thought.

872
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
So I'll, you know, I just won't do that one.

873
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Just, I don't know, just pick the ones that are the right size.

874
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And I know that means that like work might end up getting left on the cutting room floor

875
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
because some might not pan out or whatever.

876
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I don't know.

877
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I think I feel like that ultimately the, the, the issues that will come from this Kickstarter

878
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
idea, they're not that big.

879
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I am just like worried that I will, I will make a huge mistake or like, like sending

880
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
the packages like, oh, that's scary.

881
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I've not done that before.

882
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Sending the packages sucks and takes forever.

883
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And I was still doing it like months after because people were late with their, with

884
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,000
their surveys and, you know, and that's just stuff you got to accept is going to happen.

885
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It was whatever.

886
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I mean, I had, I had all this stuff.

887
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Like I bought a whole bunch of like the envelopes and stamps and shit.

888
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So like I was ready to go, but it meant like, you know, a week would go by and then I would

889
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:50,000
check and there'd be a few more surveys filled out and I gotta make another trip to the post office.

890
01:31:50,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And I mean, you were asking me about international shipping before and like, boy, international

891
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
shipping can get expensive.

892
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And I assume that, I mean, we probably have a similar demographic that reads our stuff.

893
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And most people that I was fulfilling were in America.

894
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So probably it would be the same for you.

895
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So probably those would all become international shipping, which is unfortunate.

896
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It's unfortunate.

897
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I forget.

898
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And in Kickstarter, do you like, does the person buying put their location and then the shipping

899
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
gets added on to the price?

900
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Or do I have to set the price of the, the goals or like the thing to accommodate shipping?

901
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It's per tier.

902
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:53,000
So like you can, if two different tiers have different rewards, you can set different shipping

903
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
for each tier.

904
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And then for each tier, you can, you can specify like a general shipping amount, but you can

905
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
also specify like by country.

906
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Like you can say like, okay, and I do this for vapors, you can say like, okay, in the

907
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,000
United States, no shipping, Mexico or Canada, $2.

908
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Everywhere else, $5.

909
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Like you can specify.

910
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And yeah, I assume they have to specify their country when they pledge.

911
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I think it works like that.

912
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Okay.

913
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
So I was doing some calculations.

914
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I think something like 15 pounds, maybe a little less would be like the price of the

915
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
comic, uh, physical.

916
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah.

917
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And then I would have, I would make, I would, I would get a pin made of like the little ghosts

918
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
that's on the cover.

919
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Like badly drawn little ghost that I think that would be a cute pin.

920
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I'd wear that.

921
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Uh, then there's like, I don't know, rewards.

922
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Like I, I don't know whether I could draw little doodles as good as the ones you made

923
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
for like the personalized vapors too.

924
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Those are really good.

925
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I put like way too much effort into those.

926
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I don't know.

927
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Yeah.

928
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I, um, but I mean, I charged a lot.

929
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
My, my like signed and drawing tier was like pretty expensive.

930
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So I kind of felt like I should put some, I should put energy into these.

931
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And I did.

932
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I mean, you could always do like a, a more moderate one that really is like just a doodle.

933
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah.

934
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I guess I could do a little doodle.

935
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Like I could have a signed version and then a doodle version with a sign.

936
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Yeah.

937
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Uh, I've thought about it.

938
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I thought about things.

939
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I think it's not even that far from being real.

940
01:34:50,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I just need to like make the PDF and, uh, and write some of the, the guest art things

941
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
and see what happens.

942
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Make the thinker stretch goals.

943
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I have no idea what I'm going to do for stretch goals other than dick guest artists.

944
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Uh, you had some fun ones.

945
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Yeah.

946
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Uh, oh, well.

947
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Yeah.

948
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Once I hit, I had a bunch in mind.

949
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And then once they all got hit, because, because like I, I planned my tears pretty much.

950
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Um, like I set the prices pretty low so that like what I was, what I was asking for a tier

951
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
was not much more than what it was going to cost.

952
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So like hitting another tier didn't really increase my profit much.

953
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
All like most of the extra money just went back into, you know, adding the thing.

954
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Right.

955
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So they were all pretty close together, you know, guest artists, guest artists, guest

956
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
artists.

957
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Um, and yeah.

958
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So we hit all, all the stretch goals I had in mind.

959
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
We hit them pretty fast because I set the prices for low.

960
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And then I was like, well, uh, and I just made shit up.

961
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Made funny shit up.

962
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And, uh, I don't know.

963
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I just made a joke out of it.

964
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Made it, uh, kind of, kind of in a failure of branding, I made the stretch goals for

965
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Vapors two related to, uh, fine and punishment.

966
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Yeah.

967
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Which I guess is fine, but it's a weird decision in hindsight, but I don't know.

968
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I thought it was funny.

969
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
It was.

970
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And it became.

971
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah.

972
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

973
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Yeah.

974
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Yeah.

975
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
True.

976
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yeah.

977
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
True.

978
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Oh God.

979
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It makes me so upset.

980
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Oh God.

981
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
It makes me so upset to think about that because that was like a year and a half ago.

982
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
So that was like a year and a half ago and I was drawing slime and punishment then.

983
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
God.

984
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
No.

985
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Why?

986
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Why did it take me so long?

987
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Why did it take me so long to make the video and then to make the game?

988
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I'm gonna freak out.

989
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I mean, oh, the video, you mean the animation, right?

990
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yeah, the animation.

991
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I mean, there was a lot of stuff on everybody's mind in 2020.

992
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
But yeah, I don't know.

993
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Things take time, I guess.

994
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Being not focused enough on work is potentially a problem.

995
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I think it's a healthy mixture of external stresses and personal and professional failures on my part.

996
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It's a nice healthy mix of both of those things.

997
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
What is that?

998
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
God.

999
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I still, it's so, it's so weird to me to think that it was a year and a half ago that I was drawing slime and punishment.

1000
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
To me, it still feels like the thing that I'm drawing.

1001
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And it kind of is because I have more of it left to do to come out for the finale.

1002
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
God, I got to fucking get it done.

1003
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I just, I want it done so bad.

1004
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:10,000
All the more reason to focus on that and to stop yigging, to stop yig posting.

1005
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Stop yigging.

1006
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Stop yigging.

1007
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Stop noiding.

1008
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I mean, yeah.

1009
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Yeah, I know.

1010
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Every second I spend thinking about yig is probably wasted.

1011
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
But I don't know.

1012
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Everyone needs a hobby.

1013
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
No, you do know.

1014
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
No.

1015
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Everyone needs a hobby.

1016
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Your hobby can be noisy.

1017
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
That's fine.

1018
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Don't worry about it.

1019
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Oh, I could, I could, I guess I could try to make the punk plush a really high stretch goal.

1020
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I guess the only problem with that is how do I, how do people get it?

1021
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Like, do I make a tier?

1022
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Do I change the tiers later?

1023
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Like, and if we get the pump thing, you get this, you get it.

1024
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
You can, you can add a new tier later.

1025
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:15,000
You can't change an existing tier once the, once the project is launched, but you can add a new one.

1026
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Right.

1027
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So if I hit the punk plush stretch goal.

1028
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Yes.

1029
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I can add the punk plush as well tier.

1030
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And then they could get that in there.

1031
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Then the shipping would be way more because it's, it's not, it's not a letter.

1032
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's a package.

1033
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I mean, people would have to, people would have to change their tier to the plush tier and that would have to come with a, you know, an increased shipping costs.

1034
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I mean, I think that's, that's, that's just the reality of the situation.

1035
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Yeah, but that's, that's what I said is the reason the plush one didn't work out is because there was no, like lower, it was a very high.

1036
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,000
What's the word floor, a very high barrier to entry.

1037
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
There was no like, like more moderate, like 10 or $15 reward.

1038
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It was just like like 50 bucks and up.

1039
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Right.

1040
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I think I had some, some shitty, like low things where it's like, oh, well, it's a thank you like a tip jars for $5.

1041
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
You won't get anything, but thanks.

1042
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And then 10 was like, I'll give you a doodle.

1043
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
No, I think terrible.

1044
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I think that the plush as like a higher tier reward, yes, a stretch goal and then a higher tier reward to go along with something that is more modestly priced like a comic book.

1045
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I think that would work out really well.

1046
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Yeah.

1047
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's similar in that is punk is not related to Lord of Ghosts.

1048
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
But yeah.

1049
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah.

1050
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I mean, you could make a Lord of Ghost plush.

1051
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
He'd make a nice little, I mean, I guess, I guess that's a lot.

1052
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I guess that's a lot of work to just throw around so casually.

1053
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
He would make a nice plush though.

1054
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
He would.

1055
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I think that the only problem with that is that I'd have to contact the company.

1056
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
They'd have to approve.

1057
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Well, they wouldn't have to approve the design or just say, okay, we'll make this and it will take like a month.

1058
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,000
They'll send me a sample and then only then would I have something to show people what they would be purchasing.

1059
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And before then, you know, I don't know whether it would be even worth getting hype about, but I know what the punk plush would look like.

1060
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I already have one.

1061
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Potential.

1062
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
There's potential in that.

1063
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I mean, what if a little lot of ghosts with his eyes.

1064
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
He's squishy.

1065
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Yeah.

1066
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
All his little eyes.

1067
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
His little arms.

1068
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
His little dangly arms.

1069
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I can just imagine like holding him.

1070
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Holding him like a little turd and just like twisting him around and making his and making his arms just kind of like flap.

1071
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1072
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah, I know.

1073
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:19,000
His arms like flapping, flapping hither and thither, twisting around like he's doing the twist.

1074
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Hell yeah.

1075
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I can see it.

1076
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I can see it in my mind's eye.

1077
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I could maybe have like a little sheet that goes over him.

1078
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I don't know whether that would be something I could ask them to make.

1079
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Oh my God.

1080
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Oh my God.

1081
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
That would be so cute.

1082
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
That would be so cute.

1083
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
That's almost too much to bear.

1084
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But yeah, you can do that.

1085
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Honestly, it wouldn't be that hard to like get some white cloth and make sheets myself, but that's.

1086
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Just make them yourself.

1087
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Yeah.

1088
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And then like.

1089
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I mean because I mean that's sort of the point of it is that it's kind of like a shitty

1090
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
homemade, you just fucking threw a sheet over him.

1091
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Yeah, you could just like cut.

1092
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Oh, that could be like premium.

1093
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Like it could be like the premium tier is he comes with the cloth that you just like cut out of a thing and drew some eyes on.

1094
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Oh, it's a cool idea.

1095
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Like the cool lot of ghosts where he has the sunglasses.

1096
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I don't know.

1098
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I don't know whether I'd be able to like make sunglasses or like buy a bunch of sunglasses to add on to that.

1099
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
That's a bit much.

1100
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
People can do what they like.

1101
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
But yeah, it's a cool idea.

1102
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It's funny.

1103
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Yeah.

1104
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Okay.

1105
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Okay.

1106
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Anything else to say about that?

1107
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I have one more thing on my list of going.

1108
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
No, I don't think there's anything more else to say.

1109
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I think it's just I got to figure out the money so that I know how high to put the.

1110
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:12,000
That's just be expect expect things to cost more than you think.

1111
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Oh, of course.

1112
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:20,000
In particular shipping shipping was like, I knew how much the comics were going to cost because they gave me a quote about that.

1113
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
So that wasn't so bad, but the shipping all ended up costing more than I thought.

1114
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
International shipping was always more than I expected it to be.

1115
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Yeah.

1116
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I don't know.

1117
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Just be like the worst possible thing.

1118
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
The worst possible thing that can happen with a Kickstarter is not that it fails.

1119
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:51,000
It's that it succeeds, but you realize that you fucked it up and asked for less than you needed and you're in the red now.

1120
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Yeah.

1121
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,000
God, I mean, the idea of getting the punk plush real or the Lord of Ghost plush.

1122
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yeah.

1123
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
It's really cool.

1124
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Yeah.

1125
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:13,000
The logistics of like ordering that, having it arrive and then having to get it to where I live alone is a lot.

1126
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And there's probably going to be customs charges that I'm going to have to pay for such a large shipment of plushes.

1127
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And then I'm going to have to package them maybe individually, like buy some amount of boxes.

1128
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Maybe I can save on shipping by holding the comics back until the plush is there for the people who got the plush.

1129
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And then I could send them together.

1130
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
That would be okay.

1131
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Maybe.

1132
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Yeah.

1133
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I mean, yeah.

1134
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
You've got to find every way to save on costs with things like that you possibly can.

1135
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Yeah, definitely send it all as one package.

1136
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
For sure.

1137
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Blimey.

1138
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Such a prospect.

1139
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I don't envy myself for doing that in the future.

1140
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Future Gib is fucked.

1141
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Future Gib is fucked only if she wins at the Kickstarter game.

1142
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I'm so scared.

1143
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I'm not prepared.

1144
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I'm not prepared for this massive endeavor of making money with art that I made.

1145
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It can't be done.

1146
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Is anybody ever really prepared?

1147
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It's like becoming a parent.

1148
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
You just got to do it.

1149
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Just like having a baby.

1150
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
The thing about it is that you just have to do it.

1151
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
You're forced to do it.

1152
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Gun to your head.

1153
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You don't have a choice.

1154
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You must.

1155
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
No one's ever ready, but you got to do it anyway.

1156
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You know, that's the perfect analogy.

1157
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I'm going to send out all these little babies, all these little lord ghosts.

1158
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Based.

1159
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
All right.

1160
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
That's something to look into.

1161
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Okay.

1162
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I should write down.

1163
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I'm just going to write down like a list of things to look into.

1164
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And then you can talk about your thing.

1165
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:22,000
My last thing that I want to complain about is this week I have been eating a lot.

1166
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And even worse, I've been door dashing a lot.

1167
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I've been ordering a lot of takeout, Chinese pizza, chicken, bro keto, whatever.

1168
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
My excuse.

1169
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I know it's bad.

1170
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
That's how you know it's bad.

1171
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
My excuse is that I've started lifting again, which is good.

1172
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
It feels good.

1173
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I'm strong now.

1174
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And I'm only getting stronger.

1175
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I'm going to, it's going to be really annoying when I have to move and I'm going to like lose

1176
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,000
access to my exercise equipment and I will then have to buy some more and set it up.

1177
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And for a while, I won't be able to lift.

1178
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I'll have to break my streak.

1179
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
But you know, what are you going to do?

1180
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It's going to be right.

1181
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It's going to be right as I'm getting into the swing of it too.

1182
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I'll be a couple months in and then I don't even want to think about it.

1183
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I don't know.

1184
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
So I'm getting fat, but I'm also getting strong.

1185
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So it's a wash.

1186
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It sounds like just the one.

1187
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
No.

1188
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Which one?

1189
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Which one does she mean though?

1190
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
If you're getting all of that first food in you, you're not going to be very fast for very long.

1191
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It's good for you.

1192
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Chicken.

1193
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I get a lot of fried chicken.

1194
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Well, I don't know fried, but yeah.

1195
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
It's the abundance of oils and stuff.

1196
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And fats.

1197
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Oil's good.

1198
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
It's keyed out.

1199
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
The pizza was indulgent.

1200
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I was just feeling like cheating.

1201
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I was like, fuck, I'm getting a pizza and I did.

1202
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I had pizza the other day.

1203
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Ow, it's bit my tongue.

1204
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Fuck.

1205
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Just eat.

1206
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Because I wanted to just eat.

1207
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:19,000
There's all these restaurants nearby that are like, oh, thousands upon thousands of upvotes.

1208
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Five stars.

1209
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Everyone loves this one.

1210
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I was like, okay, well, I've had that one.

1211
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Let's see this other one that's got like 90 upvotes and it's also like five stars.

1212
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,000
It's a much smaller looking, much less professional photography for their food.

1213
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I was like, yeah, it's Italian.

1214
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It seems more traditional.

1215
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I got it and it was the best pizza ever.

1216
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So that's real Italian.

1217
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I found a real Italian place.

1218
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Fascinating.

1219
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,000
It's always nice when you look for the stuff that nobody pays attention to.

1220
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It's something in your gut that feels like, yes, this is the real shit.

1221
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
The popular stuff is always bad.

1222
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
You got to go into the back streets and into the back alleys where the locals get their food.

1223
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Except it's like fast food in London.

1224
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I don't know, dude.

1225
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I just buy wings over.

1226
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I just buy wings over because they got good sauce and they're not Wingstop, which is criminally bad.

1227
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Wingstop is the worst fucking place I've ever eaten.

1228
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It's so bad.

1229
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I can't believe it's legal.

1230
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I can't believe it's legal that they serve the food that they do.

1231
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It's a nightmare.

1232
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
I just buy fucking tendies.

1233
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And you know what?

1234
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
They're rewarding me.

1235
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
They're giving me that Pavlovian.

1236
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,000
They give me that Skinnerbox treatment because sometimes I'll order from them and they'll just give me extra.

1237
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And then I'm like, oh my God, the value.

1238
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
They doubled my order one time.

1239
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I ordered six tendies and they gave me 12 tendies.

1240
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I was eating it the next day.

1241
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It was crazy.

1242
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
One time I ordered and they just gave me my order plus somebody else's order.

1243
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I feel like that might be a mistake and not a value for money.

1244
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I see two possibilities.

1245
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
One is that it was a mistake and they just gave me someone else's order and that other person was fucked.

1246
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
The other one was maybe that that order got canceled and they were just like, well, let's just give this other person's order to that other guy.

1247
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Because he's our beloved customer and he deserves it.

1248
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I hope it was the second one.

1249
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
They definitely had that conversation as well.

1250
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I mean, it's our beloved customer Ben saying.

1251
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
It's our beloved...

1252
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's the Tendi guy.

1253
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
It's the Tendi guy from Such and Such a Road.

1254
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Oh, we love that guy.

1255
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Oh, have you read his comics?

1256
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh yeah, he's very talented.

1257
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
And he's a great taste in sauce too.

1258
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
He always gets the hot garlic.

1259
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Oh, it's my favorite.

1260
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Beautiful.

1261
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Yeah, I just...

1262
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I don't know.

1263
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
When I'm when I'm lifting, I'm just like, got to eat big to get big.

1264
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:10,000
And it's more important to build muscle than it is to fucking keep my calories down.

1265
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
And I got to eat the calories to do that.

1266
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So fuck it.

1267
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And I don't know, it's fine.

1268
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
It's good.

1269
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It doesn't really matter.

1270
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:31,000
It's more of a good that I'm lifting again than it is a bad that I'm eating a little too much, you know?

1271
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So fuck it.

1272
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I can cut later.

1273
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I mean, I should...

1274
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I'm going to dial it back a little bit.

1275
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I had a fucking week.

1276
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I had a week of hedonistic gluttony.

1277
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But like, I can't...

1278
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I'm not going to keep that up because it's stupid.

1279
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
And like, I still want to be keto and whatever.

1280
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I've had a little issues lately with cooking.

1281
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
It's like, I want to cook.

1282
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I want to cook for myself because it's cheaper, mostly.

1283
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
And it's just as tasty, if not tastier than like the slump.

1284
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Well, in terms of money, right?

1285
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
You buy some fucking chicken breasts from the store and you just fry them.

1286
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
And I did that the other day.

1287
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I got some chicken breasts.

1288
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I put flour on them, some corn flour, salt and pepper, and just put them on the frying pan for ages.

1289
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And I took them off and I was like, wow, it's cooked.

1290
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I did it and I ate it and it was really good.

1291
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And that costs like so much less than it would have if I had ordered chicken from someplace.

1292
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Wait, did you say corn flour?

1293
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, it was just what I had.

1294
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,000
They said like you could use really just to put a coating on there.

1295
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Oh, sure.

1296
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Before you put it on the frying pan.

1297
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Yeah, I guess so.

1298
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I guess.

1299
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It wasn't like a deep fried chicken nugget sort of thing.

1300
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It was just sort of some stuff on it.

1301
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Pan fried.

1302
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Organa.

1303
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Yeah, sure.

1304
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Pan fried chicken.

1305
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
That was really, really nice.

1306
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You ever deep fry?

1307
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
No, I don't.

1308
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I guess I have a saucepan, so I could.

1309
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Deep frying is cool.

1310
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
But it takes so much grease.

1311
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
It takes so much grease.

1312
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
You can save the grease, you know, you can use it over and over again.

1313
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Save it where?

1314
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
In the saucepan?

1315
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Yeah, well, I mean, you can, you buy it in bottles.

1316
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
You can just like pour the oil into the pan, heat it up, cook in it, and then like let it cool.

1317
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:46,000
And then pour it back in the bottle, put the cap on, and use it again later.

1318
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I hadn't thought of that.

1319
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
It's pretty cool.

1320
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I mean, what else do you do?

1321
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Like pour it down the sink?

1322
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Like that's such a waste.

1323
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I suppose so.

1324
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:04,000
But yeah, I've been having trouble just because of like illness stuff, which is still happening, unfortunately.

1325
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And I'm like, I'm leaving things unwashed.

1326
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Like I'm not washing up after myself as much.

1327
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Like you're not.

1328
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And I'm like not cooking as many meals.

1329
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Sometimes I like only have dinner.

1330
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I don't have lunch.

1331
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I sort of have breakfast and then I have a linner or whatever.

1332
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And it's, it's good, but it's not good enough.

1333
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I'm not getting enough nutrients.

1334
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And so I end up ordering food and it's like, it sucks.

1335
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I don't like being in this situation where I'm not like the perfect chef or I'm not cooking meals, three meals a day.

1336
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It's like, it's a lot of work.

1337
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I don't like filling that gap with fast food because it's just so expensive.

1338
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's so convenient.

1339
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I love that that like concept is, is, is, you know, it has improved our lives.

1340
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:17,000
A humanity so much that if you are hungry and you have a phone with money, you can get food delivered right to your door immediately.

1341
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Like in like an hour and you could survive.

1342
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I, I'm, I'm glad that I have generally made a habit of buying groceries instead of ordering out.

1343
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Ordering out is such a fucking waste.

1344
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It's cool that it's a, it's an option.

1345
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Yeah, but it is, it is just so like, like, I don't know.

1346
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I guess there's nothing really to say other than I wish I was cooking more.

1347
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
But it's difficult.

1348
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's difficult when I only have one frying pan.

1349
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I have to clean it up for every single time.

1350
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Oh yeah, that kind of sucks.

1351
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Oh God, when I, when I move, I'm going to have to, oh no, I'm going to, I'm going to have to fucking get new kitchenware.

1352
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I'm going to have to get new pans and spatulas and shit.

1353
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Oh my God, this sucks.

1354
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Did I talk about how I have to move soon?

1355
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Did I mention that last week?

1356
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
You did mention that.

1357
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Well, I think so last week.

1358
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Yeah.

1359
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Oh, it sucks.

1360
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I haven't even, I haven't even started looking.

1361
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I have not even started looking for like a new place.

1362
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I don't, I think I'm a little in denial.

1363
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I don't want to deal with it.

1364
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I don't want to deal with it.

1365
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I don't want to deal with it.

1366
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
And I don't want to know what my rent is going to be.

1367
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
It's going to be so bad.

1368
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Just assume it's going to be like four billion dollars a month.

1369
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It is going to be, it's going to be like double.

1370
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
It's going to be like double what I pay now.

1371
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I know, I know it.

1372
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Well, you should rip the bandaid off, look around.

1373
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Like the longer you, like they could have been a good deal that you already missed

1374
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
because you haven't been looking.

1375
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Oh my God.

1376
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Yeah.

1377
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I got it.

1378
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You got to be doing that.

1379
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Sure.

1380
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Yeah.

1381
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I know.

1382
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I know you're right.

1383
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Oh, look at me.

1384
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm gay.

1385
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Ben.

1386
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I just do the smart thing instead of the stupid thing.

1387
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Pat yourself.

1388
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Pat yourself on the back.

1389
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I am.

1390
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
You fucking got it.

1391
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
You did it.

1392
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Congratulations.

1393
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Oh, I'm tired.

1394
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I'm tired.

1395
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm tired of this, this world, these people.

1396
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.

1397
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
You're tangled up in your own life.

1398
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Tangled is a good movie though.

1399
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It's okay.

1400
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Like that part where the guy's got all the swords pointed at him and he's like, hmm.

1401
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
This is going to be a meme one day.

1402
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Yeah, you could tell.

1403
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
He knew.

1404
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
He knew.

1405
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Uh, Finn Flynn Flynn Flynn.

1406
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Do you want to do voicemails?

1407
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Uh, yeah.

1408
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
The Lord of Ghost thing was the last thing I wanted to talk about.

1409
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So yeah, I'm good.

1410
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I've gone through my list.

1411
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
All right.

1412
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Let's get into it.

1413
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Are you on the speak pipe?

1414
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Are you on speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail where you listener can send us voicemail where

1415
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
we will answer, but only if it's good and you have something to say and you have charisma

1416
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
and are cool and, and don't waste our time, please.

1417
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
And thank you.

1418
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Yes, I am.

1419
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Okay.

1420
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Good.

1421
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Then our first voicemail of the day is called she her please smiley face.

1422
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Okay.

1423
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Three, two, one.

1424
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Go.

1425
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:46,000
So I've been rewatching sin figure because I finally wanted to catch up on the later seasons

1426
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
and I just remember what I used to be into this show since I came.

1427
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I was like, hang out in the disc horns, participate in community, rewatch events and stuff.

1428
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
And that shit's all gone now.

1429
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Those people that discord's dead.

1430
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Like I'm never, I'm never interacting with them again.

1431
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:11,000
And like, like maybe I'm tripping on my medication or whatever, but I got really emotional and

1432
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:17,000
the, the transience of everything just suddenly came and like hit me.

1433
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Just wanted to say like, give and Tom, Jesse, Nate, Munchie, Mange, uh, Davoo and even like

1434
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:35,000
even Trixie and everybody listening.

1435
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Like I'm glad this all happened.

1436
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:44,000
You know, you're fucking having a moment.

1437
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Yeah, but like, I'm glad this all happened.

1438
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I'm totally tripping.

1439
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,000
That's what's happening over it.

1440
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Be sad.

1441
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
It happened.

1442
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Be sad.

1443
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
It's continuing.

1444
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I can't tell if that was a joke or not.

1445
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I don't know what they were talking about at first with whatever community they were in.

1446
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Wait, wait, I want to listen to the, I want to hear the beginning again.

1447
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I'm going to play it again.

1448
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Uh, why does it take so long to sin, sin figure?

1449
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I've been rewatching.

1450
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I think it's just some thing they're into and they've noticed that the community is

1451
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
dead and the thing is dead and they're thinking about that happening to the PCP maybe.

1452
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Uh, whatever.

1453
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I don't know.

1454
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Life has changed.

1455
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Sorry, you're having a emotional moment over it.

1456
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Uh, you'll be fine.

1457
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I don't know.

1458
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I guess I appreciate the sincerity.

1459
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Uh, it's fine.

1460
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
It's, I don't know.

1461
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'm glad you liked stuff.

1462
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Uh, I feel a little bad.

1463
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I shouldn't shit on this person, but it's so easy.

1464
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Um, I don't know.

1465
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I guess that's all I have to say about it.

1466
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Next, next voice, next voicemail.

1467
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Thanks.

1468
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Thank you.

1469
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Uh, we love you.

1470
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Uh, next one is called.

1471
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Is Riley Trixie's Pimp or something?

1472
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Three, two, one, go.

1473
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Hey guys.

1474
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So I just want to say congratulations on finally getting the rad con content.

1475
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,000
You know, like, you know, real big shout out to that one guy who talked to Riley about

1476
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
it.

1477
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And that's why it happened.

1478
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Not fucking talking to Trixie directly like everyone's been doing.

1479
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
That was, um, trying to get this fucking rad con stuff.

1480
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
No, no, we got to talk to Riley.

1481
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Yeah.

1482
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
This person who was never involved and when he tried to get involved, she'll only do

1483
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
it if Riley tells her to, she'll only do it if Riley tells her to.

1484
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Thanks for Riley for being so fucking benevolent to, uh, fucking tell Trixie to do her fucking

1485
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
job.

1486
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Yeah.

1487
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
What a, what a base dude.

1488
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Gracious.

1489
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
What a cool guy.

1490
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It's like, oh, well, you know, she doesn't want to do anything for her ex friends.

1491
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And it's like, well, fucking, it's not about fucking any of these guys.

1492
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
It's about the fucking people who paid hundreds of fucking dollars to get this shit.

1493
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
You know, fucking, I am just so sick of their fucking little attitude, man.

1494
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Like when the fuck does Riley feel the fucking need to like talk on her behalf all the time?

1495
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Like just shut the fuck up, Riley.

1496
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Shut the fuck up because nobody fucking cares.

1497
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Anyway, PCP forever.

1498
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Tom will never die.

1499
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Call me back.

1500
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
How do we call him back?

1501
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I couldn't, I couldn't agree more.

1502
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I couldn't agree more and I appreciate it.

1503
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Thanks.

1504
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Thanks for speaking truth to power.

1505
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Thanks for speaking truth to power, friend.

1506
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Yeah.

1507
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Yeah.

1508
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:54,000
It's, for me, it's always, it's always been about like the, the, like the money, the back

1509
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
has spent so much money.

1510
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
We owe it to them to try to get everything that was promised out.

1511
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:06,000
And Trixie has just made it difficult for no discernible reason.

1512
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I mean, I guess you deserve something.

1513
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
The whole, the whole debate about like, oh, I didn't promise the lecture.

1514
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Oh, I didn't technically promise the lecture is like such a, it's missing the point.

1515
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:25,000
The point is that these people cared and they donated and they want something and we have

1516
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:31,000
the opportunity to give them value to, to reward them for their support.

1517
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And, you know, promise or not, Trixie is like nah, and it's despicable.

1518
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
It's the only word for it.

1519
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Whoops.

1520
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Sorry.

1521
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I got a little upset there.

1522
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Ha ha.

1523
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Funny, funny voicemail.

1524
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
You're allowed to get upset.

1525
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:54,000
It's, it's just about the, the, all of the, the like continued, just the disdain of their

1526
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:00,000
movements, just the narcissistic disdain under their stuff because it just rouse you up.

1527
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Just the sheer, just the sheer entitlement of like, ah, fuck you think and I should do

1528
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:11,000
anything just because you cared about my project and supported it and, and pledged to it.

1529
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Now fuck you.

1530
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Like how, how dare you expect anything in return.

1531
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Disgusting.

1532
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Um, next voicemail.

1533
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Levy with no Jevy.

1534
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Okay.

1535
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Three, two, one, go.

1536
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Minor spoilers for us.

1537
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Y'all, please talk about Psycholonials and the ending and what you chose because you

1538
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
haven't really talked about it and talk about how Abby is an amazing character and I love

1539
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:47,000
her because she's an enabler of Zen's bad behavior, self-described and as well as a saviour

1540
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
from it.

1541
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Now that's cool.

1542
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
And, uh, Tommy for there.

1543
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Infinity train season four.

1544
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Speak.

1545
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Uh, you know what?

1546
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I didn't do that.

1547
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I've dropped a Psycholonials thing.

1548
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Yeah, I've dropped the ball because I said that I would let you know when I re-read it

1549
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
and I want, I honestly really want to do it.

1550
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I really want to re-read it and I want to record a Psycholonials cast and I just haven't

1551
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
done it.

1552
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
So it's on me.

1553
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I probably need to re-read at this point because it's been a while.

1554
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I mean, I do love Abby and it's really cool.

1555
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
If I remember correctly, I think, what did I do at the end?

1556
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
There's the two choices.

1557
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I remember what I did at the end.

1558
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Do you want to?

1559
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
I did.

1560
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I forget what the choices were but I know whichever one I pressed, I pressed that every

1561
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
single time.

1562
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Yeah, same.

1563
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
And it was Crown.

1564
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Obviously.

1565
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Wait, no.

1566
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Fuck.

1567
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I forget which is which.

1568
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
It was Dagger.

1569
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Dagger is the sort of thing that's hanging over you.

1570
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Oh, you may never, you'll always have the Dagger hanging over you knowing that you could've

1571
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
been great and you could've done all this stuff.

1572
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I clicked the Dagger over and over again.

1573
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I didn't Crown over and over again.

1574
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yeah.

1575
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I did Crown times five.

1576
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
That's so funny.

1577
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:30,000
It was really cool knowing afterwards where that's the first real point where you can

1578
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:36,000
choose and then the ending of the game happens, the credits roll and you go to the save screen

1579
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:43,000
so you can load up your save and try the different things and it's a completely different thing

1580
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
and it's like the epilogue.

1581
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Like they deleted your save files.

1582
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Actually, you can't just go back and do it again, motherfucker.

1583
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Yeah.

1584
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That was cool.

1585
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
But it tells you like it wouldn't have changed anything.

1586
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
You don't feel like, oh shit, I want to find all the different routes.

1587
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
It's like the routes, they all lead to the same place.

1588
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Don't worry.

1589
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
We deleted your save.

1590
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Don't worry about it.

1591
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Yeah.

1592
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
It's good.

1593
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It was well handled.

1594
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Yeah.

1595
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
No, Crown.

1596
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
You know what?

1597
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I don't want to get too deep into it because I do want to do the Cyclonials cast.

1598
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So I won't explain my reasoning.

1599
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
When we do the Cyclonials cast, I will explain why I did Crown five and you can explain why

1600
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
you did sword five.

1601
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Yeah.

1602
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Hell yeah.

1603
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Do I have time?

1604
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I will try and squeeze out some time soon to do that because it's not long.

1605
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It takes like probably reread it in like four hours.

1606
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Yeah, probably.

1607
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Yeah.

1608
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Okay.

1609
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Was that, was that Levy Jevy that made it?

1610
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
It didn't sound like him.

1611
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
He didn't, it didn't sound like him.

1612
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
So I don't know what.

1613
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
He's got a high pitch voice.

1614
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Yeah.

1615
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I don't think that was him.

1616
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I wonder why it's named after him.

1617
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Shout out to Levy Jevy.

1618
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Yeah.

1619
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Some endless warhead.

1620
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Maybe.

1621
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Endless warhead.

1622
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Like a bomb.

1623
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Like candy.

1624
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Oh.

1625
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Sure.

1626
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Next, next voicemail.

1627
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
There's three voicemails that are called one, two, three.

1628
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So, okay.

1629
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
One in three, two, one, go.

1630
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Hey, there's just me or just a guy of four minutes, 10 seconds of the new Scott the Wilds

1631
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
video look like Nate.

1632
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm a stroke confirm.

1633
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Yeah.

1634
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I don't know.

1635
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Let me go check Scott the was the new Scott the was four minutes and 10 seconds in, but

1636
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
keep in mind, this would have been the new one as of four days ago.

1637
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Okay, let me check.

1638
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Can you screenshot him for me?

1639
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Okay.

1640
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Yeah.

1641
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Four minutes, 10 seconds.

1642
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:12,000
No, no, it fucking doesn't screen screenshot him.

1643
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Oh, um, okay.

1644
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,000
It's just got the it's just got the green lagoon shades on.

1645
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Is that the boundary break guy?

1646
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
God, I hate that guy.

1647
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I mean, I don't hate that guy, but it is content annoys me or at least it used to who's who's

1648
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Scott.

1649
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
No, no, no, boundary break.

1650
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I've never heard of him.

1651
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Yeah, it's he does these videos where this guy does not look like Nate.

1652
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Absolutely.

1653
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:46,000
No, I don't see it at all.

1654
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
He does these videos where he goes beyond the camera in video games, like, oh, he'll

1655
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
he'll like move the camera to places where it was impossible to see.

1656
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
And then you can see like, oh, this is how the background is.

1657
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And this is how like it looks from this angle that is impossible to get to.

1658
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
It's not interesting.

1659
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:12,000
But the way he utilizes this incredible cool technology is terribly, terribly lacking.

1660
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
And I'm so frustrated every time I see any of those things.

1661
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I'm like, oh, I want to know what is in, you know, the boundary breaking of this place,

1662
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
of this game.

1663
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Oh, it's it just leaves me upset that this video exists more or so than like if I never

1664
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
knew because now I just want the technology.

1665
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I don't care about his YouTube channel at all.

1666
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Oh, wait.

1667
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
This is the guy.

1668
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I think I know.

1669
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I think I've seen one or two of those.

1670
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
The ones that just kind of show the game from like angles that you can't see it from

1671
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
regularly.

1672
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Yeah.

1673
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I've seen one of those about about Simpson's fucking road rage.

1674
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I think.

1675
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I think.

1676
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Yeah.

1677
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I don't know.

1678
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I've only seen a few, but like it's, it would just, it would just annoyed me.

1679
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
This guy.

1680
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:09,000
It gives me that Arlo feeling where I feel like Arlo could be so much more than he is

1681
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
with his puppet, but he's just a guy talking.

1682
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,000
He's just a gamer talking about video games in a very dry, normal way.

1683
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
But he's got a funny puppet and he's not funny.

1684
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
He's not a funny person.

1685
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
He's not particularly funny.

1686
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Yeah.

1687
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Yeah.

1688
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
It's missed.

1689
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
It's missed opportunities, lacking, lost potential.

1690
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
That's what annoys me.

1691
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Arlo is fine as a person.

1692
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
This guy does not look like Nate, but some people recently were posting around pictures

1693
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,000
from a wired video called mortician answers dead body questions from Twitter.

1694
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I think I saw that.

1695
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
And, and people posted the screenshot and I checked out the video.

1696
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
People were saying this guy looks like Nate and I honestly, I completely see it.

1697
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Yeah.

1698
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
This guy looks like it.

1699
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Not exactly, but this guy looks a lot like Nate.

1700
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I'm posting the screenshot.

1701
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Wow.

1702
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Why is it?

1703
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Why is it taking so long to upload?

1704
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Jesus Christ.

1705
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
It's only half a, half a megabyte.

1706
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
You fucking, you fucking bitch.

1707
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Processing.

1708
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
There we go.

1709
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:17,000
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like if, if, if Nate and Dr. Wolf fused and he

1710
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
gained the waistcoat.

1711
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Yeah.

1712
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
He's got, he's kind of got like the haircut.

1713
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,000
His, his lips are maybe a little different, but he's kind of got like the face shape and

1714
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
the cut.

1715
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And you know, he does not wear in the sunglasses, but yeah.

1716
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
It's, it's a little like, I totally see it.

1717
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Yeah.

1718
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
It's an interesting video.

1719
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I watched it.

1720
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Just in case people aren't aware because we never talk about it, but we have show notes

1721
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
where you can see the images if they're not on screen.

1722
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Oh, that's right.

1723
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I hope Eleazar still does those.

1724
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Yeah.

1725
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I know.

1726
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I never watched the PCP.

1727
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I have no idea, but if you wanted to know.

1728
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I mean, I would, I would hope for, if it's just an image, I would hope that Eleazar shows

1729
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,000
it on screen, but if it's something like a link, then yeah, show notes should be in the

1730
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,000
description at the timestamp that we talk about the thing.

1731
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Yeah.

1732
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Right.

1733
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
For an image or just show it.

1734
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Right.

1735
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Yeah.

1736
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I think so.

1737
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I think so.

1738
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Yeah.

1739
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Okay.

1740
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
All the, maybe I don't know, I'm fucking in the show notes, maybe put the link to the

1741
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
video.

1742
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,500
But I mean, I said what is, you can just Google mortician answers dead body questions from

1743
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:29,500
Twitter.

1744
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,000
There's only one.

1745
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Whatever.

1746
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Okay.

1747
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Right.

1748
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Enough.

1749
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Yeah.

1750
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Two, three, two, one.

1751
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Go.

1752
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Okay.

1753
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So I continue watching the video.

1754
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
There's a guy in the bottom corner.

1755
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Four minutes, 37 seconds look like monkey to anyone.

1756
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
All right.

1757
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Let me check.

1758
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Oh my God.

1759
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
47 seconds.

1760
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I thought he said four minutes and 30 seconds.

1761
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Let me let me listen again.

1762
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:13,000
He kind of slurs it.

1763
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
It's like, I think he says like four minutes, 30 sec.

1764
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Okay.

1765
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So I think he's saying four minutes, 30 seconds guy in the bottom corner.

1766
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Oh, four minutes, 36 seconds.

1767
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I don't see any monkey.

1768
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Oh, and 47 seconds is a different group of people.

1769
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Also none look like monkey.

1770
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
What is this?

1771
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Why is this guy like live watching Scott the was and making the first one?

1772
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I don't know.

1773
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Okay.

1774
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
You want to do the next one?

1775
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Yeah.

1776
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Okay.

1777
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Next one is called three, three, two, one go.

1778
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Okay.

1779
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So like, I kept watching and I'm stuck with the guy at four minutes and 50 seconds for

1780
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Quentin reviews.

1781
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:00,000
It looks really like Quentin reviews is fucked up.

1782
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
That's so fucked up, dude.

1783
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
That's so messed up.

1784
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I can't believe this shit.

1785
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Stupid.

1786
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Fuck you.

1787
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Yes.

1788
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
The Quentin reviews is there.

1789
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh, is it just actually Quentin?

1790
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Yeah, I think so.

1791
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
But it wasn't at 450.

1792
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
It was at 448.

1793
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh dear.

1794
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Well, you fucked up.

1795
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Okay.

1796
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
The next voicemail is called battle pass.

1797
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
You ready?

1798
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Yep.

1799
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Three, two, one go.

1800
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Okay.

1801
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I kept watching again and the guy at four minutes and 50 sec seconds looks kind of like

1802
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Ben.

1803
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Are you okay?

1804
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Four minutes, 56 seconds.

1805
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Here we go.

1806
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Jesus.

1807
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
You know?

1808
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Worst hairline.

1809
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Did you get one?

1810
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Worst hairline, but I mean you've been judged.

1811
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Show me.

1812
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Show me.

1813
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Show me.

1814
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Worst hairline than mine looks like.

1815
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Oh yeah.

1816
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
I don't know what he's doing.

1817
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yeah, I do kind of see it a little bit.

1818
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
A little bit.

1819
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
He kind of looks like Nathan Fielder.

1820
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
A little bit, but like.

1821
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Oh yeah.

1822
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
This guy's hair is bad.

1823
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
This guy's doing something wrong with it.

1824
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
It's unfortunate.

1825
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Mm-hmm.

1826
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Okay.

1827
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Whatever.

1828
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Next voicemail is called Ginesse.

1829
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
It's Ginesse.

1830
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Okay.

1831
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Three, two, one go.

1832
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Hey Ben Stain.

1833
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I'm in the middle of grinding out my art skills.

1834
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:43,000
And I want to hear about how you load up your art so that you could live off your web

1835
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
comics.

1836
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
How'd you do it, Ben?

1837
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Um, I.

1838
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Oh God.

1839
02:17:53,000 --> 02:18:01,000
You know, it's been so long since I even gave a fuck about living about art or living.

1840
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Um, I leveled up my, I mean, I used to be like kind of.

1841
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I'll tell you exactly what it is.

1842
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I watched a bunch of tutorials.

1843
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
I used to watch a bunch of psychrotutorials.

1844
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I watched a bunch of those and then I would try and like follow along.

1845
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I, I looked up like fundamental exercises, like drawing lots of circles, drawing lots

1846
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
of straight lines.

1847
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I did that for a while.

1848
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Um, not for that long.

1849
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Mostly I just, um, wait, uh, okay.

1850
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Psychra, psychrotutorials, fundamental exercises.

1851
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Uh, there was more.

1852
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Um, uh, oh, Loomis.

1853
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
The Loomis books are so good.

1854
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Uh, drawing the head in hands, uh, figure drawing for all it's worth.

1855
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Um, uh, what, there's, there's another one that I read.

1856
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Uh, I don't know.

1857
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
All the Loomis books are really good.

1858
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
That guy's super good.

1859
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Read Loomis if you haven't.

1860
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Like absolutely read Loomis and follow along.

1861
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I think it was figure drawing for all it's worth.

1862
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Like I followed along and I did all like the exercises that he was talking about.

1863
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Like drawing, like copying the, the, like, you know, the figure of a human off his like,

1864
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
you know, six, six heads tall figure in the fucking like Leonardo da Vinci,

1865
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
like guy spread eagle diagram.

1866
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Um, that was very tedious, but I got a lot out of that book.

1867
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Um, and then the, the, I did all that shit.

1868
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And I would, I would draw them and I would draw like characters faces.

1869
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I would draw characters portraits, you know, just fuck around, fuck or try it with water color,

1870
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
try it with ink, try it in pencil, try it in whatever.

1871
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Uh, try it digitally.

1872
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And then, you know, do all that practice it in various mediums just to see what happens.

1873
02:19:50,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And then finally, I think the, the, the, the, the, the apotheosis of my journey,

1874
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:06,000
my art journey was when I was just like, I'm just going to draw a comic.

1875
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
I'm just going to draw the vapors and it doesn't matter if I'm not good enough.

1876
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I'm just going to keep doing it over and over.

1877
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I'm just going to draw the, redraw the panels until they look right.

1878
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
However long it takes.

1879
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And that's what I did.

1880
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And it took me like six months and eventually it looked kind of good.

1881
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
And that's it.

1882
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Yeah.

1883
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
That's, that's a good mindset to like, to do it until it looks good.

1884
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I always think of like the, the big picture of, oh, my life.

1885
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Like I have to get something done by the end of the year.

1886
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
It's like, I got to do this in certain amount of months because I don't want to be doing

1887
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
nothing.

1888
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I want to be doing something quickly.

1889
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And then I just doesn't end up happening at all.

1890
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,000
No, or if it does get on, end up happening, it's like sort of rushed.

1891
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I would sit, I would sit down and like kind of a plot out the page be like, okay,

1892
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
panel here, panel here, panel here.

1893
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And then I would just go from panel to panel and you know, I would do a sketch and I would

1894
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,000
just, just keep erasing and resketching until the sketch looked good.

1895
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
And then later I came back and I saw the sketches that I had, you know, just done over and over

1896
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
until they looked good.

1897
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
And I was like, okay, time for line work.

1898
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
And I would just do the line work over and over again.

1899
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Sometimes I would get it on the first try and be like, yeah, it looks good.

1900
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Other times it'd be like, that looks bad.

1901
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Erase, do it over again.

1902
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Just do it over again.

1903
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Just do it over again.

1904
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:35,000
And that's, that was the most practice I got was just drawing the vapors and just not

1905
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
giving up until I was satisfied with how it looked.

1906
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I don't know.

1907
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I feel like, I feel like it worked out well for me.

1908
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Maybe not everyone would have success with that method, but it, it, I'm just built different.

1909
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I'm just built different baby.

1910
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
No vaccine side effects.

1911
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Pfizer gang.

1912
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Uh, Pfizer gang is, Pfizer is like Ravenclaw.

1913
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Johnson and Johnson is like Hufflepuff.

1914
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
And the other one, they're like the other two.

1915
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
And the Corona virus is like Slytherin.

1916
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:12,000
The Corona virus is like Voldemort.

1917
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:22,000
No, Corona, transphobia is like, is like the Corona virus in that it permeates everything

1918
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
and is, is deeply into it.

1919
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
And the vaccines do nothing.

1920
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Yes.

1921
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Exactly.

1922
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
That's right.

1923
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
That's right.

1924
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
The metaphor works even better than I expected.

1925
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Next voicemail.

1926
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Eleazar is a bad man.

1927
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Three, two, one, go.

1928
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Like Eleazar.

1929
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Ha!

1930
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
More like Smellyazar.

1931
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah.

1932
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
In my right scoot.

1933
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Kill him.

1934
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Right.

1935
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Right.

1936
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Raggy.

1937
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Smells like shit.

1938
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Raggy.

1939
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
That sounds like, that's what he sounds like, right?

1940
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
No.

1941
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Uh, yeah.

1942
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Err.

1943
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Err.

1944
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm Scooby-Doo.

1945
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Raggy.

1946
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I, I think Eleazar smells like shit, but I'm a dog, so I like how shit smells.

1947
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
So it's a compliment.

1948
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Rooby-Doo-Bee.

1949
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Perfect.

1950
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Rooby-Doo-Bee.

1951
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Thanks for the voicemail.

1952
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
You fucking asshole.

1953
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Next one is called comics.

1954
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Three, two, one, go.

1955
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Hey, PCP.

1956
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Monotone Jones here.

1957
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
No relation.

1958
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Ben, I know you've mentioned this in the past, and I think Gib has as well, but I was wondering

1959
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:37,000
if y'all could talk a bit more about how you feel like there's no point in drawing unless you're making comics.

1960
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I'm curious because I'm the exact opposite.

1961
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Although I have an interest in making comics, the only thing I can motivate slash find enjoyment in is simple illustrations.

1962
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I don't really have a specific question about this, but I thought it would be interesting to hear a bit more about your thought process, I guess.

1963
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Thanks.

1964
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Also, Simsie for full-time PCP.

1965
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,000
It felt like they had been there all along when you had them on.

1966
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Simsie's cool.

1967
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Simsie's cool.

1968
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
But no, no, no PCP ever.

1969
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Never, never, never, never.

1970
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,000
We're gonna dwindle until we're zero people, and the show will go on even then.

1971
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
The only one left will be Craig.

1972
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

1973
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I, I think, I feel like I have two feelings about this, and I think one is mercenary and the other is artistic.

1974
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,000
But both of these instincts are in agreement.

1975
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:39,000
My artistic feeling is that a comic that has a story is just, has a beginning, middle, and an end.

1976
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
It's just inherently more valuable than just like a nice looking image.

1977
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
A nice looking image is transient.

1978
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It, like, what does it mean?

1979
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I don't know.

1980
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
It just is what it is.

1981
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
It looks nice.

1982
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Whatever.

1983
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,000
A comic with a story is like, there's just more to it.

1984
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
It has more, it has context.

1985
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Like, what is, it is a series of drawings, but the series of drawings mutually reinforce one another in that they come together to be more than the sum of their parts and that they tell a narrative.

1986
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:18,000
And from a more cynical mercenary perspective, you can sell a comic and you can't, I mean, I guess you can sell a print of an illustration.

1987
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
You can be an illustrator.

1988
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I guess you're right.

1989
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I guess you're right.

1990
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I just, I don't know.

1991
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
She's an illustrator.

1992
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,000
She gets work.

1993
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
She, she gets work.

1994
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Uh, yeah.

1995
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1996
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
But I don't, but I, but I didn't, but I don't want to do that.

1997
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Like, I don't want to like have people commissioning me to like draw a character or draw a scene.

1998
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I just don't, I, yeah, I guess you're right.

1999
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I'm wrong.

2000
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
You can just sell that.

2001
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I just, I just didn't want to.

2002
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,000
So I was like, I'm going to do this other thing and sell that probably cause I don't know.

2003
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I don't know.

2004
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Whatever.

2005
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
That's my answer.

2006
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
What's, what's your answer?

2007
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
My answer is, is similarly two fold.

2008
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:13,000
First one is that much in the same way that I tried to learn animation or I did learn animation.

2009
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I was going to university for that.

2010
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Um, I can't draw very well, but if you put a bunch of images in sequence, people don't notice.

2011
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Uh, so a comic, a comic use your eyes glaze over the shit panels and then you focus on the cool ones.

2012
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And then animation, you don't notice the bad frames because the cool frames, they only last for a fraction of a second.

2013
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:48,000
So it's like, I, I like, but I can hide, I can hide my, my bad, uh, technique through motion.

2014
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Uh, that's why I like an animation and comics cause it's the same sort of thing.

2015
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Your eyes are moving.

2016
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
There's something, there's always somewhere to be for your eyes.

2017
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
You're like always going to the next part and it's a story.

2018
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,000
So you're, you obviously want to continually experience the narrative.

2019
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
You want to see what happens next.

2020
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
So you don't linger on anything.

2021
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Um, and the other reason is I, I find it, uh, very satisfying to make a story that has multiple layers of, of interest.

2022
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Uh, multiple layers of intrigue for the reader.

2023
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Uh, with an image, you could be saying lots of things.

2024
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I think if, if I think of like the coolest type of image, if I were to be an illustrator, it would probably be like a Where's Wally or a Where's, uh, Waldo, like huge image with so many things going on.

2025
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Um, that you, you know, you've got so much to look at.

2026
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Have you ever read Kill Six Billion Demons?

2027
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
The what?

2028
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
There's a comic called Kill Six Billion Demons.

2029
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:10,000
And if you like like Where's Waldo style, like big, like images of a scene with like lots of little shit coming.

2030
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Kill Six Billion Demons, it takes place in like the outer planes and like the hell and heaven and stuff.

2031
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And sometimes he will, I forget what the name of the author is, but he will do big, like huge shots that show like a whole landscape.

2032
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:31,000
And the landscape will be some like hell plane that's like made of like giant bones.

2033
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:38,000
And like there's like cutaways that like you can see inside of like the bones that have been cut in half to make like apartments in.

2034
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And you can see into all these like demon apartments built inside of like bones that are jutting out of some like magma cliff.

2035
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:51,000
And you can see all the little, all like the weird like monsters and spirits and stuff that are all just kind of doing shit.

2036
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Sort of like a Where's Waldo where it's like people walking around and it's like packed with things.

2037
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
It's very cool.

2038
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
And it's in that kind of spirit.

2039
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Anyway, what about it?

2040
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Well, yeah, I just I like when I when I think of like, like a painting or something.

2041
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Yeah, the you can look at a painting in an art gallery or like his decoration for a house.

2042
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And it's yeah, my eye glosses over it.

2043
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Most of the time if it's like something simple, if it's really nice, it's really nice.

2044
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Like I like to put really nice images on.

2045
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
It doesn't have to be like a landscape or anything, just like an illustration.

2046
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I like to put stuff like that in background things like posters on my wall, desktop wallpapers, phone screen, lock screen backgrounds.

2047
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:58,000
That's what I think of illustration as being like useful for is like in the background to give just a, you know, out of the corner of your eye something nice to look at.

2048
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:04,000
But it's never really something you pay attention to or study unless it's extremely complex.

2049
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Yeah.

2050
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And so comics are it's just it's so complex.

2051
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
There's so it's so dense.

2052
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,000
There's so many things going on.

2053
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
That's why I like comics.

2054
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:22,000
What do you what do you think about kind of that's why I like making them, I guess, not necessarily why I like reading them.

2055
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,000
There's there's a thing because I have things I want to communicate.

2056
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:38,000
That's that's the reason there's a thing that is kind of like both of those things combined and the example that spring to mind and I know that this didn't like invent the technique.

2057
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:49,000
But I remember there is one of these things in the My Little Pony friendship is magic, like comic, the Big Mac episode.

2058
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:54,000
There is sort of like a where's Waldo like big shot of like Ponyville.

2059
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Oh, yeah.

2060
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I love the arts in those comics.

2061
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
A lot of them had really good art.

2062
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Oh, who was the.

2063
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:07,000
There was one pair of artists and writer who was the best one.

2064
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Price Andy Price.

2065
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I think was the artist I really liked.

2066
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:24,000
But I don't think he drew the Big Mac one, although I kind of forget, but there's a big like panned out shot of like it's not all a Ponyville, but it's like a big chunk of Ponyville and you see Big Mac going from like house to house.

2067
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:34,000
And like talking to all these people and like having a different interaction with all these different characters and it is sort of like a big scenery shot where you see all these people doing different things.

2068
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:46,000
But also it's a sequential scene or telling a story of like, this is like a series of places and interactions like Big Mac went here and he talked to this person and then he went here and he talked to this person.

2069
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:52,000
And then he went here and he did this and he went to that store and he bought that and then he went here and he used the thing he bought to do the thing.

2070
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:57,000
And then he went there and the person said don't do this and da da da da.

2071
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And that's pretty neat.

2072
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:03,000
And I like it.

2073
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Yeah, I googled the. I remember reading that. That was a really.

2074
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Yeah, I know this.

2075
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That's just the first one that's bring I know I'm I've seen it in other places too. But yeah,

2076
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:28,000
These comics I should have got into more because it's really like it's the sort of thing that when I was young I was I was really into the Simpsons comics and I've read a lot of those.

2077
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I never had I never read those.

2078
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
If I had some of them are really good.

2079
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
If I had had them extremely good.

2080
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:40,000
If I had had access to them if I had known anywhere that sold them I would have been all over them.

2081
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I just I didn't know that there were Simpsons comics or like I never saw them anywhere.

2082
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:52,000
But that would have been right up my alley who boy when I was like a really little kid.

2083
02:32:52,000 --> 02:33:00,000
I made I drew some comics like you know like garbage ones that like a fucking kindergartner would draw.

2084
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And I this is I don't know if I've ever mentioned this but I tried to draw a like.

2085
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I thought it would be cool or something to show like Homer Simpson like fighting all these like monsters from Greek mythology.

2086
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I thought that was cool.

2087
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:30,000
And you know I just watched I think it you I've been I've fucking let YouTube auto play fucking videos where a guy talks about video games.

2088
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
And I let it do that and I started listening.

2089
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I was listening to some videos.

2090
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I think the guy's name is Sivi and he had a video about die katana.

2091
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:46,000
You know the famously bad follow up to quake I think.

2092
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:57,000
And the plot of die katana is basically you go to like all these different places in history and you fight these mythological monsters.

2093
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:09,000
And all I could think about was I hate this I drew this I told this story when I was in kindergarten about Homer Simpson.

2094
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Homer Simpson Homer Simpson climbed the fucking Mount Olympus to fucking slay Medusa or whatever.

2095
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
What does what is this.

2096
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
No I'm sure it doesn't exist.

2097
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:28,000
If it does I'm sure it's in a fucking in a file folder in a box somewhere in my parents basement.

2098
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
No I've that would be so embarrassing.

2099
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I hope I never see that.

2100
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
I want to see it.

2101
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
I know I love I love shitty things done when young.

2102
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Those are cool.

2103
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,000
I hope I hope to God that it's been destroyed.

2104
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I couldn't bear it.

2105
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,000
My heart couldn't take it.

2106
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Fuck comics.

2107
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Am I right.

2108
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Next.

2109
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Yes.

2110
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Voice mail.

2111
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Yes.

2112
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Yes.

2113
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Yes.

2114
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Yes.

2115
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Yes.

2116
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Yes.

2117
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Yes.

2118
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Yes.

2119
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Yes.

2120
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Listen to your voice mail of mine and let you know that my own lecture Stargate 101 is live now and we have two more in editing.

2121
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Stargate on this summer.

2122
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Took four weeks.

2123
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:19,000
From the day it was recorded to the day it was released.

2124
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,000
I know you'll do better next time.

2125
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Speaking of which give please promise.

2126
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Fuck you.

2127
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Do a lecture on Buffy and Angels someday those shows are a ton of fun and would make a great topic.

2128
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
That you know maybe I I think.

2129
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,000
It's always come up as like a what makes a good lecture.

2130
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:44,000
I feel like Buffy and Angel are such good, like unironically good shows of television

2131
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:51,000
that it is a waste to explain the plot in a lecture in the same way that it would be.

2132
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
That's kind of how I feel about Tales Get Strolled.

2133
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Yeah, I mean a little bit.

2134
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Tales Get Strolled is an experience you want to have.

2135
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Sonichu is not necessarily, it's hard to sit through that.

2136
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
You think people would be better off just watching Buffy?

2137
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
They would, it's really good.

2138
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:25,000
It's very 90s and it's a lot better than maybe people assume it is for being a show about a girl killing vampires.

2139
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I mean I've said it's praises before.

2140
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Do you watch Jenny Nicholson?

2141
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
On occasion she comes up in my recommended and sometimes, yeah.

2142
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I think her latest video, I think it's her latest one about the vampire diaries.

2143
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:49,000
It's very good, it's not a lecture but it is her just talking about a show in kind of the same way.

2144
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,000
It's sort of similar in concept and I like it a lot.

2145
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:55,000
I think it's very entertaining.

2146
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I like her stuff.

2147
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:03,000
It's funny, it's funny the jokes that she makes about it.

2148
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I don't know.

2149
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:11,000
If she made one just like it about Buffy, I'd be like, yep, I'll watch that.

2150
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Because I'm never going to watch Buffy or Angel.

2151
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
So I mean if someone made a lecture about it, I'd be like, yeah, listen to that.

2152
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Well, would you then go and watch it afterwards?

2153
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Doubtful.

2154
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Yeah, you know, I think a lot of the fun is the twists and turns that you experience as you watch.

2155
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I feel like knowing the plot beforehand is not the same.

2156
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
It's not the same thing.

2157
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,000
It's like maybe the lecture might convince me that oh this is actually good,

2158
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:51,000
but then having watched the lecture, I would be like, well, I already know.

2159
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
So why do I need to watch it?

2160
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Even if I am convinced that it's good.

2161
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:59,000
It's like watching, I guess it's not.

2162
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,000
It wouldn't be as bad as the one piece.

2163
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,000
It wouldn't be as okay as the one piece lecture because one piece has so much stuff that is difficult to remember.

2164
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:11,000
It's just somewhat like understandable as a lecture topic.

2165
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Buffy is not that complicated.

2166
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
You can get everything.

2167
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I mean, that's part of the appeal, though, of the lecture is that if you're not going to watch something,

2168
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,000
like I'm never going to watch Buffy, if I hear someone explain the plot of Buffy,

2169
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:33,000
I can still kind of get and appreciate an unexpected twist,

2170
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,000
just in a sort of boiled down, summarized version.

2171
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I can still get that build up where you explain, this happens, this happens, this happens,

2172
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
but then, aha, it was like this all along.

2173
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,000
And then I go, oh, no.

2174
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:52,000
There would be a few moments like that.

2175
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Maybe.

2176
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I'm still not done with it.

2177
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Like last season of Buffy right now, second to last season of Angel.

2178
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
It's good.

2179
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,000
That's all I can say at the moment.

2180
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
By the way, I said it was very 90s.

2181
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
That's kind of misleading.

2182
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:20,000
It's very 90s in that it has like grunge for like the theme song.

2183
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
And it took place in the 90s.

2184
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
It was filmed in the late 90s, but it is not like 90s core.

2185
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
It is very like timeless storytelling.

2186
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
It just happens to take place in a time where certain things were fashionable.

2187
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Yeah, sure.

2188
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Fair.

2189
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:47,000
It's a period piece, or maybe not.

2190
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:51,000
It's universally understood all of the things that are going on,

2191
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:58,000
like the vampires are window dressing and the 90s is just happenstance.

2192
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Fair enough.

2193
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Next voicemail is called Based Joker 10.

2194
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Three, two, one, go.

2195
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:12,000
You know, when I tell people that I snuck some pistachios into their salad,

2196
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:16,000
they say, oh, that really adds some flavor.

2197
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:17,000
What?

2198
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:21,000
But when I tell people that I snuck some poop stashios into their salad,

2199
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:26,000
well, suddenly I'm no longer a contestant on MasterChef.

2200
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,000
That's pretty good.

2201
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Yeah, that's pretty good.

2202
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,000
It says, God, I'm chuckling.

2203
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I'm chuckling cross.

2204
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I think poop stashios.

2205
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
It's not your best, but it's not your worst.

2206
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Poop stashios was a bit over, like, I don't know, if it was obvious

2207
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:53,000
or just sort of single layer to it.

2208
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:56,000
The MasterChef bit made it a little funnier.

2209
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:01,000
The MasterChef bit, the high degree of specificity of the situation

2210
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,000
revealed was like, yeah, OK.

2211
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I think the perfect Based Joker joke would read like a drill tweet

2212
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:16,000
in the way that a really good drill tweet is not just a very simple

2213
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
one note joke that you can see coming.

2214
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:25,000
It's the words used, like, only after you have finished reading it,

2215
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:30,000
do you come to realize that it wasn't just that one thing that was strange.

2216
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,000
It was all of these other things.

2217
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And then that makes it funnier afterwards.

2218
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Yes.

2219
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
You know what I mean?

2220
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Yes.

2221
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I think I do know what you mean.

2222
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,000
It's like a sleeper agent, like a word you weren't really thinking about

2223
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
in another context afterwards.

2224
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,000
It's like, wait, that's even stupider than I thought it was.

2225
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2226
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,000
The sudden imparting of new meaning through context

2227
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:03,000
to something that was previously thought to be understood.

2228
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:11,000
The thing that's got explaining jokes is just makes them so much funnier.

2229
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
It's the best thing to do.

2230
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Yeah.

2231
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,000
OK, next voicemail is called Dead People.

2232
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Three, two, one, go.

2233
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,000
You know, I'm watching the PCP right now and I had this thought.

2234
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Those are real graves, you know, that you edit the faces onto.

2235
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Who do you think is under there?

2236
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Who is Harold Henry?

2237
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Did Harold Henry know that when he died, somebody would get like a stock photograph

2238
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:50,000
of his grave and put him on a shitty podcast that's like full of washed up content creators

2239
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
that used to be spicy.

2240
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Bold of you.

2241
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Bold of you just claimed that I used to be something.

2242
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Yeah, the people who are the washed up somebodies aren't on the podcast.

2243
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
They're dead.

2244
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
They're under the ground.

2245
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Talk about someone who used to be somebody.

2246
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Put him in a fucking corpse.

2247
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Shit, man.

2248
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
I don't know.

2249
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I just fucking googled and found a stock image of a graveyard with a bunch of headstones on it.

2250
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Well, you didn't think about it, Ben.

2251
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Now we've desecrated all of these graves over and over again for weeks.

2252
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I didn't.

2253
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I don't know whose graves these are and does it matter?

2254
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I don't know.

2255
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Do you care about this?

2256
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I don't think I care about this.

2257
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I guess I wouldn't care until somebody who's a relative of one of the gravestones complained

2258
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,000
and then it would be like, yeah, I guess we should.

2259
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
You just just draw a picture.

2260
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
I mean, let's see.

2261
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Harold Henry.

2262
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Let's see.

2263
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
When did he perish?

2264
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
When did these people...

2265
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:59,000
I mean, I'm assuming these are like old graves?

2266
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I can't really read the...

2267
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Old dead people are old, Ben.

2268
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I can't really read the numbers.

2269
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Yeah.

2270
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I don't know.

2271
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Are these like 100 years old?

2272
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Maybe nobody who even knew these people...

2273
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:17,000
100 years old graves would look a lot worse than that.

2274
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Do you think so?

2275
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
I mean, it's stone.

2276
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Inference.

2277
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:28,000
A lot of these have their coloring entirely worn off and they're just like...

2278
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Yeah, I guess they're completely white.

2279
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:37,000
When I go around English graveyards, they're a lot more fucked up because it rains more, I guess.

2280
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Also, people have been making graveyards there for longer.

2281
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:47,000
The graveyards in England just are older than the ones here.

2282
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Sure, but the individual tombstones not necessarily super old.

2283
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Sometimes it could just be like 50 years and it still looks like it's been there for like 700 years or whatever.

2284
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Sure.

2285
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Well, I don't know.

2286
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Caller, if you're offended, I'm sorry that you're offended.

2287
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Okay, next one.

2288
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Next one is called Henlo Corgo 3.

2289
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Fuck you, Ben Taint.

2290
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2291
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Hey, Ben.

2292
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:31,000
So, like, how many times do people, including yourself, have to tell you to quit assuming gender?

2293
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:37,000
You know, like of people who call in and leave voicemails or in any other situation, really, but...

2294
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Right.

2295
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I was really excited to hear your guys' reaction to my voicemail last week.

2296
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Did I fuck it up?

2297
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
It was a pretty good reaction, yeah, I'll give you that.

2298
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I got mostly the desired effect, but then you also had to be cringe.

2299
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:00,000
You woke up that morning, took a big, big deep breath of fresh air and said,

2300
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I'm just going to be a massive fucking troglodyte ass hat today.

2301
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I...

2302
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Fuck you, Ben.

2303
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Get better at being better and quit being cringe.

2304
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
I guess I assume...

2305
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Wow.

2306
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
You're gender and I apologize.

2307
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I do it.

2308
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:25,000
I assume male a lot.

2309
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I apologize.

2310
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I'm sorry.

2311
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I didn't have done...

2312
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Didn't have done it.

2313
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I don't know what else to say.

2314
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Okay, whoops.

2315
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I mean, I didn't catch you, but...

2316
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
God, I must have done that as well.

2317
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I'm sure I've done it a lot.

2318
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I'm sure I've done it many times and...

2319
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I don't know.

2320
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I'm not proud of myself.

2321
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Sorry.

2322
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Whoops.

2323
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Okay, next one is called Another L for the Old Benny Santos.

2324
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Wait, do you see this one?

2325
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Refresh the second page.

2326
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
It's moved down into the...

2327
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Another L for the Old Benny Santos.

2328
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2329
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,000
I made it simple for you, Ben.

2330
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I gave you the key to avoiding harm and yet here we are.

2331
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
You took another L.

2332
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:27,000
You misgendered someone after I told you to use the

2333
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:30,000
a simple gender neutral pronoun

2334
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,000
for your audience of many, many trans people.

2335
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I'm sorry.

2336
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
I didn't listen to you.

2337
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
You wanted to create a safe space for trans people.

2338
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Christ.

2339
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I let it slide when someone put their pronouns

2340
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
in the title of their voicemail

2341
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
and yet you still ignored it.

2342
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
But this has been brought to my direct attention.

2343
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Tell to what extent these two are taking the piss.

2344
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I can't either.

2345
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:01,000
I think they were in your discord talking about it though.

2346
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:05,000
So I think they're serious, but they were sounding very jokey.

2347
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:10,000
They weren't actually that upset, but they did want you to say they.

2348
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
So it's not untrue that what they're saying.

2349
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
It's not untrue.

2350
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,000
I'm, I'm, I'm going to assume this is whatever.

2351
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Whoops.

2352
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I fucked up.

2353
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,000
I'm just going to assume no one's actually mad at me because

2354
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,000
it's easier to live like that.

2355
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Uh, sorry.

2356
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Sorry.

2357
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Beefed it.

2358
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Next one is called the monopoly man.

2359
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Three, two, one, go.

2360
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

2361
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Here's the monopoly man.

2362
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:47,000
I'm calling in to say that the guy who said that the fixed money

2363
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,000
supply of Bitcoin is its downfall is wrong.

2364
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:57,000
You see, when you have money that you can inflate people that are

2365
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:02,000
closer to the government, get the money, which means it's kind

2366
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:06,000
of like a social point system like in China.

2367
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:11,000
It's not about how much value you give back to society with

2368
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
your investments.

2369
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:18,000
So I guess what I'm saying is that the monopoly man is actually

2370
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
good.

2371
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

2372
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Who would have slurred those hose together?

2373
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Who would have, I'm always slurring hoes.

2374
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
You know what I mean?

2375
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Who would have thought the monopoly man, the monopoly man is very

2376
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
concerned.

2377
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
He's worried about the little guy.

2378
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:50,000
uh, uh, having their, uh, their diversely invested portfolio be devalued, uh, that would just be a real problem, you know, for the working class.

2379
02:49:50,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Um, your, your thoughts have been imputed, uh, Monopoly Man, uh, vote in your local elections.

2380
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Next one is called Ben Read One Piece, please. Three, two, one, go.

2381
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Hi Ben, you can come live with me.

2382
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Okay.

2383
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Cool.

2384
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Next one is called Molesting Beb, three, two, one, go.

2385
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Okay.

2386
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Next one is called RV Location Found, three, two, one, go.

2387
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:39,000
According to my calculations, VRV is beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, up my ass.

2388
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Why do you, why did you need to do so many calculations to figure that out?

2389
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Yeah, why do you need a computer to tell you that?

2390
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:50,000
And if you already did the calculations, what was the BPD boopin' in?

2391
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:57,000
What, you, he's, he's is a computer. He is a computer. He calculated it live. Why does he even have that?

2392
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:04,000
He says, uh, well, where else are you going to die a rea?

2393
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
From.

2394
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:17,000
On top of a fucking building in front of a bunch of, of a, of a protest, a bunch of, a bunch of gender critical protestors, uh, uh, uh, protesting, uh, free bathrooms.

2395
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Where, where else, it would be a waste to do it anywhere else.

2396
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Uh, I should have an entire RV out on them. One of the steps of Congress.

2397
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:29,000
If, if I can put like a sieve under your ass and it like sprays.

2398
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Oh, like a shower head?

2399
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Turns it to shit rain.

2400
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Like a shower head, yeah.

2401
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
And rains, like increases the, the surface area.

2402
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:37,000
You put it, you, you, shh.

2403
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Like a, like, you know how on the end of like a garden hose, you put like a nozzle and the nozzle has like changeable settings that you twist it.

2404
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:50,000
And it's like, oh, like, like squirt or like shower or soak, right?

2405
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,000
You shove one of those up your ass and you twist it, right?

2406
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,000
For a different set.

2407
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Like, oh, no, I want to concentrate in stream.

2408
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Oh, no.

2409
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,000
J.K. Rowling is opening her mouth.

2410
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Oh, I want to concentrate in stream.

2411
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Point it right down the throat.

2412
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Oh, no.

2413
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Oh, she, she left.

2414
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,000
She, she, she retreated to her armored vehicle and left the scene.

2415
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Okay.

2416
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Time to turn it to shower head and get all her supporters.

2417
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,000
This is the kind of terrorism I can support.

2418
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I'm sorry.

2419
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I'm sorry.

2420
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Ehehe, uh, um, uh, yes, good, good.

2421
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Okay.

2422
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Glad, glad we found it.

2423
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Next one is called Nate Location.

2424
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Found three, two, one.

2425
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Go.

2426
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
According to my calculations.

2427
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Nate is be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be I'm my dick.

2428
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
That was a long one.

2429
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,160
Up my ass. Oh, wow.

2430
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:47,320
Online too.

2431
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:49,760
We got another Natebucker.

2432
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:52,200
We got one.

2433
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:55,160
But he's also an RV being fucked by

2434
02:52:55,800 --> 02:52:58,200
because of RVs in his ass.

2435
02:52:58,200 --> 02:52:59,840
And he's got the RV in his ass.

2436
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,120
He's got Nate on his dick.

2437
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:03,840
This guy is living the dream.

2438
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:06,000
Congrats.

2439
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,080
The dream of having a fucking vehicle in Uranus.

2440
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:10,960
He's got it all.

2441
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:12,960
He's got it all.

2442
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:15,560
I had to hide that RV somewhere,

2443
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:19,080
so I shoved it up your ass without even thinking.

2444
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:20,560
It was it was the

2445
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:22,520
it was just the most convenient place to put it.

2446
02:53:22,520 --> 02:53:23,680
Sorry about that.

2447
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,680
But I'm glad you got to fuck Nate.

2448
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:30,520
Next voicemail is called Slap on the Ballsack

2449
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:35,360
from and chew on your nuts until they crack at dot com.

2450
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:38,280
Three, two, one, go.

2451
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:44,840
Oh, my God.

2452
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:47,200
Thirty five Jesse.

2453
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:53,160
Ha. Oh, no.

2454
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:56,360
Is this the guy from the length CDI Zelda?

2455
02:53:56,360 --> 02:53:58,000
I'm going to suck you on the ball sack.

2456
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:59,920
I'm going to suck you on the ball sack.

2457
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:03,480
I'm going to suck you on the ball sack and 200 knots of cold thick crack.

2458
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:05,640
I'm upset.

2459
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:07,440
I'm going to suck you on the ball sack.

2460
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:10,560
I'm going to suck you on the ball sack and 200 knots of cold.

2461
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:16,080
No more, no more voicemails.

2462
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:22,080
And people say that Jesse left the podcast.

2463
02:54:22,080 --> 02:54:27,680
That's, that's gotta be, that's, no, that's gotta be Oblivionfall, right?

2464
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,400
It's gotta be.

2465
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:30,400
Probably.

2466
02:54:30,400 --> 02:54:33,400
Every time I hear a good voi-, every time I hear a good voicemail, I just assume it's

2467
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,400
Oblivionfall.

2468
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:35,880
It's one person.

2469
02:54:35,880 --> 02:54:37,280
Yeah.

2470
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:44,760
Next one is called Forgib, Professional Advice, Radcon Media Backup Suggestions.

2471
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:45,760
Okay.

2472
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:49,280
Three, two, one, go.

2473
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:57,560
Exposing corruption at the DMD, it should be a national pastime activity.

2474
02:54:57,560 --> 02:55:02,280
There's only one problem with that you see.

2475
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:05,680
They're not doing it intentionally.

2476
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:15,040
Punch cart records and iron ledgers litter the whole facility.

2477
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:24,520
What is there to do but escalate this to a missile to the face of the authorities?

2478
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:38,160
Avoid becoming the DMV, soar all backups on DVDs.

2479
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:42,280
I mean, I mean.

2480
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:44,160
But where's the advice?

2481
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:47,640
I wanted, yeah, where's the professional advice?

2482
02:55:47,640 --> 02:55:51,640
Oh, store it on DVDs.

2483
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:54,280
We shouldn't, we shouldn't have given.

2484
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,040
Oh yeah, I don't know about that one.

2485
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:59,880
I thought they meant like pro-, like here's some fashion tips and I was excited.

2486
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:04,600
Yeah, that one, yeah, didn't deliver on that.

2487
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:07,800
Radcon Media Backup Suggestion put it on DVDs.

2488
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:15,840
That's fair enough, fair enough, what have-, we gotta store-, we gotta put it on Blu-ray.

2489
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:19,160
We gotta burn those Blu-rays and give them to our backers.

2490
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:20,600
I know, I know someone.

2491
02:56:20,680 --> 02:56:22,200
I know someone who can do that.

2492
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:30,800
Next voicemail is called Crypto Talk 321 Go.

2493
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:37,000
Can you please talk about how cryptocurrency is essentially a pyramid scheme?

2494
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:41,720
Like, think about it, could-, Bitcoin doesn't produce anything.

2495
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:43,880
It doesn't provide a service.

2496
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:48,840
There really isn't any demand for it because of the other two things.

2497
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:56,200
So the only thing propping up its value is people buying into it and so it's just cash and credit.

2498
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:00,200
Like, that's all it is.

2499
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:07,080
If the influx of regular cash and credit stops, which it has to because there's only a finite

2500
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:14,840
amount of cash in the world, the whole thing collapses and only the people at the top actually

2501
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:21,480
benefit at all from the value going up and everybody else is just fighting for scraps.

2502
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:24,280
Like, it's a god damn pyramid scheme.

2503
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:27,480
It's a pyramid scheme.

2504
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:28,840
Guys, like, stop.

2505
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:31,480
Stop, stop shilling for cryptos.

2506
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:32,200
It's a pyramid scheme.

2507
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:34,120
I'm not shilling.

2508
02:57:34,120 --> 02:57:34,920
Stop it.

2509
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:35,720
I'm not.

2510
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:36,840
I love you, Ben.

2511
02:57:36,840 --> 02:57:37,640
I love you, Gim.

2512
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:38,440
Okay.

2513
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:40,120
I love you, Tommy, if you dare.

2514
02:57:40,120 --> 02:57:41,320
You'll never die.

2515
02:57:41,320 --> 02:57:41,560
Bye.

2516
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:42,120
Bye.

2517
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:43,240
Bye.

2518
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:46,680
Um, I, oh god, I don't know.

2519
02:57:46,680 --> 02:57:48,760
I feel too stupid about this.

2520
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:55,400
I, I, I agree and also hope that it's true.

2521
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:59,800
I mean, I hate it and it kind of is a pyramid scheme.

2522
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:00,440
I know what you mean.

2523
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:05,160
Yeah, it's just a bunch of people at the top that control the supply making all the money from people

2524
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:07,000
by inflating the demand.

2525
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:08,200
That's true.

2526
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:12,280
But is it, is it so different from just money in general?

2527
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:14,760
Isn't just money also bad?

2528
02:58:15,560 --> 02:58:19,720
So it seems to me that even, even if it's true that it is all a big scam and a pyramid scheme,

2529
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:29,080
that doesn't, that, and I'm sure it is, that doesn't preclude it from also being a functional currency.

2530
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:31,160
I, I do not like Bitcoin.

2531
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:35,400
I am not hoping for it to supplant traditional currency.

2532
02:58:35,400 --> 02:58:37,000
I don't like it enough for that.

2533
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:43,400
Never, that, that doesn't, that doesn't make me think that it's, can't happen though.

2534
02:58:43,400 --> 02:58:45,480
Just the fact that I don't want it to.

2535
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:45,800
All right.

2536
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:48,200
Here's my question then.

2537
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:56,120
Buying and selling crypto comes with a, a fee with every transaction.

2538
02:58:57,080 --> 02:59:00,520
And, um, I mean, not always.

2539
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:05,080
Is there, is, well, basically, if you turn it into real money,

2540
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:08,440
crypto, the crypto can be free sometimes, but like,

2541
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:13,080
if you do it through like a commercial, if you do it through like a commercial vendor or service,

2542
02:59:13,080 --> 02:59:20,040
then yeah, but like, you can do peer to peer like Bitcoin crypto trades that don't have any overhead fees.

2543
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:24,280
But like, if you know how to do that, which I don't.

2544
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:26,680
Uh, well, I don't.

2545
02:59:27,640 --> 02:59:31,800
I'm just saying, is there like an equivalent in like regular currency?

2546
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:39,320
Like, if, if, if this is like a, if it's equivalent and not a pyramid scheme,

2547
02:59:40,360 --> 02:59:48,440
um, then like you lose money every time the market shifts and then you make transactions.

2548
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:55,080
And the people who, you know, the companies that facilitate all those transactions are the ones

2549
02:59:55,080 --> 02:59:55,720
raking it in.

2550
02:59:57,320 --> 03:00:00,840
Um, yeah, is there an equivalent of that in real money?

2551
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:01,880
I think there might be.

2552
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:08,440
Of course, converting between any two currencies carries, you know, conversion fees.

2553
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:10,040
Right, okay.

2554
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:12,840
Um, yeah.

2555
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:14,760
I guess it's just like crypto.

2556
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:20,360
Yeah, I don't know either, whether it's, whether it's like

2557
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:22,840
any different from regular currency.

2558
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:28,280
I see the pyramid scheme thing because like, to people get hype for using the currency of the

2559
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:31,720
country they live in, no, they just use it because they have to.

2560
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:39,400
I mean, there was a, there was a, um, oh God, it was the, the Iraqi Denari.

2561
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:45,480
I think that like Trump was said some stuff about the Iraqi Denari and like Q people thought

2562
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:48,680
that it meant that like the Iraqi Denari was going to skyrocket.

2563
03:00:48,680 --> 03:00:53,080
So a bunch of people, there was a bubble, a bunch of people converted a lot of their

2564
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:58,120
money to Iraqi Denari thinking it was going to be, you know, explode in value due to some kind of

2565
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:00,200
infusion from America.

2566
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:06,200
And yeah, like that's kind of the same.

2567
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:09,160
It's the same thing as, as the crypto bubble.

2568
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:14,440
It's just as much of a bubble, kind of just as much as a pyramid scheme, in which case,

2569
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:18,520
you know, only, you know, certain people that control all the supply at the top benefit and

2570
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:19,720
everyone else gets fucked.

2571
03:01:19,720 --> 03:01:24,280
Yeah, but I mean, the Iraqi Denari is still a real and functional currency.

2572
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:28,520
Uh, I don't want to sound like a Bitcoin supporter.

2573
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:31,800
No, I, I, I just, yeah.

2574
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:37,800
Pyramid scheme is a very specific thing, but there's definitely much to criticize about crypto.

2575
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:45,160
I mean, I kind of think the whole like money in general and just the economy is also a big

2576
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:45,960
pyramid scheme.

2577
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:51,560
So, I mean, yeah, it's, I don't like money.

2578
03:01:51,720 --> 03:01:59,160
It's, yeah, it is all a fucking scam to funnel value up to those in power and away from the

2579
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:00,600
fucking peons at the bottom.

2580
03:02:00,600 --> 03:02:01,880
It's all, it's all that.

2581
03:02:02,600 --> 03:02:09,000
That's just, it's, that's, that's probably an argument for why it will become a widely

2582
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,560
used currency because it is a fucking scam and a pyramid scheme.

2583
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:12,360
It was perfect.

2584
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:13,800
It's ideal.

2585
03:02:15,160 --> 03:02:16,360
And that's why I'm afraid of it.

2586
03:02:16,360 --> 03:02:20,040
Cause like, yeah, it is, if it is up, if it is a perfect store of value with the finite

2587
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:27,320
supply that makes its, that makes its function as a pyramid scheme medium, possibly more

2588
03:02:27,320 --> 03:02:27,800
effective.

2589
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:31,240
Ugh, God nightmare.

2590
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:37,960
Uh, hey, speaking of which, the next voicemail is called capitalism.

2591
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:41,960
Three, two, one, go.

2592
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:49,880
Can I just say, I am so proud of the human race that we have harnessed the incredible

2593
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:58,600
power of math to just reach into the void, the nothingness, and just grab scarcity.

2594
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:00,520
Yes, we made it.

2595
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:02,040
The fucking void theme.

2596
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:08,760
And just like, we, we tricked our monkey brains into looking at these, these.

2597
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:09,720
Time NFTs.

2598
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:17,000
And like, when we put number in, it output big number is random.

2599
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:24,520
But if I look for a very specific type of number, that type of number only appears sometime.

2600
03:03:25,240 --> 03:03:28,440
So we can, we can make money out of this.

2601
03:03:29,240 --> 03:03:30,920
I just, I just think that's beautiful.

2602
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:35,720
Like as, as a human, I truly believe we are all fucking.

2603
03:03:37,080 --> 03:03:40,520
So, uh, yeah, shit sucks.

2604
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:46,680
If everything were abundant, if everything were abundant and everlasting and there

2605
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:57,080
was no scarcity, then nothing would be beautiful because, uh, I don't know, contrast.

2606
03:03:57,080 --> 03:03:59,240
Uh, because, uh, the sublime-

2607
03:03:59,240 --> 03:04:00,680
Yeah, you gotta have poor people.

2608
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:04,040
You gotta make sure people are poor, otherwise you won't feel good about what you have.

2609
03:04:04,040 --> 03:04:05,800
You gotta make sure they stay down.

2610
03:04:07,160 --> 03:04:13,000
Beauty, beauty is the feeling that you get when you look at something and you think,

2611
03:04:13,080 --> 03:04:14,760
I wish this could last forever.

2612
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:19,720
And if things did last forever, you would never have to think that.

2613
03:04:19,720 --> 03:04:21,800
So, um, nothing would be beautiful.

2614
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:25,480
So, uh, what are you, what do you want to make everything ugly?

2615
03:04:25,480 --> 03:04:27,560
Uh, you stupid, you, you stupid fuck.

2616
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:34,200
Um, you want to be like, did you see, did you see that fucking tweet that someone made today

2617
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:37,880
complaining about how they made a girl in a video game not hot enough?

2618
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:38,520
Did you see that?

2619
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:44,600
Uh, oh, the Horizon Zero Dawn lady, and they made the-

2620
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:46,680
I don't, the redhead girl?

2621
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:53,560
Yeah, and they made a version of it that was like their ideal, and it just looked like a really

2622
03:04:53,560 --> 03:04:57,880
strange, like, big smile, pearly whites commercial-

2623
03:04:57,880 --> 03:05:02,680
It just looked like what's her name, Princess Padme, uh, whatever her fucking name is.

2624
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:05,080
Uh, yeah, it just looked like a model.

2625
03:05:05,080 --> 03:05:06,360
It's like a model.

2626
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:07,560
This is, this is hotter.

2627
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:09,240
This is hotter, game.

2628
03:05:09,240 --> 03:05:10,040
This is prettier.

2629
03:05:10,040 --> 03:05:11,640
What, you're, you fucked up.

2630
03:05:11,640 --> 03:05:14,280
You could have made this character hotter, and you didn't-

2631
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:15,720
It really, it really confuses me.

2632
03:05:15,720 --> 03:05:17,480
Explain yourself, explain yourself.

2633
03:05:18,360 --> 03:05:23,240
Well, I guess it doesn't, shouldn't confuse me so much, but the, the fact that, like,

2634
03:05:23,240 --> 03:05:29,160
the people you see on the magazines and the billboards, the models, the quote-unquote,

2635
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:36,920
like, most beautiful types are actually so ingrained in certain people's minds that

2636
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:40,440
they want that in real life, even the real people never look like that.

2637
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:47,560
Like, I, even leaving aside the, like, is this a, a, a body type that we should be

2638
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:51,880
pedestalizing, even leaving that aside and just assuming, yeah, that's fine.

2639
03:05:51,880 --> 03:05:58,440
Like, do you not understand why maybe some characters wouldn't look like that?

2640
03:05:58,440 --> 03:05:59,400
Like, what's wrong with you?

2641
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:04,120
Are you fucking crazy that you just think like, oh, they didn't look like a fucking

2642
03:06:04,120 --> 03:06:05,080
toothpaste model.

2643
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:05,960
They did it wrong.

2644
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:10,920
No. They just made their character, like, kind of chubby and, like, gave them some kind of,

2645
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:11,720
like, splotchy-

2646
03:06:11,720 --> 03:06:13,560
No, Ben, you don't understand.

2647
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:14,600
Like, what's wrong with you?

2648
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,880
They play games to get erections.

2649
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:16,200
That is all-

2650
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:17,160
What's wrong with you?

2651
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:21,000
That you're like, this character doesn't look the way I would have drawn them.

2652
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:21,640
They fucked up.

2653
03:06:21,640 --> 03:06:22,440
They made a mistake.

2654
03:06:22,440 --> 03:06:22,680
No.

2655
03:06:23,400 --> 03:06:25,880
They, they look like that because they wanted them to look like that.

2656
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:26,680
Are you crazy?

2657
03:06:27,800 --> 03:06:28,600
What's going on in your head, bro?

2658
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:31,240
Wait, did they say, did they say they made a mistake?

2659
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:33,000
I thought it was just like, I don't like this.

2660
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,760
This should be this other way.

2661
03:06:35,480 --> 03:06:40,920
Well, I mean, I, I, maybe I'm reading into it, but like, I don't, like, clearly,

2662
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:45,320
hold on, let me, let me find, this is such a-

2663
03:06:45,320 --> 03:06:48,520
Find the image so we can, so we can put in the show notes because I can't remember-

2664
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:51,240
This is, this is such a stupid, a stupid tangent.

2665
03:06:51,240 --> 03:06:55,720
Um, uh, where did I fucking, where did I find it?

2666
03:06:55,720 --> 03:06:59,560
Oh, god, uh, Alpha, Apex J, right?

2667
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:04,040
Yeah, from, is it me or Sony B making their lead female protagonist look

2668
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:05,640
masculine as hell?

2669
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:08,840
Barely no curves or rough non-feminine features.

2670
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:10,760
Unlike the average woman.

2671
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:14,440
Like, um, last of us twos, Ellie, etc.

2672
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:17,000
Just saying, hashtag my two cents.

2673
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:18,520
Pick from the game on the left.

2674
03:07:18,520 --> 03:07:19,960
Fan made on the right.

2675
03:07:19,960 --> 03:07:21,000
Hire fans.

2676
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:21,560
I don't know.

2677
03:07:21,560 --> 03:07:23,960
To me, to me, I read this and I'm thinking like,

2678
03:07:25,720 --> 03:07:31,800
the hotter a girl character is, the objectively better the game is.

2679
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:34,360
And there's, and there's just no reason for them not to be.

2680
03:07:35,240 --> 03:07:41,560
Also, I don't know, the, the, like the character on the left is clearly a girl.

2681
03:07:42,520 --> 03:07:45,000
It's not, I hate this.

2682
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,960
This makes me so mad, so irritating.

2683
03:07:47,960 --> 03:07:49,000
Barely no curves.

2684
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:52,280
You can't even fucking, you can't even see your fucking body.

2685
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:54,680
You're on your fucking mind.

2686
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:55,880
I feel like they may have-

2687
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:58,520
This person has, this person literally has fucking brain problems.

2688
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:00,600
I'm sorry, this person's out of their fucking mind.

2689
03:08:02,360 --> 03:08:06,200
It was, I think it's confusing because like the image they're posting

2690
03:08:06,200 --> 03:08:09,320
does not seem to be what they're talking about necessarily.

2691
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:12,920
They just put that in as like, oh, the fans are better than the game developers.

2692
03:08:13,880 --> 03:08:17,000
As a fan, well, because like they say, oh, the average woman.

2693
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:20,120
But that image is not an average woman.

2694
03:08:20,120 --> 03:08:23,240
Do you think that the, do you think that the fucking Natalie Portman on the right

2695
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:25,000
is the average woman?

2696
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
No, like, I don't think they think that.

2697
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,400
I think they just put that there as like an extra dunk.

2698
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:35,000
Yeah, like their initial point has nothing, it's like, I don't know.

2699
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:39,480
Well, I mean the initial point juxtaposed with the pick from the game on the left

2700
03:08:39,480 --> 03:08:44,120
fan made on the, the pick from the game on the left fan made on the right says to me,

2701
03:08:45,560 --> 03:08:51,080
more conventionally pretty, always better, always more appropriate, right?

2702
03:08:52,760 --> 03:08:54,840
Higher fans because they'll just make them hotter.

2703
03:08:55,480 --> 03:09:02,520
Look at his first reply that he's like, he says, a lot of butt hurt people on here

2704
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:08,040
for opinion wanting to see more feminine women in video games where a female lead is presented.

2705
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:11,240
I thought freedom of speech existed in United States.

2706
03:09:11,240 --> 03:09:13,320
Wow, the world is far gone.

2707
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:15,080
Oh my God, okay.

2708
03:09:15,080 --> 03:09:16,360
This guy's insane.

2709
03:09:16,360 --> 03:09:20,440
Honestly, that has kind of pushed it over the edge for me to like,

2710
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:22,280
maybe I'm actually not that mad.

2711
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:23,640
This is actually pretty comical.

2712
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:26,040
Yeah, and then I replied to that.

2713
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:26,680
I feel better.

2714
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:28,360
I feel better now.

2715
03:09:28,360 --> 03:09:29,560
Yeah, I replied to that.

2716
03:09:29,560 --> 03:09:32,200
All I hear is bunch of beta males on here.

2717
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:34,760
Very unfortunate, more butt hurt, I suppose.

2718
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:35,880
I love feminine women.

2719
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:37,800
I just want to see more of it shrug.

2720
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:39,720
Hey, man, you know me too.

2721
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:43,080
You know, Sam, honestly, you know, that's, I can't fault you.

2722
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:45,320
Can't fault you on that one.

2723
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:53,880
Uh, I thought freedom of speech exists in United States.

2724
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:55,960
The world is far gone.

2725
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:00,040
Oh, oh boy.

2726
03:10:00,040 --> 03:10:00,680
Okay.

2727
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:01,240
You know what?

2728
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:04,200
Why are you even talking about this fucking Joker?

2729
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:06,680
I got upset thinking that this was like,

2730
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:09,480
oh, this is so representative.

2731
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:12,200
This is what's wrong with gamer culture and like it kind of is,

2732
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:16,120
but also this one is just like a particularly fucking dumb idiot.

2733
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:20,840
So, um, I can, I can breathe again.

2734
03:10:20,840 --> 03:10:21,720
I can breathe again.

2735
03:10:22,360 --> 03:10:25,080
Just like, just like the Black community can breathe again

2736
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:28,520
now that George Floyd's daughter got a photo op with President Biden.

2737
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:30,760
Did he nobly sacrifice?

2738
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:36,760
Yeah, he nobly sacrificed himself on the altar of racial justice

2739
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:39,240
to move us forward on the path of history.

2740
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:45,000
The arc of history curves toward justice, and he did it so much.

2741
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:49,880
He's got his daughter.

2742
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:51,480
He got his daughter that photo op.

2743
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:53,080
This is just what he would have wanted.

2744
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:55,640
This is just what he would have wanted to get fucking murdered

2745
03:10:55,640 --> 03:10:57,800
so his daughter could go to the White House.

2746
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,120
We've done him proud.

2747
03:11:03,400 --> 03:11:04,840
Society's fixed.

2748
03:11:04,840 --> 03:11:05,320
Thanks.

2749
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:06,440
Thanks, Democrats.

2750
03:11:06,440 --> 03:11:07,080
Okay.

2751
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:08,120
Good stuff.

2752
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:09,240
Good stuff.

2753
03:11:09,240 --> 03:11:14,200
Next voicemail is called Chip T Coming Good.

2754
03:11:14,200 --> 03:11:15,000
Okay.

2755
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,240
Three, two, one, go.

2756
03:11:18,600 --> 03:11:21,880
Greetings, gentlemen, and well met.

2757
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:26,040
My name is Chip T Coming Good.

2758
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:32,200
You might recall my voice from a previous voicemail concerning the Necronomicon.

2759
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:33,000
Barely.

2760
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,480
Though I am no longer a narrator.

2761
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:38,440
I am an archaeologist.

2762
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:47,720
What it is that I, Chip T Coming Good, do is dig for and study ancient bones.

2763
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:58,600
Contrary to that, I myself have a bone, and I would very, very much like for it to be studied.

2764
03:11:59,400 --> 03:12:00,200
I ain't.

2765
03:12:01,160 --> 03:12:04,760
It shall be my bone doing the digging this time.

2766
03:12:05,480 --> 03:12:06,680
And truly, I shall be-

2767
03:12:06,680 --> 03:12:10,440
I read you loud and clear, Mr. Coming Good.

2768
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:10,920
Of course.

2769
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:14,680
Myself and my compatriots.

2770
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:16,520
Message received.

2771
03:12:16,520 --> 03:12:18,200
Of niche lovers.

2772
03:12:19,480 --> 03:12:23,400
Oh, and yes, Mr. Saint.

2773
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:28,040
Be a good chap and return to me the bone scroll.

2774
03:12:29,320 --> 03:12:30,120
Charming chap.

2775
03:12:30,760 --> 03:12:31,720
Good day, gents.

2776
03:12:32,520 --> 03:12:33,720
Yes to fucking Nate.

2777
03:12:33,720 --> 03:12:35,480
No to the bone scroll.

2778
03:12:35,480 --> 03:12:36,760
More scrolls.

2779
03:12:36,760 --> 03:12:37,560
More scrolls.

2780
03:12:37,560 --> 03:12:39,720
I'm like the sheriff.

2781
03:12:40,280 --> 03:12:41,480
You're like a librarian.

2782
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:42,280
More like-

2783
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:46,360
I'm like the sheriff in Robin Hood.

2784
03:12:46,360 --> 03:12:48,920
Only instead of taxes, I like scrolls.

2785
03:12:49,960 --> 03:12:51,240
And you're not the authority.

2786
03:12:51,240 --> 03:12:52,440
You're just some guy.

2787
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:53,320
And I'm not a cop.

2788
03:12:53,320 --> 03:12:54,440
I'm just a guy.

2789
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:54,680
Yeah.

2790
03:12:56,200 --> 03:12:56,440
Right?

2791
03:12:57,720 --> 03:13:00,680
Didn't the sheriff just go around being like more taxes?

2792
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:01,720
I have like a-

2793
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:04,360
I don't know if I've ever even watched that movie.

2794
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:09,080
I just have this idea that the cop went around screaming more taxes.

2795
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:10,280
I need more taxes.

2796
03:13:10,840 --> 03:13:12,840
No, you're talking about the Disney?

2797
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:14,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2798
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:14,600
The Disney one.

2799
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:19,080
That was probably the King John saying more taxes.

2800
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:21,560
I want more money.

2801
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:22,200
Oh, maybe.

2802
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:23,880
And then the sheriff was going like,

2803
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:27,400
all right, the King says you gotta give us some money now.

2804
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:30,120
What you doing there?

2805
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:31,480
I forget what his voice was,

2806
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:33,800
but he was the big fat guy, the big fat wolf man.

2807
03:13:35,800 --> 03:13:37,960
Yeah, but he's in like a blue,

2808
03:13:37,960 --> 03:13:41,160
like he's in like a blue like Bobby uniform, right?

2809
03:13:41,160 --> 03:13:44,200
He's like a blue like cop uniform button down.

2810
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:45,560
No, I think it was red.

2811
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:47,240
Am I thinking-

2812
03:13:47,240 --> 03:13:48,120
Who am I thinking of?

2813
03:13:48,120 --> 03:13:50,440
I'm picturing like a guy in a blue.

2814
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:53,880
King John is the lion though, right?

2815
03:13:53,880 --> 03:13:54,680
Yeah, yeah.

2816
03:13:55,400 --> 03:13:55,640
Yeah.

2817
03:13:56,760 --> 03:13:57,640
Who is the fuck?

2818
03:13:57,640 --> 03:14:00,280
Is it from like Great Mouse Capade that I'm thinking of like

2819
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:04,040
a fox or something in like a blue police uniform?

2820
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:07,080
Well, Maid Marion had a blue robe.

2821
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
I know what fucking Maid Marion looks like.

2822
03:14:12,840 --> 03:14:15,640
You know, it could be the Great Mouse Detective.

2823
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:17,640
I haven't seen that one in a while.

2824
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:25,400
I'm blue Bobby uniform with like a round hat on and button down and

2825
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:27,880
I think it's a- I don't know.

2826
03:14:27,880 --> 03:14:29,640
I don't know, I thought it was Robin Hood, but what do I know?

2827
03:14:30,920 --> 03:14:34,280
Next one is called Frank the Wretch.

2828
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:36,440
Three, two, one, go.

2829
03:14:37,560 --> 03:14:43,880
They called me Frank the Wretch and I got- hang on a minute.

2830
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:47,800
Okay.

2831
03:14:47,800 --> 03:14:48,520
Sorry about that.

2832
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:52,920
Anyway, I'll just cut right to the chase.

2833
03:14:53,560 --> 03:14:54,520
I'm part of a-

2834
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:56,280
Is this the point of this going to be that you want to fuck me?

2835
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:57,480
Group and what?

2836
03:14:58,520 --> 03:14:58,760
Okay.

2837
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:02,200
I'm part of a group and what we do is-

2838
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:03,800
It's fucking me.

2839
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

2840
03:15:05,720 --> 03:15:06,120
Sucks.

2841
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:07,400
I'm- I don't care.

2842
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:08,040
I don't care.

2843
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:08,840
I'm turning it off.

2844
03:15:09,480 --> 03:15:12,520
Yeah, Frank the- yeah, I'm sorry about your illness.

2845
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:13,240
Okay, next.

2846
03:15:15,880 --> 03:15:16,200
Lol.

2847
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:17,240
Whoops.

2848
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:20,440
Next one is called Road Work Ahead.

2849
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:22,040
I sure hope it does.

2850
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:24,280
Three, two, one, go.

2851
03:15:25,480 --> 03:15:26,920
Road to Ratcom.

2852
03:15:28,120 --> 03:15:28,920
Is it dead?

2853
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:31,320
I can't find any of it.

2854
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:33,400
Maybe I'm stupid.

2855
03:15:33,400 --> 03:15:37,080
Should we just not expect that to be finished?

2856
03:15:37,080 --> 03:15:37,560
Oh, yeah.

2857
03:15:39,400 --> 03:15:40,040
Yeah, we can't-

2858
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:44,520
We can't expect Trixie to do the last chapter,

2859
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:47,480
so we're probably just going to write it ourselves.

2860
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:49,480
That's- that's what we decided, yeah.

2861
03:15:49,480 --> 03:15:51,320
Like, she's not- she's not going to fucking do it.

2862
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:57,640
We have- we have the text files of the original,

2863
03:15:57,640 --> 03:16:00,040
so yeah, at some point we're just going to-

2864
03:16:01,400 --> 03:16:03,400
We said we'd do it before and then we didn't do it,

2865
03:16:03,400 --> 03:16:05,240
but we'll- we'll get around to it.

2866
03:16:05,240 --> 03:16:07,800
I'm going to read through it and then you can read through it

2867
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:10,120
and we can- we'll come up with a fifth chapter,

2868
03:16:11,240 --> 03:16:11,800
write it.

2869
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:13,880
Yeah, we're still going to do it.

2870
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:15,000
It's not going to be by Trixie,

2871
03:16:15,560 --> 03:16:16,920
but it's- we're going to do it.

2872
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:21,400
Along with the dojin, which is another fucking can of worms,

2873
03:16:21,400 --> 03:16:22,360
but we'll get around to it.

2874
03:16:23,480 --> 03:16:24,120
That's the answer.

2875
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:28,440
Next one is called Phantom the Phantasm.

2876
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:30,840
Three, two, one, go.

2877
03:16:31,960 --> 03:16:34,600
Hello, PCP.

2878
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:38,360
I am phantom the phantasm.

2879
03:16:39,400 --> 03:16:44,920
A visitor from the spirit realm of which you cannot fathom.

2880
03:16:45,800 --> 03:16:50,840
I come here seeking mortals of high social stratum,

2881
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:56,840
one whom I can cover in my ghostly ectoplasm.

2882
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:59,000
So step aside.

2883
03:16:59,000 --> 03:16:59,480
Okay, thank you.

2884
03:16:59,480 --> 03:17:00,600
I'm tired of these.

2885
03:17:00,600 --> 03:17:02,360
They're not- they're not funny.

2886
03:17:02,360 --> 03:17:03,400
Yeah, thank you, Mr.-

2887
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:04,840
The joke is old.

2888
03:17:04,840 --> 03:17:06,040
Yeah, it's-

2889
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:06,360
It's done.

2890
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:08,360
Come up with a new gimmick.

2891
03:17:08,360 --> 03:17:11,000
I have- I have a bit of a fondness for it,

2892
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
but in my- I know you're right.

2893
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:14,440
You're- you're absolutely right.

2894
03:17:14,440 --> 03:17:15,400
Sorry, everyone.

2895
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:17,080
Fuck you.

2896
03:17:17,080 --> 03:17:23,160
Next one is called Rescue Scat in Pace to Recuseat in Pace.

2897
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:26,680
In Pach- Recuseat in Pache, I think is how you say that?

2898
03:17:26,680 --> 03:17:28,680
To the PCP Wiki.

2899
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:29,320
Oh, no.

2900
03:17:29,320 --> 03:17:31,080
Three, two, one, go.

2901
03:17:32,680 --> 03:17:37,320
Procrastopedia was an encyclopedia for all things procrastinators.

2902
03:17:37,320 --> 03:17:40,040
The Wiki has been locked in all perjages protected

2903
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:42,600
due to inactivity, privacy, vandalism,

2904
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:46,360
and some regrettable choices regarding how the information is presented.

2905
03:17:46,360 --> 03:17:48,440
Not to mention much of the information itself.

2906
03:17:49,080 --> 03:17:52,040
Many members, former or otherwise of the procrastinators,

2907
03:17:52,040 --> 03:17:55,000
regret much of what they've made and would like to move on.

2908
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:57,320
Given how the era is over,

2909
03:17:57,320 --> 03:17:59,480
how much of the information is outdated,

2910
03:17:59,480 --> 03:18:02,920
and that we respect the privacy and wishes of those who the

2911
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:06,120
Wiki has borne around, it's closed indefinitely.

2912
03:18:07,560 --> 03:18:10,280
Insert Base Boothed Ceramic Lachlan Song here.

2913
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:12,440
Well, that's stupid.

2914
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:15,000
That was very quiet.

2915
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:15,880
What did they say?

2916
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:17,560
It was very quiet.

2917
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:19,160
Well, this person is saying,

2918
03:18:21,400 --> 03:18:22,280
this is so dumb.

2919
03:18:23,320 --> 03:18:24,120
What's wrong with you?

2920
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:31,160
Like, he said, sorry, I'm not assuming.

2921
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:34,040
They said, and I'm, yes, I'm going to be better.

2922
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:35,160
I'm trying to be better.

2923
03:18:35,160 --> 03:18:37,880
Live the change I want to see in the world.

2924
03:18:37,880 --> 03:18:41,480
They said that now that the PCP,

2925
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:44,600
people have quit the PCP and some people don't,

2926
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:48,920
some people aren't happy with the previous things they made,

2927
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:52,280
they're closing down the PCP Wiki.

2928
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:55,800
And I think that's just so fucking brain dead.

2929
03:18:55,800 --> 03:19:00,360
Like, oh, okay, now that the information is not current,

2930
03:19:00,360 --> 03:19:01,880
it shouldn't be archived anymore.

2931
03:19:01,880 --> 03:19:05,160
What do you think an archive is you fucking moron?

2932
03:19:05,160 --> 03:19:07,400
What do you think a record exists for?

2933
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:10,680
It's to record information about the past.

2934
03:19:11,960 --> 03:19:14,200
Like, I don't know if it's your Wiki

2935
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:15,800
and you're in control of it, do what you want.

2936
03:19:17,400 --> 03:19:18,600
But that's so stupid.

2937
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:21,640
Like, wait, is this the owner of the Wiki?

2938
03:19:22,280 --> 03:19:23,720
I don't know who this is.

2939
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:25,160
This person is speaking as though

2940
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:27,880
they have some kind of authority over the Wiki,

2941
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:29,480
which maybe they do.

2942
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:29,960
I don't know.

2943
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:34,040
I thought the, I like Wikis.

2944
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:35,400
I like that records exist.

2945
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:38,200
What is the point of documenting something

2946
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:39,800
if as soon as it becomes outdated,

2947
03:19:39,800 --> 03:19:42,120
you delete it because, oh, people have changed?

2948
03:19:43,720 --> 03:19:47,320
This, I hope, I'm getting angry.

2949
03:19:47,320 --> 03:19:50,440
I hope this isn't a widespread attitude about stuff

2950
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:53,000
because it's really stupid and dumb and bad.

2951
03:19:55,080 --> 03:19:57,320
And I mean, I don't know if you think that like,

2952
03:19:57,880 --> 03:19:59,560
when the situation changes,

2953
03:19:59,560 --> 03:20:03,000
it's time to delete all record of how things were before,

2954
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
then like, what is the fucking point of you?

2955
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:06,840
What is the fucking point of anything you've done?

2956
03:20:08,200 --> 03:20:09,080
Good fucking luck.

2957
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:12,520
I hope this person doesn't actually have any say

2958
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:13,560
in what happens to the Wiki.

2959
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:15,720
If they do, then, I don't know, rip.

2960
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:17,560
Sucks, I guess.

2961
03:20:17,560 --> 03:20:20,280
Yeah, I went to it closed.

2962
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:22,680
Procrastopedia was an encyclopedia

2963
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:24,120
for all things procrastinators.

2964
03:20:24,120 --> 03:20:26,200
The Wiki has been locked and all pages protected

2965
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:28,840
due to inactivity, privacy, vandalism,

2966
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:30,200
and some regrettable choices

2967
03:20:30,200 --> 03:20:32,040
regarding how the information is presented.

2968
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
Not to mention much of the information itself.

2969
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:40,040
I think he's just read this thing in this voicemail.

2970
03:20:41,320 --> 03:20:45,160
Many members regret what much of it would like to move on.

2971
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:49,320
This, who did, okay.

2972
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:52,120
Who did they talk to?

2973
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:55,400
Did they ask anyone?

2974
03:20:55,400 --> 03:20:56,520
They didn't ask me.

2975
03:20:56,520 --> 03:20:59,080
About, and they didn't ask me?

2976
03:20:59,960 --> 03:21:01,400
Maybe they talked, I don't know,

2977
03:21:01,400 --> 03:21:03,320
maybe they asked someone and someone said,

2978
03:21:03,320 --> 03:21:04,360
I regret some of this stuff.

2979
03:21:05,240 --> 03:21:07,800
I don't know, if there's regrettable choices

2980
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:09,320
about how the information is presented,

2981
03:21:09,960 --> 03:21:11,800
you could change it if you wanted to.

2982
03:21:12,360 --> 03:21:13,080
I don't know.

2983
03:21:13,080 --> 03:21:14,440
I mean, you don't have to do that.

2984
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:17,720
I'm not saying, oh, do you put the work in and change it?

2985
03:21:18,360 --> 03:21:19,080
I don't know.

2986
03:21:19,080 --> 03:21:20,360
It's a fucking document.

2987
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:21,080
It's a record.

2988
03:21:21,080 --> 03:21:22,360
Is some of it bad?

2989
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:23,480
Well, I don't know.

2990
03:21:23,480 --> 03:21:26,600
You can change it or you can leave it as a like,

2991
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:28,440
yeah, this is what it was like at the time.

2992
03:21:28,440 --> 03:21:29,800
This is what people thought at the time,

2993
03:21:29,800 --> 03:21:32,280
regrettable, maybe, make up your own mind.

2994
03:21:32,840 --> 03:21:37,720
This is like, it's a little disgusting, honestly.

2995
03:21:37,720 --> 03:21:39,880
It's a little bit of a disgusting attitude to take.

2996
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:42,280
When things change, you delete all,

2997
03:21:42,280 --> 03:21:44,280
you delete all record of how they used to be.

2998
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:45,160
Fuck off.

2999
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:48,120
I really, I mean, my thing.

3000
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:50,120
I don't want to be too mean because these people did this

3001
03:21:50,120 --> 03:21:52,520
out of their own like generosity.

3002
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:54,040
It was their decision.

3003
03:21:54,040 --> 03:21:55,320
They ran this wiki.

3004
03:21:55,400 --> 03:21:56,520
They ran this wiki.

3005
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:57,720
And it was cool that they ran it.

3006
03:21:57,720 --> 03:22:00,120
And I don't want to like spit on that,

3007
03:22:00,120 --> 03:22:03,880
but I do want to spit on this decision.

3008
03:22:04,840 --> 03:22:07,240
I mean, fuck, hand it off to someone else

3009
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:08,360
if you don't want to run it anymore.

3010
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:11,160
I don't know.

3011
03:22:11,160 --> 03:22:13,000
I mean, I guess I'm glad they're just locked

3012
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:13,880
instead of deleted.

3013
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:14,840
I don't know.

3014
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:15,640
Why would you do this?

3015
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:20,920
I feel like the most annoying part of this

3016
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:23,000
is that they didn't ask us,

3017
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
which leads me to believe that they,

3018
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,720
either asked some of the members or not all of them

3019
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:28,680
or just assumed,

3020
03:22:30,840 --> 03:22:31,880
because like, I don't know,

3021
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:34,200
maybe I'd like access to it.

3022
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:36,520
I guess I didn't use it,

3023
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:39,160
but yeah, it is kind of the principle of the matter.

3024
03:22:39,160 --> 03:22:41,720
I hadn't checked it in a while.

3025
03:22:41,720 --> 03:22:44,360
I assume, yeah, I assume it hadn't been

3026
03:22:44,360 --> 03:22:47,080
that active recently, maybe not at all.

3027
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:48,600
Now we can't even look back.

3028
03:22:48,600 --> 03:22:49,320
So why?

3029
03:22:49,320 --> 03:22:51,560
I guess all the videos are still there, but like.

3030
03:22:51,560 --> 03:22:52,360
What is the point?

3031
03:22:52,360 --> 03:22:53,160
This is so dumb.

3032
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:53,960
Yeah.

3033
03:22:54,040 --> 03:22:55,560
Okay, that's my takeaway.

3034
03:22:55,560 --> 03:22:57,320
You're in whoever made this decision,

3035
03:22:57,320 --> 03:22:57,960
you're an idiot.

3036
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:00,280
Thanks for maintaining the wiki.

3037
03:23:00,280 --> 03:23:01,320
I thought it was cool.

3038
03:23:01,320 --> 03:23:02,280
Oh, you threw it in the trash?

3039
03:23:02,280 --> 03:23:03,480
Well, you're a fucking idiot.

3040
03:23:03,480 --> 03:23:04,440
You know, good job.

3041
03:23:06,440 --> 03:23:07,560
Am I being too salty?

3042
03:23:08,760 --> 03:23:09,960
Am I being unfair?

3043
03:23:09,960 --> 03:23:10,440
I don't know.

3044
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:11,960
It's very annoying.

3045
03:23:11,960 --> 03:23:13,240
At this point, I'm just tired

3046
03:23:13,240 --> 03:23:15,720
and I want to stop recording the podcast.

3047
03:23:15,720 --> 03:23:17,320
It's two voicemails.

3048
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:17,880
Fair.

3049
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:19,240
Okay, we got a few more.

3050
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:21,800
Next one is called Homeless Ben Part 4.

3051
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:23,640
Three, two, one, go.

3052
03:23:24,680 --> 03:23:26,920
Yes, I predicted this over a year ago

3053
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:28,760
and it's finally true.

3054
03:23:28,760 --> 03:23:30,840
Drunk Homeless Ben.

3055
03:23:30,840 --> 03:23:33,320
Ben, you have to fulfill the prophecy.

3056
03:23:33,320 --> 03:23:36,120
You have to travel all the way down to Virginia

3057
03:23:36,120 --> 03:23:38,280
and take a fat shit in its sink.

3058
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:39,320
Lately.

3059
03:23:45,480 --> 03:23:47,320
Okay, I'll think about it.

3060
03:23:51,400 --> 03:23:51,720
Cool.

3061
03:23:51,720 --> 03:23:53,560
Next one is called Ben on Twitter.

3062
03:23:53,960 --> 03:23:55,880
Three, two, one, go.

3063
03:23:56,920 --> 03:24:00,440
Ben, quote, if you make them cry,

3064
03:24:00,440 --> 03:24:02,280
you win the argument, saint.

3065
03:24:05,640 --> 03:24:07,640
I mean, that sounds like Ben's saint to me.

3066
03:24:08,760 --> 03:24:09,880
That is what I said.

3067
03:24:10,680 --> 03:24:12,440
And I absolutely still believe it.

3068
03:24:13,560 --> 03:24:14,680
Absolutely 100%.

3069
03:24:16,680 --> 03:24:17,320
Time out.

3070
03:24:17,320 --> 03:24:18,280
You got time out.

3071
03:24:18,280 --> 03:24:21,400
You're going to go sit in the bully chair

3072
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:23,480
into the harassment chair.

3073
03:24:24,200 --> 03:24:25,480
The harassment chair.

3074
03:24:25,480 --> 03:24:32,120
I will, well, what if I just said,

3075
03:24:32,120 --> 03:24:33,480
no, I'm not going to sit in it?

3076
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:37,880
Well, then what if I just keep doing what I'm...

3077
03:24:37,880 --> 03:24:41,400
I'm just going to push you until you're falling over

3078
03:24:41,400 --> 03:24:42,360
and then you're going to hit your knee.

3079
03:24:42,360 --> 03:24:42,600
That's aggravated.

3080
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:43,800
You're going to scrape your knee

3081
03:24:43,800 --> 03:24:44,920
and it's going to be blood and you're going to cry.

3082
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:45,480
That's aggravated assault.

3083
03:24:46,440 --> 03:24:47,240
That's battery.

3084
03:24:48,600 --> 03:24:49,560
No, this is a battery.

3085
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:50,360
You're going to be in jail.

3086
03:24:50,360 --> 03:24:51,640
I hold up the battery.

3087
03:24:51,640 --> 03:24:52,520
This is a visual joke.

3088
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:54,360
You're going to jail.

3089
03:24:56,760 --> 03:24:57,240
That's it.

3090
03:24:57,240 --> 03:24:58,440
You're going to jail.

3091
03:25:01,240 --> 03:25:02,200
Okay, let's...

3092
03:25:02,200 --> 03:25:03,960
Okay, the next one is called No Voicemail,

3093
03:25:03,960 --> 03:25:05,880
just this, and it's a YouTube link,

3094
03:25:05,880 --> 03:25:08,280
but I copied the link and it doesn't work.

3095
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:09,480
Oh, yeah.

3096
03:25:10,040 --> 03:25:10,600
So...

3097
03:25:10,600 --> 03:25:11,720
Yeah, that's not...

3098
03:25:11,720 --> 03:25:12,680
I think it's too long.

3099
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:15,240
I think the URL is too long.

3100
03:25:15,240 --> 03:25:15,640
Sorry.

3101
03:25:17,400 --> 03:25:18,040
No voicemail.

3102
03:25:18,040 --> 03:25:18,760
Do you know how to fucking bitly link or something?

3103
03:25:18,760 --> 03:25:19,880
Just nothing.

3104
03:25:20,600 --> 03:25:20,840
Yeah.

3105
03:25:21,080 --> 03:25:22,120
Yeah.

3106
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:24,760
Next one is Roxanne Kaiser.

3107
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:27,160
I know who they are.

3108
03:25:27,160 --> 03:25:29,560
Okay, three, two, one, go.

3109
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:46,680
So I'm flying out to Columbus, Ohio in December for TrotCon 2021.

3110
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:48,920
Tom might be there too,

3111
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
so the only question is,

3112
03:25:52,120 --> 03:25:53,640
you coming or what?

3113
03:25:57,160 --> 03:25:58,280
TrotCon, huh?

3114
03:25:59,160 --> 03:26:01,320
I mean, I don't know.

3115
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:05,800
I guess there's not much of a draw.

3116
03:26:05,800 --> 03:26:10,040
Like, pony conventions, for me, are only to meet friends.

3117
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:12,280
They are not to be at the pony convention.

3118
03:26:12,840 --> 03:26:15,080
So if there's a convention that people are going to,

3119
03:26:15,080 --> 03:26:17,240
I'd want to go, but I don't know.

3120
03:26:17,320 --> 03:26:22,360
We went to the last BronyCon because it was the last one.

3121
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:25,880
So I don't know.

3122
03:26:25,880 --> 03:26:29,720
We're very thoroughly not in the pony sphere anymore.

3123
03:26:30,760 --> 03:26:34,440
I mean, I do want to watch the movie.

3124
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:37,320
I do want to watch the new movie when it comes out, just for fun.

3125
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:40,840
Will it be out by then, will it?

3126
03:26:40,840 --> 03:26:41,560
By December?

3127
03:26:43,400 --> 03:26:45,480
I don't know, maybe.

3128
03:26:46,440 --> 03:26:48,520
But I don't know.

3129
03:26:48,520 --> 03:26:49,080
I'm not...

3130
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:54,200
Like, I hadn't been going to BronyCon for a while before that.

3131
03:26:54,200 --> 03:26:56,360
I only went to the last one because it was the last one.

3132
03:26:56,920 --> 03:27:00,200
I don't feel any particular need to go to TrotCon.

3133
03:27:02,840 --> 03:27:04,200
I'm going to say probably no,

3134
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:07,240
but maybe if...

3135
03:27:08,520 --> 03:27:09,080
I don't know.

3136
03:27:09,080 --> 03:27:11,240
I wouldn't say never, but probably not.

3137
03:27:11,480 --> 03:27:19,240
Okay, we have the last voicemail, and it's called Genuinely Curious.

3138
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:21,400
Three, two, one, go.

3139
03:27:22,840 --> 03:27:23,960
Hey, PCP.

3140
03:27:23,960 --> 03:27:25,960
It's Riley, not that Riley.

3141
03:27:26,760 --> 03:27:30,680
I was just curious about why you're also staunchly against the idea of monkey just

3142
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:32,200
coming on the show for an episode.

3143
03:27:32,920 --> 03:27:36,760
It seems like we're so far separated now from the drama that happened many years ago.

3144
03:27:37,400 --> 03:27:40,280
If monkey in earnest wants to come on the show for an episode,

3145
03:27:40,280 --> 03:27:43,480
completely separated from the Trixie drama, why turn him down?

3146
03:27:44,040 --> 03:27:49,000
It's obvious that monkey and the PCP have a somewhat decent, sizable crossover audience,

3147
03:27:49,560 --> 03:27:52,760
and I've seen people on the Patreon Discord pushing for monkey to come on.

3148
03:27:53,400 --> 03:27:56,760
But the variety of guests that have come on the PCP in the past year or so,

3149
03:27:56,760 --> 03:27:57,880
it feels like a no-brainer.

3150
03:27:58,520 --> 03:28:01,320
Do you guys still resent him for the kicking drama,

3151
03:28:01,320 --> 03:28:04,120
or is there something else that makes you reluctant to have him on the podcast?

3152
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:06,200
I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers.

3153
03:28:06,200 --> 03:28:06,600
I'm just curious.

3154
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:07,560
I feel like I've answered this.

3155
03:28:07,560 --> 03:28:10,040
Love you guys, love the show, keep doing what you're doing.

3156
03:28:10,280 --> 03:28:11,480
Ben, return the RVs.

3157
03:28:13,080 --> 03:28:18,120
I agree that all the kicking drama is water under the bridge,

3158
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:19,480
and I don't care about that at all.

3159
03:28:23,880 --> 03:28:30,360
I agree that whatever, I'm not mad at him or anything.

3160
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:31,320
It's nothing like that.

3161
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:36,760
I would have him on, but at the same time, I would want to talk to him about Trixie,

3162
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:38,760
because that seems like the obvious thing to talk about.

3163
03:28:39,720 --> 03:28:44,920
I don't really want to talk to him about, I don't know, whatever else.

3164
03:28:46,200 --> 03:28:47,000
That much?

3165
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:47,640
I don't know.

3166
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:54,360
That's just the one thing that I do want to get his take on,

3167
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,280
and he apparently doesn't want to talk about that.

3168
03:28:56,280 --> 03:28:59,400
So I'm like, well, okay.

3169
03:29:01,960 --> 03:29:02,680
That's it.

3170
03:29:03,480 --> 03:29:10,200
From my end, a lot of it is really just that I have no real interest in him and what he does.

3171
03:29:13,720 --> 03:29:17,240
I'm interested in hearing, I'm interested in talking about Yig with him.

3172
03:29:17,240 --> 03:29:22,280
That's the one thing that I'm interested to hear your take about it.

3173
03:29:22,840 --> 03:29:26,920
I'm sure he could be fun on a podcast, but like.

3174
03:29:27,560 --> 03:29:31,080
Because he has, there's history there between him and Riley.

3175
03:29:31,080 --> 03:29:34,520
Riley tried to scam him, or he tried to run a scam

3176
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:37,320
based on pretending to be him or something like that.

3177
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:42,840
So there's more context there that I don't know that much about, but it's interesting.

3178
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:44,840
That's why.

3179
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:49,640
It's just sort of a weird fit.

3180
03:29:50,200 --> 03:29:53,720
Mumki was, he made that one video.

3181
03:29:56,120 --> 03:29:59,560
We got an HK Mumki's anime reviews,

3182
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:07,080
and we were all like, oh, it's just like my Japanese anime sort of video.

3183
03:30:08,600 --> 03:30:09,400
It was really funny.

3184
03:30:10,280 --> 03:30:14,920
And then people who were not me got into Mumki's videos.

3185
03:30:15,880 --> 03:30:20,600
I was just sort of around, so I don't really care one way or the other,

3186
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:25,480
but I also don't really like him for like, I don't know.

3187
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:30,840
I don't really want to get into it exactly, but like.

3188
03:30:30,840 --> 03:30:31,400
It's fine.

3189
03:30:32,600 --> 03:30:36,280
The Mumki kicking drama specifically is not the problem.

3190
03:30:36,280 --> 03:30:39,640
It's sort of the way he is and the way he conducts himself.

3191
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:40,680
I don't like.

3192
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:43,080
Sure.

3193
03:30:44,040 --> 03:30:45,560
No super hard feelings.

3194
03:30:45,560 --> 03:30:49,320
Like if I met him in person, I wouldn't like hate him or anything.

3195
03:30:49,320 --> 03:30:53,880
I just feel no drive to get him on my show or our show.

3196
03:30:55,160 --> 03:31:00,760
My willingness to talk to him about Trixie stuff is not because like,

3197
03:31:01,320 --> 03:31:02,120
oh, I really like him.

3198
03:31:02,120 --> 03:31:02,920
I want him on the show.

3199
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:07,400
It's just because I feel like he has a specific insight into it.

3200
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:09,240
And that's interesting.

3201
03:31:10,200 --> 03:31:13,720
And then and I'm not, I'm not like.

3202
03:31:15,640 --> 03:31:18,840
Like I would have him back on the show for that specific reason or I would,

3203
03:31:18,840 --> 03:31:22,280
I'm not just like generally like, oh, I want to get Mumki back on the show.

3204
03:31:22,280 --> 03:31:23,400
Like I don't really care.

3205
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:28,920
I don't care to just do that just because I don't.

3206
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:29,720
I just don't care.

3207
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:32,360
Yeah, I don't know.

3208
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:34,840
Does that explain everything?

3209
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:37,400
I feel like that's hopefully it does.

3210
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:41,800
I mean, yeah, it feels weird to just come out and say, yeah, I don't really like Mumki.

3211
03:31:43,320 --> 03:31:48,200
And I have avoided saying that, but like, you know, if it comes down to it,

3212
03:31:48,200 --> 03:31:51,240
that's basically just the reason I just don't, I don't like him.

3213
03:31:52,760 --> 03:31:59,560
That's, I don't, yeah, he's, I don't want to overstate it or anything.

3214
03:31:59,560 --> 03:32:03,000
I do think his attitude is a little like, it comes across as a little

3215
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:05,720
bad.

3216
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:06,200
I don't know.

3217
03:32:06,200 --> 03:32:13,400
Sometimes like he seemed kind of aggressive or like mad when I asked him if he wanted

3218
03:32:13,400 --> 03:32:15,960
to talk about Trixie and I didn't understand why.

3219
03:32:17,080 --> 03:32:18,200
Maybe I was just misreading.

3220
03:32:18,200 --> 03:32:18,520
I don't know.

3221
03:32:18,520 --> 03:32:19,640
It just came across that way.

3222
03:32:19,640 --> 03:32:21,400
Like he was annoyed.

3223
03:32:21,400 --> 03:32:23,880
And like, I don't, I don't, I don't know.

3224
03:32:24,760 --> 03:32:25,320
Whatever.

3225
03:32:25,320 --> 03:32:26,360
It doesn't matter.

3226
03:32:26,360 --> 03:32:27,080
It doesn't matter.

3227
03:32:29,480 --> 03:32:30,680
That's my, that's my reason.

3228
03:32:31,640 --> 03:32:34,840
I would want to talk to him about that one thing because he's got a particular insight,

3229
03:32:35,480 --> 03:32:36,760
but he doesn't want to talk about it.

3230
03:32:36,760 --> 03:32:37,480
So I don't know.

3231
03:32:38,040 --> 03:32:40,840
I hope your genuine curiosity is sated.

3232
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:42,600
Yeah.

3233
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:42,920
Okay.

3234
03:32:43,960 --> 03:32:46,760
Well, um, shit, I guess that's the last one.

3235
03:32:46,760 --> 03:32:47,960
I guess we're finally done.

3236
03:32:47,960 --> 03:32:49,080
It's been like four hours.

3237
03:32:50,280 --> 03:32:55,080
Yeah, I mean, we had a decently large discussion and then times two for

3238
03:32:55,080 --> 03:32:56,680
voicemails as it always is.

3239
03:32:57,640 --> 03:32:58,200
True.

3240
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:01,320
Sorry, everyone.

3241
03:33:01,320 --> 03:33:02,600
I'm sorry.

3242
03:33:02,600 --> 03:33:03,320
Okay.

3243
03:33:03,320 --> 03:33:04,200
Let's wrap this up.

3244
03:33:05,400 --> 03:33:09,800
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators, whole bunch of bonus episodes,

3245
03:33:10,440 --> 03:33:14,440
access to the PCP Minecraft server, which we should do in other shekels for heckles.

3246
03:33:14,440 --> 03:33:14,760
Yes.

3247
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:18,840
I said, I said I was down to do one this past week and then I forgot.

3248
03:33:18,840 --> 03:33:19,240
Sorry.

3249
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:22,680
Yeah, I mean, I forgot to remind you as well.

3250
03:33:22,680 --> 03:33:23,720
So whatever.

3251
03:33:23,720 --> 03:33:24,440
Yeah, let's do one.

3252
03:33:24,440 --> 03:33:25,240
Let's do one this week.

3253
03:33:26,680 --> 03:33:30,200
Let's have done one this week already by the time this episode comes out.

3254
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:33,400
But that's another perk of becoming a patron.

3255
03:33:33,400 --> 03:33:33,720
Yes.

3256
03:33:33,720 --> 03:33:39,800
In addition to the bonus episodes, you now also get the Minecraft that was previously

3257
03:33:39,800 --> 03:33:40,760
on a different patron.

3258
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:41,880
It's now in this one.

3259
03:33:41,880 --> 03:33:45,080
So there's even more value for your five bucks a month.

3260
03:33:45,080 --> 03:33:48,520
We've merged them, merging the value, double the value.

3261
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:54,200
And I don't know, send us a voicemail, but only if you're not a fucking

3262
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:59,800
Natefucker with a voice modulator and a 90 minute long fucking character backstory.

3263
03:34:02,680 --> 03:34:05,720
Okay, people, people got to stop being copycats.

3264
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:09,720
You know, so once one person came up with a funny idea to fuck Nate,

3265
03:34:09,720 --> 03:34:15,240
and then another person came up with a funny idea to attack Ben for stealing the scrolls,

3266
03:34:15,240 --> 03:34:16,520
got to come up with something different.

3267
03:34:17,320 --> 03:34:19,800
You can't just be the scroll guy, too.

3268
03:34:19,800 --> 03:34:21,400
You can't be another Natefucker.

3269
03:34:21,400 --> 03:34:22,440
You got to do more.

3270
03:34:22,440 --> 03:34:28,360
I appreciate references to past voicemails, but there's got to be more.

3271
03:34:29,000 --> 03:34:32,200
They only like you characters, base joker, I think.

3272
03:34:32,840 --> 03:34:34,680
And maybe the Monopoly guy.

3273
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:35,960
That is, yeah, true.

3274
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,160
Maybe I'm just cranky.

3275
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:39,560
Yeah, maybe I'm just cranky, but I'm in no mood.

3276
03:34:39,560 --> 03:34:42,440
I'm in no mood for this horse play today.

3277
03:34:44,120 --> 03:34:45,320
Even going too long.

3278
03:34:45,320 --> 03:34:47,320
God, I'm sorry, audience.

3279
03:34:47,320 --> 03:34:49,240
I apologize for all this content.

3280
03:34:49,960 --> 03:34:50,920
It won't happen again.

3281
03:34:50,920 --> 03:34:53,880
All right, let's fucking be done.

3282
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:54,680
That's the end.

3283
03:34:54,680 --> 03:34:55,560
All right, goodbye.

3284
03:34:55,560 --> 03:34:56,280
This is the end.

3285
03:34:56,840 --> 03:34:57,560
Well, so long.

3286
03:34:59,480 --> 03:35:01,080
This is a really curt ending.

3287
03:35:01,720 --> 03:35:03,560
We hope you have a lovely day.

3288
03:35:03,560 --> 03:35:04,200
Die.
