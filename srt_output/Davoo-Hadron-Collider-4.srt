1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
One bag of green tea and one bag of perfect peach tea.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,520
I got one on Twitter criticizing my choice of tea brands.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,000
I was using a Bigelow brand of tea and some others, but he said, oh, you should get this

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,040
very patrician tea, so I'll have to go and look up what he said again, and buy that brand

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
even though it's more expensive.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
He said, that's better.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,240
I'll try it out, you know.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
And tea.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,640
I don't know if my voice sounds different right now, but I'm sick at the moment, but

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
I want that.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,520
It's that certain phase of sickness where you just feel really relaxed, if you know what

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
I mean?

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,000
Like, it was all tumultuous and tepid, what is it, it just felt like a tsunami inside

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,760
of me yesterday, and then I was super relieved once I finally got to my bed and just laid

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
down.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,280
And this morning, it's like a kind of sickness phase where everything feels like really relaxed

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,880
and good in a way, and my voice, which was a sore throat yesterday, so it sucked talking.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,040
Now it's just like reverberation in my voice, like I can really feel and hear like my sound

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,360
waves in my own body for some reason, and it's got like this warbliness to it because

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,440
of all the mucus and stuff.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,680
So right now it's actually really fun to talk, so I decided to do this, the only downside

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,640
of recording something in this current state is that I'm coughing a lot.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,920
But I'll have to see if I can edit all those coughs out, here we go.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,400
Was there a cough, or did I immediately begin the next sentence?

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,960
Because if it's the latter, then that means I competently edited this.

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,400
But yeah, I gotta keep drinking this tea.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,640
Now, I'm pretty sure that my voice is just gonna sound annoying to people, whereas to

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,200
me it sounds fun to talk, but I'm in my own head, literally, so it sounds fun from my

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
perspective.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,720
It's probably just annoying and nasally.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,360
But you know, hey, at least I'm finally recording another one of these episodes, when I said

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,720
I was gonna do them every two weeks, it's probably been like a month and a half now.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,400
Thing is though, I actually had recorded an episode of this well on time, like within

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,720
a week after doing the last one, but I didn't want to release it, and over the course of

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,600
the next couple of weeks I did like two more.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
A lot of it was like me trying to reiterate what I did in the first one, since I didn't

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,120
want to release the first one, but I ended up recording like three whole episodes, not

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:58,120
releasing any of them, because I'm kind of like, I'm now at the point of being known

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,040
on the internet to the degree to where I have fans now, and viewers now, where anything

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,960
I say will become part of this narrative that people are constructing in their heads about

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,560
me and the rest of the PCP, because when you're a fan of something, you learn all the

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,880
details and like you construct like a wiki in your own head about it, and there is indeed

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,520
an actual PCP wiki being made at the moment, and it's like weird because it's not how you

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,640
interact with other people, it's like you go on Discord, you talk to like the viewers

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,600
of the PCP and they'll talk to you and talk about you in a way that's very different

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,160
than how you talk to like a friend.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,040
A friend knows things about you, but then like when they explain you to other people

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,000
or like ask you to elaborate on something you said before, they like, how do I say this?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,560
It's like they're always interpreting you, if you know what I mean, like you'll say

50
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
something to a friend and they'll get something slightly different out of it than what you

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,520
said, like I don't know, the point is when it's like a viewer of yours who just sees

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,120
you as like a cool content creator, I feel like they sort of like take what you say

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,120
word for word in a way, like when you say something about yourself, they take it like

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,440
it's this sort of like fact, like it's this sort of, I don't want to use the word objective,

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,720
it's just like, they take what you're saying like it is like this structured thing, like

56
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,920
there's this physical detail that is what it is, and then they just sort of pile that

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,440
on to the other facts that they know about you, and when they explain you to someone

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,640
else, they'll like explain it sort of like word for word, very similarly to how you explained

59
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,800
it to them or how you explained it in a podcast, they explain you the way they would explain

60
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,080
allure in a video game or something, and you know, that's fine, it's just weird at first

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,200
because I'm not used to that, and it means that you know, I need to like change the way

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,280
that I explain myself to people, you know, like, I mean, you know, fuck, these people

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,200
give me money, and also give me viewership and attention, and it means I can post anything

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,760
I want on Twitter, and someone's gonna like like it or respond to it, so it's perfectly

65
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,120
well worth it, I'm not saying it makes me uncomfortable, I'm just saying it would make

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,400
me uncomfortable if I shared the wrong information or said it the wrong way, and then people

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,040
sort of understood things weirdly, so yeah, I'm definitely not as just like freely open

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,080
with shit as like Digi is, you know, where it's like Digi will just like mention his

69
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,680
mom and his dad, you know, maybe even drop their names sometimes, show their pictures

70
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,320
on screen, you know, I don't know, I'm not as open about things as he is, but that's

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,680
fine, you know, the point is that's why I was like hesitant to make an episode of this

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,400
show for a while because I just didn't think of anything I wanted to talk about that wasn't

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,680
just a bunch of like deeply personal shiz, but now I just went on like a one week sort

74
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,080
of vacation, yeah, a vacation, me going to see my new girlfriend thing, I was calling

75
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,880
her my squiggle in the first couple episodes because I didn't want to like, I don't know,

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,240
it's again trying to be like secretive with information, but at some point it's like,

77
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,800
no, I don't give a shit, you know, but the point is, I had a lot of like things happen

78
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
or things I thought about because I was in a different environment, so I, you know, was

79
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
self reflecting in different ways. So on the plane ride back, I wrote like a whole bunch

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,520
of notes for things I want to talk about on this show. So here we go. So, you know, the

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,640
first day I was there, we like went because like we just had like a little like hotel

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,800
room for us since like she doesn't have any space in her house. So, you know, we just

83
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,520
ran out like a hotel and I guess it's more like a motel. The point is, you know, it's

84
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,600
like this little cheap kind of dingy place. And we went to Walmart and we bought like some

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,920
food and we bought some like paper plates and like plastic forks. And I believe we cooked.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,600
What was the thing we ate on the first? Oh, yeah, we just ate like a like a frozen dinner,

87
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,680
Alfredo stoffers type of thing. And we shared that. And it was like, as I was doing all this,

88
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,920
I was like, man, this feels really like ghetto, poor white trash. But I'm like really excited

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,320
about all of this stuff. And I was telling her, you know, as as we were munching down on the

90
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:39,280
Alfredo, that all of these cheap, shitty amenities really excite me all the time. Even when I

91
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,000
think about them, but particularly when I have them, like like like on the plane when, you know,

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,920
in coach, the flight attendants will come by be like, Hey, do you want to drink? And I'll say,

93
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,680
yeah, I want some spray because my stomach's killing me. I want some Sprite. So she's like,

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,080
okay, she pulls out a little tiny miniscule plastic cup and pulls out a can of Sprite and pours it

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,280
in there with some ice. And I'm like, I get so excited about how minimalist and cheap it is.

96
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,520
Because it's like not in a saving money sort of way. But in a, it makes me and what I was telling

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,200
my girl is that it makes me reflect on it makes me think about how advanced our society is that

98
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,920
that with no money at all with with so little money, you have things that are this good, you know,

99
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,800
used to be if you were like quote unquote minimum wage equivalent in say the 1920s, you'd be like

100
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,960
whatever you'd be eating would have all sorts of terrible germs and probably some bug wings

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,520
inside of it, you know, that kind of thing. Like, it makes me so excited that we have all this

102
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,560
technology that can can make something that's so cheap and yet is so competent and functional,

103
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,040
like a Stofer's meal, you know, like we have all these preservatives that make for more efficient

104
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,280
transit. And we have, you know, freezing technology, that's like a recent invention that

105
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,080
allows it to stay fresh longer. And we have microwave technology that she didn't get invented

106
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
until the 80s, by the way, I didn't know that. But like, did you was like, Hey, did you know that

107
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
you know that like, microwaves didn't exist until the early 80s. And I was like, wait,

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
what? And he was like, yeah, I asked my parents. And I was like, well, I'll ask my parents. And

109
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,560
they said, yeah, and I was like, wow, the 80s. So me and her wouldn't have been able to have this meal

110
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,440
even 30 years ago, right? And like plastic forks and plastic plates, it's like, they're so cheap

111
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,360
and yet so effective. And when I think about the rest of time, the rest of human civilization

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,200
throughout history and most other places in the world, even today, the fact that we have so much

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,880
stuff for so little money makes me so hyped about like our economy and our civilization. And I was

114
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
just like, it makes me so excited. It just makes me go like, yeah. And she was like, how are you not

115
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
an optimist when you think like that? Because like, because she like, she says like, I'm an optimist

116
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,840
and stuff. And you're all like you and your friends, you and your PCP friends are all like

117
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,520
cynics, you're all like cynical and pessimistic. And I'm like, and that was a good question.

118
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,800
Like, I don't identify as an optimist, really. I was thinking about it. And the conclusion that came

119
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,360
to you is that I don't need optimism to be in a good mood. Like the thing is, is that I'm pessimistic

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,560
and cynical about like people in general, like, like any person, if I don't know you as a person,

121
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,960
then I'm just going to assume you're like terrible at things and you're going to fail and that you

122
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,160
aren't going to be smart, you know. And you know, I know plenty of people personally who I just don't

123
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,400
like think are like that good at anything. And therefore you're like, yeah, you're kind of

124
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,520
not you're not you're not useful, you know. But then like me myself, I value myself immensely,

125
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,360
like I think of myself as really competent. And I think that I myself can survive and be good.

126
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
And then I know all these people around me who I surround myself with,

127
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,240
who I also think are really good. So I think of like really good people as like a minority,

128
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
but that I, that I can work with that, like the amount of good people that there are,

129
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
I can associate myself with them and then things can be good, you know, I guess, I guess that's what

130
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,760
I think. I don't surround myself with people who I think are shitty, you know, I win when some group

131
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,040
or some entity or some association starts to piss me off. I disassociate myself with it. I don't

132
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,080
want to deal with that. I only surround myself with people that are good. People that aren't annoying.

133
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,240
So many times on the internet, I'll have like, like on Twitter, you know, there'll be people

134
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,280
like Jesse, especially who will complain about what shitty annoying people are saying on Twitter.

135
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,200
And I'm like, I don't follow shitty annoying people on Twitter. I unfollow them if they get

136
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,400
annoying or shitty. But Jesse, like, you know, I guess he's just sort of like a born cleanup crew

137
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,120
for human civilization. He can't help but surround himself with all this filth, this human trash,

138
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,840
and he just has to rage against it constantly. Like he's definitely that kind of person.

139
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't want to deal with that. I don't want to try and fix the world, try to fix stupid people.

140
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,680
So I'm just over here only being with good people. Oh man, okay. I'm realizing my head is pretty

141
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,560
stuffy right now. I am like talking very circularly, saying um a lot, repeating my words a lot to try

142
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,160
and finish my sentences. I'm definitely not very coherent, especially after like a week. You know,

143
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,400
my head is just kind of out of it. But you know, oh well, at least it's content. Feeling like doing

144
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,280
some content. Okay, um, oh yeah, you know, like, I guess part of why I'm why I think so positively

145
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,560
about cheap amenities is that like, like when I got interested in economics a couple years ago,

146
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
like when I read when I listened to the audiobook of Basic Economics by Thomas Soule,

147
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,640
and I was all like, dude, this book is super cool. And it talks about like, you know, just how

148
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,080
just how fragile and special our current modern economy is, like it really goes against the

149
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,480
tide of what human civilization is by default. And yet at the same time, if you just have the

150
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,000
right kind of society that values, you know, personal freedom and like personal property

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,320
and respect towards one another and trust in one another, then wealth sort of just happens,

152
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:30,000
you know, like if you have a society that's that's safe and trusting and free and individuals can

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,120
keep what they have and earn what they and earn what they have, people just sort of become great,

154
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,480
like society can become great if you're if you're a morally good society, whatever morally good

155
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,600
means this week. And yet it's just not normal, like that takes a lot of effort to happen. But

156
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,760
when it happens, it happens really fucking well. And like, I believe Basic Economics goes into like

157
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,520
one little historical thing that happened in the late 80s, I believe, maybe the early 80s. And I've

158
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,520
heard a number of like people talk about it on YouTube and stuff that there were some USSR

159
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:13,360
officials who took their first visit to America. And the moment that like really like blew them away

160
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,480
was when they went into a grocery store in Texas, you know, they'd seen all the statues and shiz,

161
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,400
they'd seen all like the crazy buildings that we've built when I'm sure they have crazy buildings

162
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,960
too. So they were like, yeah, whatever, you know, but when they saw a grocery store,

163
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,880
just a normal ass grocery store, they were blown away. And like one of them said that like that

164
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,840
was the moment where like my my last vestige of faith in communism went away, or at least our

165
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,320
country specifically, because they were like, dude, like in our country, people they have to

166
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,160
line up for hours just to get some shitty bread, you know, like like the amount of stuff in this

167
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,400
store beats what our highest ranking officials and our highest elites have access to. And it's so

168
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,640
cheap. And it's so neatly arranged. It's so well lit. It's so colorful. There's so much of it.

169
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,040
Every shelf is filled with the stuff. And it's so much variety. And it's so normal. All these people

170
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,840
are just walking in, not feeling special at all. This is this is accessible to normal frigging

171
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,520
people in this country. Anyone can walk in and pretty much anyone could afford a meal from this.

172
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,760
And they could get a meal of pretty much anything they want.

173
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,360
You know, I guess I'm just always thinking about the other dimensions beyond me, you know, I try to

174
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,720
like to think about things from other people's perspectives. So when I see a thing that it

175
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
like cost a little bit of money, I think about how much value would be to have to be to someone to

176
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,480
like, who is from Africa and shiz, you know, shiz, I keep saying shiz today. And I also,

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,840
whenever I see something with technology, I think I specifically think George Washington being with

178
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,000
me and me showing it off to him being like, dude, George Washington, this whole, this whole like

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,880
freedom constitution thing, you helped create, you know, this country of America, United States

180
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,080
of America. We did all this, we made, you know, with the help of some other countries here and

181
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,040
there, we made all this like cool stuff. And we have all this technology and, you know, be like,

182
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,640
I want to know what your reaction would be, you know, like, I'd love to see the, I always think

183
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,440
about the reaction that someone from 100 years ago would think if they saw it. And then 250

184
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
years ago, we'd think if they saw it, but most likely George Washington, that's the main one,

185
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,680
who I'd want to show stuff. You know, imagine just like you have George Washington, you know,

186
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,800
it's a comedy family friendly movie where he gets sucked into the future into 2017. And, you know,

187
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,280
you have to like, you got to go to like a coals and be like, have a montage of like getting them

188
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,360
out of all those robes and putting them in like a, you know, like a t-shirt with a jacket. Guy

189
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,480
to like, you know, just take off the dang wig, just going to go bald today, man, you know, go to

190
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,280
the dentist, get some like actual teeth, get some dentures and shiz, you know, and be like,

191
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,240
yeah, now try to talk with like modern dialect and blah, blah, blah, you know.

192
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,640
I feel like there's just, when you're sick, there's like mucus in your brain too. So like,

193
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,800
your like thoughts have to kind of blow in order to open up the passageway to get to the other

194
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,280
parts of your brain that control what you're saying. I don't know if you can tell, but I am a

195
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:30,400
deliberately slurping more slurperly so that you can like tell that I'm slurping. I know that like

196
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
radio people do that with like say like holding a piece of paper, like like Rush Limbaugh does that,

197
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
where he's like, okay, so, you know, there's some certain things that were in the news today,

198
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,520
and I printed them out and he'll do this and be like, when he like reads the papers that you know,

199
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,560
he's reading a paper, like if you pick up a piece of paper, it's going to sound like this,

200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,880
right? But he makes it go like this, right? But then eventually like people were calling in being

201
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,680
like Rush, that's so annoying, why are you doing that? That's so unnecessary. And he's like, well,

202
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,120
fine. So eventually it got to the point where he's like, so there was something in the news today,

203
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:11,680
I printed it out. It says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

204
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,240
Man, I'm so glad my sore throat is gone, like there's no way I can be in a good mood when

205
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,160
my sore throat is over. There's nothing more annoying than a sore throat. Well, okay, headaches

206
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,720
are worse. I, you know, I just, I generally have good health, so I don't have to worry about things

207
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
being painful on my body. And so therefore, the things that do occasionally go wrong, like a sore

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,960
throat, makes me really sad. It's, I really hate not being able to talk. Yeah, so, you know,

209
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,120
like I'm sure most of you know that like Digi has talked about, like there was this period where

210
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,720
him and his family were poor. I think there was like a couple of periods where that was happening,

211
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,320
I'm not really sure. And like I was always assuming like that they were like, poor, poor, like, you

212
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,000
know, like, like shitty house life, terrible, poor and stuff. And I was like, yeah, you know, I've

213
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,640
never like been poor like that, you know, like I was, I've always been like, yeah, you know,

214
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,320
like our families just always like had our, you know, her finances together for the most part.

215
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,800
Um, but then, like I was in the car with him one point, like, like, like a month or two ago,

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,880
and like he was mentioning like, oh yeah, yeah, we were so poor, we were on food stamps for like

217
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,320
four months. And I was like, wait, and I was like, wait a second, like there were times where my

218
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,800
family was on food stamps for like two years. And we're not that, and most of the time before and

219
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,440
after that, we were only slightly better off than we were during that period. And like, even now,

220
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,040
my dad's business is successful and all, but we have to pay so much taxes. And we're like three

221
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,600
years behind on paying taxes, my family is. So it's almost like we don't have all that money for

222
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,640
the most part, you know, like amenities and spending and splurging is still very, very

223
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,800
thinly spread even today. I was like, wait, have I always been poor? I was like, but I guess by

224
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,040
other people's standards, I guess so. And did you was like, yeah, if you're, if you were on food

225
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,920
stamps and you were poor, and I was like, oh, and did you was like, you know, I mean, I guess part of

226
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,000
it is that when we were on food stamps, we were also living with like annoying relatives. And so

227
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,200
that was what made it miserable. And like, it just wasn't a good life situation. And I was like, okay,

228
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,240
that really explains it then, because it's like, no matter what's ever gone on with my family and

229
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
our finances, they, my parents have just always acted really calm, like they're always on top of

230
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
things. They never freak out. They're never, they're never like getting overwhelmed with stress.

231
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,720
You know, there's only been like a couple of times when my dad got a little bit mad at me

232
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,360
from like stress, he was like, okay, let's go like that kind of that kind of burst out outburst,

233
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,880
like that kind that that's, that's like the most mad by dad gets at things, you know,

234
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,040
my mom only ever gets mad at me when I waste something, like sometimes I'll throw out some

235
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,400
boiling water and she'll be like, why'd you throw out that boiling water? We could have done something

236
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
with it. And I'm like, I'm sorry, mom, I changed my mind about what I wanted to eat. And she'll be like,

237
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,440
like my, my parents, they got like married when they were like 33, and they had me their first

238
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,920
child when they were 34. So like, they were completely competent adults before they had

239
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,080
children. So, you know, they'd had marriages before, but they didn't have any kids. So like,

240
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,320
I was their first child. So like, that's the benefit of having kids when you're old is that

241
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,040
you're really mature. So I never felt like we were poor, like we always had our shit together.

242
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,480
That's the thing, you know, I never felt poor. I just felt like I couldn't have nice things,

243
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,320
you know, like, and recently, I've kind of sort of gotten into Stefan Molyneux,

244
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,160
who's like this libertarian YouTube political guy. A lot of his modern videos are him going like,

245
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,160
oh, you know, Trump may be flawed, but the left is saying this about Trump, and it's completely

246
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,880
inaccurate. And you're just also completely daft. I can't believe you'd be like that. And then,

247
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,280
as I continue to reiterate the point over and over again, I start acting really raspy. I start

248
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,440
doing this really raspy voice where I stick my teeth out. I just keep saying the same thing over

249
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
and over again. Getting raspy, I'm raspy, I'm getting even raspy. The left is so retarded,

250
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,000
you're all put to altars. And then I get back to the topic and I have this very concerned look

251
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,080
on my face and continue with the subject and I never edit my videos. It's just one long take

252
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
of me being in front of my microphone and bobbing back and forth in front of my blue background.

253
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,000
and never editing out anything I ever say, and brilliantly I never say um for the most

254
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,240
part and I never stutter or have long gaps, I just keep talking which is probably exactly

255
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,960
why I reiterate my points over and over again and have to go into that recipe voice in order

256
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,320
to fill in all the space, I don't know why I don't just fucking edit my videos.

257
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,880
But he's been doing them for a fucking long time, I introduced him to Digi saying hey,

258
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,840
this is what I expect your body of work to be like in 10 years from now, because Devon

259
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:07,880
Molyneux has done these like podcast video things since 2005, like he was on YouTube

260
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,240
at the very beginning of YouTube right, I think he started his podcast before YouTube

261
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,680
was around, he has 3500 podcasts, like he does like multiple every week, and they're

262
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,320
usually like long, they range from 30 minutes to 2 hours every time, unbelievably prolific

263
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,920
guy, um okay, I really wanted to talk about Devon Molyneux because I find him fascinating

264
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,120
and like his early content is not really about current issues or at least not the ones I

265
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,520
listen to, a lot of his stuff is, his early stuff especially is just like theoretical

266
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,280
philosophy about you know like libertarian ideals of like hey what if the state didn't

267
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,200
exist or what if the state was like this instead of this, you know, and it's pretty good stuff,

268
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,960
a lot of it is definitely things I haven't heard before, it's really terrible audio quality

269
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,160
in the beginning, but it's interesting stuff, and there's one video of his, there's one

270
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,880
of his first YouTube videos, probably like his 250th podcast or so, but anyway it's

271
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
one of his first videos, and he's just in his car talking about stuff, talking about

272
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,240
like Nazis and like you know, can you, like okay, you can't blame a soldier that was said

273
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,920
shoot them or I'm gonna shoot you, and you can't blame the generals because the general

274
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,360
was told hey tell that guy to shoot him or I'm gonna tell someone to shoot you, and

275
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,920
you can't blame the marshals because the marshal was told to do this and that, now there were

276
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:34,080
plenty of Nazis who decided to rise up the ranks in Nazism and who like did more than

277
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,200
they had to, so you can blame them, but they didn't necessarily know that their government

278
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,560
was that evil, not at the beginning, you know, and even other people, like how many people

279
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,120
can you really blame, and what Stefan Malinu said was that the only, in my opinion, the

280
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,440
only people who are perfectly guilty are the intellectuals, we're the philosophers, the

281
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,320
people who sat in their colleges and their campuses and in their homes and just wrote

282
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,840
ideas, and their ideas were evil, that kind of thing, and anyway, I swear I'm gonna bring

283
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,000
this back to the whole me being not with money in my family thing, he's like, you know, so

284
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,160
many of these philosophers back in the day who spurred on Nazism were trying to, were

285
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,920
falling into a sin that many philosophers do, a mistake that many philosophers make, is

286
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,440
that they were trying to normalize the way that they were raised into an ideology that

287
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,480
the world could live by, all of these philosophers, many of them were raised by Lutheran families,

288
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Lutheran fathers who had a very strict, harsh, you know, uncunning, unforgiving style of

289
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,160
parenting that was very strict, very harsh, very punishing, and so when they took to their

290
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,840
books and they took to their writing, they tried to like come up with a world philosophy,

291
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,720
a set of rules by which society could operate that reflected the way that they were raised,

292
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,040
they were trying to normalize the way that they were raised, trying to rationalize the

293
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,440
mistakes and crimes and sins of their parents as something that is a moral good or a moral

294
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,840
necessity, things like many philosophers fall into this trap, Ain Rand herself couldn't

295
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,640
avoid falling into this mistake, so I, you know, listened to that and it made me reflect

296
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,040
on myself and like, okay, well, how was my view of the world influenced by the way I

297
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,840
was raised and like, you know, because we'd never had money really, we never had like,

298
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,920
we always had enough money to be just fine and be comfortable, but never enough money

299
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,920
to like buy nice things, and like, I was really brought up in this like mentality that if

300
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,480
you want something nice, you have to work to make it happen, like if you want something

301
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,880
cool, you have to put in extra effort to earn the money to make it, if you want something

302
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,200
to happen, you just gotta make it happen yourself, that no one's gonna come in and just give

303
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,840
it to you, you know, and like, as I've grown up and had different life experiences, I've

304
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,080
been adjacent to like, people who it's like, their parents just give them a friggin' like

305
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,240
beach house or something or a little apartment condo next to a lake with a boat, like here,

306
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,160
you guys can have that, you just got married, have it, and it's like, wow, you know, I don't

307
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,920
have any, we don't have any like rich people in our family, and like, you know, my family

308
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,680
isn't poor enough to get like, that many government amenities, and whenever we do,

309
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,640
my dad's goal is to make enough money to where we don't have to have that, you know, when

310
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,760
we were on food stamps, my dad's one of his biggest priorities was make enough money so

311
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,440
we can buy all our own food, with our own money, I mean, we'll take advantage of handouts

312
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,560
if we're given, if we're given them, right, but you know, the idea is, you know, try to

313
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,400
not be dependent on that, and so I really think that that's kind of like where my mentality

314
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,040
comes from, of like, you shouldn't expect to be given stuff, you know, like, you just

315
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,400
have to make it happen on your own, and like, you know, as an adult, I can reflect on that

316
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,040
like mentality and be like, yeah, but like most people don't think exactly like that,

317
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,600
like a lot of people are like, you know, hey, if you're given something, you'll do something

318
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,040
nice with it, you know, if you're just given something for free, you're not just gonna

319
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,840
be lazy, you're gonna like put effort into like making that gift worth something, and

320
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,360
those people are right, you know, most people, if given a handout, are gonna be responsible

321
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,920
with it, but like my default mentality of things is, you can't expect to be given anything,

322
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,360
like not that it's wrong to be given something, but like, you shouldn't expect it, like, like,

323
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,200
like, as a teenager, learning about how like jobs work, and how like benefits and like

324
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,640
pensions work, I was like, why would you be given money after you stopped working, like,

325
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,560
why would you still be getting paid after you stopped doing the job that you're getting

326
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,280
paid for, you know, like, what's, what's the point of that, like, why, why is that

327
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,120
normal, right? And when I first heard of benefits as a thing, like as a kid, like, oh man,

328
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,960
a great dental plan, a great health plan, you know, they give you a car, I'm just like,

329
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,400
why not just give you more money? Like, why do they have to buy these things for you?

330
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Why don't if they have this extra cash to spend on you, just give you the cash, you

331
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,560
know, just give you the money and let you decide what to do with it. And like, I'm always

332
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,280
thinking, oh man, if you get this, then what's it being taken out of, you know, like, if

333
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,880
you're given a car with your job, that just means you're going to get paid less in your

334
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,200
actual wages, probably equivalent to exactly the price of that car. But like, I talk to

335
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,960
my friends and stuff, not my PCP friends, they're all smart, but like, normie friends,

336
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,160
like, people who I've encountered in my life, and they don't, it doesn't seem like that

337
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,800
crosses their minds, you know, like, or like, oh man, this business doesn't give us a dental

338
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,200
plan, they can't afford it or whatever. And it's like, yeah, and like, if they gave you

339
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
a dental plan, they just pay you less money, you know, like, because like, anything they

340
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,120
give you is money, they're not giving you. Why don't they just give you the money and

341
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,800
then you can decide to go to the dentist yourself, right? And I know it's because like, with

342
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,040
insurance specifically, it's like, if more people get insured by the same place all at

343
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,400
once, it's more efficient, you know, obviously, there's lots of detailed economic ramifications

344
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,520
that make way more sense. But just my I'm just talking about my like, you know, worldview,

345
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:17,160
the way it was said, as a young age was like, you know, if I'm given something by my parents,

346
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,240
it's going to come out of somewhere, I was made very acutely aware of that, you know.

347
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,320
So whenever I think about whenever I like, you know, I mean, stuck in an airport all

348
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,920
night and CNN is in every single room, and they're debating the value and merits of like,

349
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,320
this government program that gives people health care versus this government program

350
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,000
that gives people health care versus this government program, it gives people this

351
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,480
and that, and gives people this and that, I'm immediately thinking, well, at the cost

352
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,920
of what, what are we not getting as a result of paying for that, you're not just getting

353
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,800
the money out of nowhere, is basically just coming out of taxes, right? And yeah, the

354
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,440
people who like, are the richest are the ones who are going to get taxed the most, but that

355
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,640
just means they're going to be spending less money on stuff, and spending money stimulates

356
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,840
the economy, which helps everyone. So it's like, you know, like, I just sort of naturally

357
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,040
assume that things are going to come from somewhere. And that's why when I listened to

358
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,160
Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, and it said exactly the way that my worldview was, I was

359
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,520
that I got so excited about that. That's why I love that book so much. It just, it just,

360
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:23,240
it just, it just sort of gives like this structure and like, this like actual factualism to like

361
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,040
the way that I see the world already, you know, and I don't know how flawed that book

362
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,600
is. I don't know how many people have poked holes in its logic, but it seems it just makes

363
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,160
so much sense to me that that's why it's my favorite book. Well, certainly my favorite

364
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,200
nonfiction book. But yeah, again, you know, I try to be like open minded about things.

365
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,200
And I've sort of, you know, like, again, as I said, when you give people stuff, two out

366
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,240
of three times, they're going to do something good with it, you know, like think about the,

367
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,080
the parable from the Bible, right? Where the parable that Jesus tells his followers is

368
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,680
okay, there's this dude who owns like this, like this, this is like a real estate guy

369
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,400
has a big house, has a lot of money, has like some farmland, and he's going to go out on

370
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,000
a trip and he's got three servants and he's like, okay, a servant, I'm going to go out

371
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,800
on this trip, but I want you to do stuff with my money, do stuff with my resources, right?

372
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,960
So one servant, he gives 10 shillings to like, okay, do stuff with these 10 shillings, you

373
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,680
know, benefit my, my estate and you over there, the second guy, I'm giving you five shillings.

374
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,600
Okay, now you over there, the third guy, I'm going to give you one shilling, all three of

375
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,600
y'all do stuff with that money, make it, make it productive, um, do good stuff with it and,

376
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,520
you know, I'll, I'll be back. So when the dude left and came back, he was like, all right,

377
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,320
guys, the three of you, show me what you did. And the first guy's like, dude, I invested

378
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,400
the 10 shillings and now it's 20. The second guy's, dude, I invested the five shillings,

379
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,440
now it's 10. And he's like, you two are awesome, go to heaven, basically is what he says. It's

380
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,400
like, you get to have lots of reward. But then the one shilling guy, he was like, oh, sir,

381
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,720
you know, I know that you're all harsh and shit, and you're all like judgmental and unforgiving.

382
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,080
So I didn't want to risk losing it. So I just buried it, you know, and so here it is, I dug

383
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,880
it out, you know, it's got some dirt on it, but I hope you still like it. And, and, and the dude is

384
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,400
like, you're such a fuck boy. For first of all, don't talk to me like that. Like, what do you

385
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,240
mean I'm judgmental? Oh, shit. I mean, don't complain. Goddamn, Jesus Christ.

386
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,800
But also, you're a big lazy butthole, just sitting on all that money, you should take a risk, you

387
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,440
should try and be responsible with it. Don't lays out, I'm sending you to hell, or what he

388
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,840
says in the metaphor is, you're gonna get punished for that, go into the fucking dungeon or whatever.

389
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,320
So like, you know, it's Jesus telling the world that like, you know, if you're given something,

390
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,760
do something with it, take a chance, you know, any gift you have, be it a talent or money.

391
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,880
But the thing is, and I just realized this five minutes ago, which is why I told this parable

392
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,600
to you guys, is that this kind of shows that, yeah, two out of three people are gonna be good.

393
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,040
Like, overall, that dude's estate profited immensely from that, from those handouts.

394
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,120
Like, even if he'd given all three of them the same amount of shillings, like if you'd given

395
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,280
them 10 to each of them, he would have broke even on those last 10, but he would have made

396
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,560
20 shillings in profit on those first two guys who actually are good.

397
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,120
So, you know, like when you think about that, it have a harder time just thinking of government

398
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,840
handouts as these things that just promote poverty and shit. Really, the reason why government

399
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,400
handouts do that is because they're designed to do that on top of just being handouts. I don't know

400
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,160
if you guys know what like conservatives, but especially libertarians say all the time is that

401
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,800
if you're given stuff, then you're gonna be dependent on being given stuff, and therefore,

402
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,320
it's gonna be harder to make stuff for yourself. And also, those handouts incentivize you to not

403
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,320
do work, so therefore, you're gonna become less productive and you'll be even more dependent on

404
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,280
it. And so, people are like, yeah, we need to stop handouts, but I'm like, why not just do handouts

405
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:06,120
that don't encourage not working, right? Like, disability benefits. I have an uncle,

406
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:11,640
uncle bill, because everyone has an uncle bill. My uncle bill, like, my uncle bill was a construction

407
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,760
foreman and stuff or something like that. He's a construction dude, laying down concrete, and he

408
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,320
like destroyed his back doing that. He had to get surgery, and his back is all sensitive and like

409
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,160
easy to make him miserable at all times. So, he got disability for that. And it's like, you know,

410
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,720
like, I guess what I've been told by like other members of my family is that dude, like, he could

411
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,360
just be a foreman. Like, he could just tell people what to do and like not lift a finger. He is so

412
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,840
skilled. He knows his shit so well that he could easily make bank just showing up at a construction

413
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,720
site and pointing at what to do. And he wouldn't have to lift a finger. He could be doing like,

414
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,320
like physically, it wouldn't be that much worse than just sitting in his apartment, which is what

415
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,360
he does, right? Um, it's not like he does nothing. He is like a hobbyist dude. He does do some work

416
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,880
for people. He does like mixing music and painting stuff. But, you know, none of it is like making

417
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,480
him money. Um, he just lives off the disability for like, last, I don't know, 15 years or so.

418
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,120
Um, and he said that like, well, if I was a foreman, people would be screwing things up,

419
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,280
and I wouldn't be able to resist going up and grabbing something myself and then destroying my

420
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,440
back. Whatever. But like the point is, like, he's, I think he's like outright said, you know, if I

421
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,000
was better, if I did work and I wouldn't get the disability, and therefore, you know, my, my

422
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
income would be less secure. And it's like this thing, you know, it really encourages you to be

423
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,560
like that. Um, that's, that's how the disability works. It's like, if you're basically government

424
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,600
handouts, at least in America are like, if you're useless, then you get free stuff, you know, so it

425
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:50,520
incentivizes uselessness. So the thing is, okay, that's a obvious problem with handouts, right?

426
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,160
And like, you know, people talk about how like in the inner cities, in American cities, that's

427
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,000
where like handouts are the most pervasive, and that's where people are the most poor, and then

428
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,400
there's crime and stuff. And so it's like, you know, like, oh man, all these handouts have like

429
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,800
ruined cities and stuff, and it brings down the overall quality of life in America, on average.

430
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,120
And it's like, okay, but like, are those handouts disastrous, just because they're handouts, or

431
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,760
are they disastrous because they're disastrous handouts with bad ideas stacked on top of the

432
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,680
idea of just being free shit, right? So what I'm getting at is that people have been talking about

433
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,000
the idea of universal basic income, which is something I've talked about on my DeVugos

434
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,440
to Saturn channel recently, which is everyone gets a thousand bucks in their bank account

435
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,240
at the end of the month, every month, everyone gets it. Like each social security number gets

436
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:50,360
a thousand dollars in your bank account every month, no matter who you are or what you do.

437
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,320
Like even if you're a felon, even if you're a billionaire, right, it doesn't just go to poor

438
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:01,320
people. So if you're poor, you don't have to worry about making money and then losing the thousand

439
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,560
dollars, right, you're going to get it no matter what. So like it's going to be useless to all

440
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,240
those billionaires, right, like it's going to be wasting the money on the billionaires because

441
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,880
they don't need the money, right? But the point is the reason to give it to everyone is so that you

442
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,000
don't have the bureaucratic overhead of making sure you're not too rich, right? And you don't have to

443
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,560
make people afraid to become independent. If you give someone something no matter what,

444
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,880
then they won't be afraid to continue being useless. And of course, when you hear something

445
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,200
like that, you're like, okay, plenty of people will just never work ever. I'm pretty sure Ben has

446
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,960
told me like, yeah, if I was given a thousand dollars every month, I just wouldn't do anything.

447
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,480
And I guess that's fair enough. But I would do stuff with that money. I would still work.

448
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,040
And I know Digi would still work, I think. So that there we go. Once again, two out of three,

449
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,960
right? Now, can the economy survive if two out of three people are productive? I don't know.

450
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,720
But I'm just saying like, I find that to be an idea worth trying out or something. Try it,

451
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,760
you know, like just just do it. Come on, like all we got to do is just upend our entire economy

452
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,480
and legal system for just a couple of years. Just try it out, guys. Geez. God, I'm so annoying in

453
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,240
this one. I'm doing all these stupid voices. I'm the I'm the new Stefan Malinu, man. And people

454
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,080
have talked about how like, let's say you are a loser who like, you know, blows your money on alcohol

455
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,880
or weed every month. And like, you can't get a job because you're completely incompetent.

456
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,120
And in our current society, those people will probably either end up on the streets,

457
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,200
or more likely just end up crashing in their family or friends' couches forever

458
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,440
and ruin everyone's lives. They're their own and the people around them. They'll make everyone

459
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,240
miserable and they'll be shitty people. And what I've heard people say when defending universal

460
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,760
basic income is that it will take away those people's excuses to not do anything. Because like,

461
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,760
here's the thing, you know, in our current reality without universal basic income, if like,

462
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,480
the dude's sister who he's sleeping with is like sleeping, you know, on her couch and stuff,

463
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,040
he's like, I can't do anything. And she's like, dude, just go get a job, like clean up,

464
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,400
go try out for jobs and stuff. And he's like, no, I can't do it. I have no money. I can't do

465
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,240
anything. I can't afford new clothes. I can't afford to like shave every day. I can't afford

466
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,360
to like get a haircut. And you know, I can't afford shampoo. So like, how am I supposed to get a job

467
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,480
anyway? You know, I can't afford a car. I can't afford this. I'm completely out of I'm completely

468
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,520
out of resources, man. I can't do anything, man. You know, that's the that's the kind of excuse

469
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,640
that some people give. But in the reality with universal basic income, she can be all like,

470
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,520
dude, you're going to get $1,000 on the first. All right. So use that money to clean up. Okay.

471
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,960
And if you don't do it, I'm kicking you out. So it sort of like takes. Yeah, sure. $1,000 can

472
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,480
be people's excuse to not work. But it can take away your excuse that you're completely helpless,

473
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,200
right? It takes away your excuse that you have no power, that you have no resources,

474
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,880
that you have no choices. And I'm like, yeah, that makes that makes perfect sense. Again,

475
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,920
so many of government handouts are bad because they like give you something very specific. And

476
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,400
the government themselves decides what to give you and when and how. And then they give you all

477
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,720
these rules that you have to follow in order to do it, you know, they so it's like the government

478
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,440
trying to control you, which is obviously what the government wants to do. The reason why government

479
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,400
handouts are so popular with every government is not because they want to be generous to people.

480
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,400
They do it because it's an amazingly convenient way to control people's lives and the corral people

481
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,360
and the living the lifestyle that the bureaucrats want us to live. The fact that it's so politically

482
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,280
popular is what makes it so pervasive. I mean, obviously, the government would just tell us what

483
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,480
to do, you know, in a completely totalitarian way if they could. But that's politically unpopular,

484
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,120
you want to win elections like that. But handouts with a bunch of rules and the shit is a way to

485
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,760
tell people what to do and tell people how to live. That is politically popular, you know,

486
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,160
every politician can come up and be like, y'all, we're going to give you this free thing. And the

487
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,480
guy who is running against me who doesn't want to give you this free thing, he wants you to die.

488
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,080
So don't vote for me instead. And those people are able to win elections, you know. I mean,

489
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,200
you may think that in America a couple months ago, those people did not win. But even the

490
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,320
Republicans who won this time aren't saying we're not going to give you stuff. They're just saying

491
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,560
we're going to give you something slightly different than what you're getting right now, you know.

492
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,640
So, you know, there you go. It's still basically the same thing. There's no one winning elections,

493
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,480
even in America, who is outright saying we're going to give you less stuff. Even like hardcore

494
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,920
conservative people, like Ted Cruz, I don't think ever says let's give people less stuff.

495
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,680
He's just saying let's clean up the bureaucracy in the stuff giving committee. And obviously,

496
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm not saying we should stop giving people stuff at all either because people are dependent on it.

497
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,720
You know, it may be a fucked situation that our government is in, that our society is in,

498
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,000
but you can't just stop doing it because people need it. It's like government bullshit,

499
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,200
societal bullshit is like a game of Jenga where you have all these blocks of bullshit that have

500
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,640
stacked up. But if you can't just dismantle it, you know, haphazardly, if you just take out the

501
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,520
bottom, if you just start taking it apart, it's going to collapse and cause a 9-11 all over everyone's

502
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,160
face. So, you know, if you want to dismantle it, you have to do it slowly and know exactly how to

503
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,400
do it so that not too many people die. I'm calling it, I'm saying die that way because there was

504
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,360
someone on CNN who was like, you know, if we were peeling, replace Obamacare the way that Trump

505
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,160
is saying it, people are going to die. People are going to die, okay? There was some doctors who said

506
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,880
that like if we take away Obamacare, some people are going to die. They're going to die. They're going to die.

507
00:43:48,680 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm going to be so impressed if people can get through this without like their eyes watering

508
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
from the annoyance of my voice. You know, when I was in the airport being all sick and stuff

509
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,200
and sneezing sometimes, my sneeze are so loud that there's always like at least someone who will say

510
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,360
bless you. Like it's so loud that like there's always going to be like it's like like it's going

511
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,000
to turn like five people's heads and whoever says bless you first is going to say it and I'm going

512
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,320
to be like thank you because I sneeze so loud whether or not I'm sick. What the hell was I talking

513
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,920
about? Oh yeah, yeah, the money with the you know, there's one last thing I want to say about it. Like

514
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,480
I think one of the moments that really started to shift my perspective about the idea of giving

515
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,960
people free stuff was when I watched Scarface all by myself on VHS in my room because that's

516
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,640
something I do. You know, my whole why don't I like movies series which is on my main channel

517
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,160
is a reflection of something that I used to do a lot which is just look at my

518
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,480
collection of VHS tapes and then sometimes randomly watch one. So that's how I saw Scarface.

519
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,080
And my favorite scene from the movie, my favorite moment, my favorite line is toward the end when

520
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,040
Scarface is in his giant you know gold studded jacuzzi just hanging out being topless being

521
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,680
naked probably underneath the bubbles and like his girlfriend or whoever it's been a while I only

522
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,480
watched it once but like you know the lady person is all like you know trying to like talk to him

523
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,080
or do a thing and Scarface is just Charles Foster canning it up to like no tomorrow he's just being

524
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:32,760
all like yo man like don't don't give me this shit bitch don't talk to me like that I'm I'm the best

525
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:41,560
I'm the goddamn go to I'm fucking don't I'm the best fucking fuck you you know he's being a total

526
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,360
asshole to her and she's like why are you being such an asshole he's like look at me see all this

527
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,320
I'm the look at me I'm obviously the best I made all this happen I sold coke and shot dudes in the

528
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:59,000
balls better than anybody so I earned my place on the throne and she just says I wish you had been

529
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,840
given your money I wish you'd been given your wealth instead of earning it because if you've

530
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,920
been given it you'd feel guilty and you'd feel an obligation to be nice with it you'd feel an

531
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,040
obligation to do good with it and then she like you know stormed off being all mad and stuff or

532
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:18,680
something like that and he's all just like you know and that's what happened and I was like

533
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:25,160
and I watched that scene and I was all like man yeah that's actually a good point when like

534
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,800
sure on one hand you can say that if someone earns something they're gonna be more responsible for it

535
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,040
and uh and if someone is given something they're gonna be irresponsible with it but sometimes

536
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,960
it can also work the exact opposite way where if you earn something you feel like oh well since I

537
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,560
earned it and I could do whatever I want in a minute but if you were given it you're like oh

538
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:48,280
shit I don't really deserve this I need to like do good with it and I'm like yeah that's a good point

539
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,480
okay that's enough of that topic you're listening to free to view radio

540
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,480
and now let's move on to the next subject I wrote on my uh my notes here so um you know my girl's

541
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,760
been like I don't want to call her okay her name is Nikki okay Nikki was telling me you know hey I want

542
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:15,000
to meet your friends like turn on you know the facebook messenger face cam chat app or turn on

543
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,400
audio call and then shove the phone in front of your friends I want to talk to them I want to

544
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,520
introduce me to them and I'm like no I don't know that'd be weird and she's like why do you

545
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:34,040
why don't you want to show me off me me me and I'm all like cuz they'd be weirded out by that

546
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,640
and she's like why and I'm like I don't know it's just how guys are geez you know it's like

547
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,200
digi specifically has even mentioned like yeah you know I don't I don't like it when guys show

548
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,480
off their girlfriends to me you know like if you show that to a bunch of dudes they're just gonna

549
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,040
be like oh fuck you all happy in a relationship go die on the washington memorial by landing on it

550
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:00,200
from an airplane ass first you know that kind of thing and but you know meanwhile if a girl shows

551
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,440
off her boyfriend or her friends it's like they're all like oh hey I'm so happy for you and I'm like

552
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,240
okay I guess that makes sense you know and so that's why I mean like like I only know you know like

553
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,080
specifically because digi specifically says I don't like it when guys show off their girlfriends I

554
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,400
mean like I'm not gonna do it to him I'm only like like look Nikki you'll meet them at some point you

555
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,960
know it'll just happen naturally she's like why doesn't it happen now what happened now I'm like

556
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:33,560
so meanwhile when I was visiting her for a week just now there was a day where like we went and

557
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,400
met a bunch of her friends and their family and stuff and I thought it was a fun time you know

558
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,160
we didn't talk much but you know they were all hanging out with each other and I was just sort

559
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,840
of there hugging the shit out of her and you know I was like okay cool you know and and we met them

560
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,440
and and and that was that but then the next day it turns out that like most of her friends hated me

561
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,320
like they were like they were mad at her for how I was quote unquote acting terribly or something

562
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,360
like I was specifically like not talking for the most part I was just trying to be quiet you know

563
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,120
so I didn't so that wouldn't be annoying you know like I don't know what these friends of nikkies

564
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,520
are like I don't know like what kind of topics they'd be interested in I'll just like sit here

565
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,400
and wait for them to like bring up a topic and then I'll I'll say things and and you know if they

566
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,440
ask me questions I'll answer and I'll be like okay now I'm asking the question of you in return you

567
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,840
know I didn't want to you know yeah I was just trying to be quiet you know I said things you know

568
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,560
I was like I told jokes here and there but for the most part I was quiet but turns out some of her

569
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,720
friends hated that they were like why wasn't he opening up why was he being so reclusive

570
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,640
but what really um took me aback was that uh like a couple of them were saying that I was like

571
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,760
we're telling her we're complaining to her that I'm like so egotistical and arrogant

572
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:56,440
and I'm like well that's true but it really took me aback that like it shows so easily

573
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,680
like I can just sit there not say a damn thing yet it still comes through so strongly apparently

574
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,960
like it really it really left a big impression on them in that regard and I thought I was being

575
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,360
really polite and I was being really polite but they were still they they apparently were like

576
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:18,120
stealing with rage at me about it like okay there was a part in the car where we were in the car

577
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,600
and like one of them not the one who was driving it wasn't her car but she was like in the front

578
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:29,240
seat in the shotgun and she was like putting on some pandora in the car and it was like a bunch

579
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:36,360
of like billboard top 40 pop songs for the most part and it was like um a weird rock cover of somebody

580
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,120
I used to know was playing and I was like huh and and I and I looked at niki and I was just like

581
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,320
man you know when the uh when the interesting musicality of this track is taken away I notice

582
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,080
how kind of stupid the lyrics are lol you know I just I just said that offhandedly and then um

583
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,320
like at another point they were playing drive by by train and I was like oh man niki you know I heard

584
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,120
I watched this one youtube review of this song it was like deconstructing how it's like in a way

585
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:10,920
the worst lyrics possible like like hefty bag to hold my love that's a weird way to express love

586
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,560
and I even mentioned like I'm really enjoying the song though I love the beat of it I'm enjoying it

587
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,240
at least sitting now I'm enjoying all this music you know it's a fun time we're having um I was

588
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,960
even complimenting the scenery of that we were driving through I'm like man all this countryside

589
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,320
and these buildings and how the roads are like brown instead of gray that's so cool because like

590
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:37,800
they're like it's like brown tarmac which was totally unique um so those music comments were

591
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:46,440
interpreted by her as quote belittling my music taste unquote and I was like oh shit I guess you're

592
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,600
right I didn't think about that you know I my main friends my primary friends are people who

593
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,040
we we do podcasts where we just shit on each other's opinions constantly and then we have a

594
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,880
little discord chat where we shit on each other's for our opinions constantly I'm so not used to that

595
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,160
you know like for me just like making critical statements of some piece of media that is put

596
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,360
in front of me is totally normal and so natural I don't think about how you know it could affect

597
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,080
people now I mean I do I do think about it I don't try to be an asshole like it's just that it was

598
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,680
the kind of song she was putting on she was putting like pop songs that I've heard already and I never

599
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,480
listen to pop music I'm talking about music that's so popular I've heard it like again somebody I

600
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,840
used to know number one song of 2012 drive by by train one of those songs that was like a big hit

601
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,200
and is still played consistently to this day I feel like everyone is entitled to a positive or

602
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:47,000
negative opinion of those musics of those songs and is totally of their right mind to express them

603
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,080
openly like if the friend if that girl was even putting on like a full album of something or

604
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,840
was putting on something that was a little bit more obscure was putting on something with a little

605
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:02,760
bit more like specificity to it wouldn't have said a damn thing because I would have known that it was

606
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,400
like special to her you know like she did put on a bunch of like like mid-2000s like Disney pop

607
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,600
and she said yeah I love 2000s Disney pop like I know she was being ironic with it but like no no

608
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:19,080
no she wasn't being ironic with it she was being self aware about that fact but she was being sincere

609
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:25,240
like I love that that era that style you know that I'm so nostalgic for and Nikki even was like

610
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:33,720
yeah I totally agree you know and all that pre 2010 Disney pop I'm totally down with so just that

611
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,320
level of personal affection I wouldn't have said any critical thoughts I would have only said positive

612
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,480
things right but when you're when it's drive by by train I'm it's completely okay they'll be like

613
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,200
lyrics in this song are stupid because like those those songs belong to everyone you know

614
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:57,960
so I I don't think I did anything wrong I honestly I stand by anything I said that day but

615
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,640
it is I'm not like I don't like have a grudge or anything I just find it really interesting how I

616
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,680
come off to people you know like it's okay that they get mad at me or whatever like they can have

617
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,800
their opinion of me and it I was I was sort of getting the vibe that they were mad more because

618
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,880
Nikki spent so much time with me on chat and audio call that she doesn't spend as much time with her

619
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,600
friends as she used to and they're like kind of upset about that so the fact that when they finally

620
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,080
met me I wasn't like eminently charming or anything and was in fact really awkward and quiet

621
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,040
probably you know they were probably getting ready to they were probably kind of ready to get mad so

622
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,800
you know that that's perfectly understandable you know again I'm not saying that people shouldn't

623
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,360
be like that because people like that I don't really care about their opinion of me at all

624
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,960
which I guess is kind of a problem I guess that's where the arrogance comes from but still I do think

625
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:56,760
it's really interesting because it just goes to show what a weird social circle I surround myself in

626
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,680
in the form of the pcp we're like oh yeah it was like a culture shock sort of the sort of thing you

627
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,800
know and by the way Nikki herself is not like that at all she was like yeah they're my friends are

628
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,200
totally overreacting you didn't do anything offensive at all and Nikki will tell me if I do

629
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,720
think that they're awkward or weird like she will be open with me about that uh but she stands by

630
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:24,760
everything I said so I think I'm fine but yeah it's just normies man people with normal uh music

631
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:33,800
taste is a thing okay well that's the gradual annoying petering out of that topic as well

632
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,680
let's see what's else on uh what else osos or else is on my notes here

633
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,880
you know I was uh I was kind of upset when when the last day of being over at my girl

634
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,960
met Nikki came I was like oh man now I gotta pack it up gotta go away and she was like really

635
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,520
upset about it she was like no and I was like yeah don't worry we're gonna see each other again

636
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,400
you know um but I was packing and I was like getting really sentimental about the week we'd

637
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:07,640
spent in this little tiny hotel and like I whenever I'm packing to like leave a place

638
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,680
that I know I'm not gonna come back to again I get really sentimental about it like I'm like

639
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,520
okay this is it this sock here is the last sock that I need to pack and once I'm done with this

640
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,560
I'm done with the sock packing and like oh man this piece of trash right here is the last

641
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,040
piece of trash in the apartment here we go and I like hold it above the trash can and I'm like

642
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,120
and I drop it I need like slow motion falls into the trash can and I'm like that's the end of the

643
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,240
trash you know and like um when I'm going out the door I'm like this is it this is the last I'm

644
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,840
gonna see of this room done done done and like when I um when I was moving when I was moving out of

645
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,600
my parents house to come in you know live in Virginia like um I just had this really like I

646
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,320
packed over the course of like two days and I like did it really methodically and was like yep

647
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,800
that's this is the end I even filmed my room right before I left I was like this is what my room

648
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,000
looks like you know and and when I was stepping out the door on the way to get to the airport I'm

649
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,920
like okay I actually filmed myself walking out the door and like filming the last shot the last

650
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,200
glimpse of my room the way that it looked before my sister moved into it and made a mess out of it

651
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,400
like a mess that's even worse than a mess I had it in which uh you know I've been to my

652
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:27,720
room again I visited my family for the holidays but you know yeah um which reminds me of like um

653
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:33,320
another move that happened previously like three years ago um when I when my family moved in 2013

654
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,920
I was all prepared to pack sentimentally but then I got fucking sick and I was sick for like a whole

655
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,640
day and I couldn't get out of bed and then when I was finally better we had like a few hours to pack

656
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,200
and I was like I had to pack all like frantically and I couldn't be dramatic at all I couldn't be

657
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,040
like nostalgic at all and I was so pissed off I'm like I was cheated I was cheated out of my sentimentality

658
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,440
you know I just realized if we develop space travel and people can like move to Mars and stuff

659
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,040
will they be sentimental for the earth like will I be sentimental for the earth like I bet um like

660
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,480
you know the the travel company that will like hey no for 20 000 bucks go to Mars you know and

661
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:17,400
live there start be on the colony I bet they'll be like hey for an extra 3 000 or it'll probably be

662
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,920
like 100 000 to get to Mars and it's like oh hey for an extra 20 000 trip around the world for like

663
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,880
five months so you can finally see the earth you can finally see all those wonderful locations

664
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,760
that you never got to see on your home planet you know like just give them one final goodbye you

665
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:39,000
know before before you before you go on the ship to go to Mars and stuff that'll probably happen

666
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:48,200
so yeah yeah I packed it up and then I uh gone like gone the plane you know what and then I ended

667
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,720
up in the Chicago O'Hare airports which is which was the step the stepping stone to get over to

668
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,400
Virginia so I was like okay so which terminal do we got to go down and I went the wrong direction I

669
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:05,400
got to the end of like the C terminal I think and I was like okay so here I am actually no it was

670
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,080
like the E terminal or something or the F terminal I think it was E terminal and uh I was like oh wait

671
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,800
I'm at the end of the terminal it's a dead end wait this isn't the right place oh it's in the B

672
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:22,680
terminal so I began walking and it was a long ass walk you know every airport I've been to I've

673
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,320
always been told this is a small airport and I'm like what are you talking about this place is huge

674
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:32,360
like oh man the Virginia airport kind of a small airport I'm like what the Virginia airport is like

675
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:39,240
five times the size of the Kansas City airport that I come from you know um the Chicago airport

676
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,440
was like a Lovecraftian experience of a walk like it was just like giant giant endless

677
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,520
hallways one after the other it was ridiculous and it wasn't great on my ankle either incidentally my

678
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,960
ankle is is definitely still still healing and especially after this whole week where I spent

679
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,000
walking around with my girlfriend constantly now I'm now I'm back to sitting down and not walking so

680
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,800
hopefully it'll be healed up by by summer hopefully geez anyway you know it was a lot of walking

681
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,880
right and it's cool I love walking except for the fact that I have my ankle problem but other than

682
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,920
that walking is cool it was a really cool scenic trip and I was like man this is a cool place and

683
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,480
then my flight got delayed a couple times and then canceled and it's like yeah um you're gonna

684
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:28,440
have to go your flight is gonna be like 15 hours from now and I was like oh so it's like go to the

685
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,320
customer support place and they're gonna give you some meal vouchers and a hotel voucher and I'm

686
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:39,080
like okay so I went back to like the sea terminal or something and the line was super long and some

687
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,800
customer support lady was like hey go actually no no it was the B terminal that I was at but then

688
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:49,720
the customer lady was like hey the um customer support lady was like hey go to the sea terminal

689
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,160
and I was like okay because she said there's another line there that's not as long

690
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,200
I hadn't been to the sea terminal like on my trip from the E terminal to the B terminal

691
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,120
I didn't go to the C terminal so that one was like this huge like there's this underground bridge

692
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,280
you have to get through that's like all colorful and like just just felt like some sort of purgatory

693
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,080
land with those automatic runways walkways and then you get into the C terminal and it's like a

694
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,600
totally different section I didn't even see for lack of a better term and so it's like man this

695
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,080
place is so freaking huge and uh so I got up to the customer support and they were like okay

696
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,600
here's your meal vouchers and uh I actually declined a hotel voucher I was trying to negotiate for

697
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,480
just more meal vouchers but I didn't get the negotiation but I just refused the hotel voucher

698
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:41,000
and here's why first of all I don't want to have to um deal with like transitioning like

699
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,880
it was a difficult transition mentally to be like okay I'm with I'm at the hotel now I'm in a car

700
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,280
now I'm in you know the airport now I'm going through security now I'm in the airport then I

701
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,480
get on an airplane then I'm on an airport again right so what I wanted to do was then get on an

702
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,520
airplane then go to the Virginia airport then be in Digi's car then go get sushi and then I'm home

703
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,960
right that's the number of transitions if I get if I take the hotel voucher it adds two more steps

704
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,840
the step of get out of the airport get on a bus like a shuttle that they were gonna offer

705
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,720
go into a hotel check into a hotel just to be there for like one night then check out

706
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:21,240
then go into a bus again get into the airport and then go through security again for a couple of

707
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,120
reasons one I haven't done it enough times to be natural at it like I like the first time I went

708
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,440
through it I was like okay electronics go here but not big electronics but like what but like what's

709
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,320
a big electronic where is the scale there where is the line drawn you know and okay like sometimes

710
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,440
they just look through all my stuff but sometimes they just scan it you know and also uh this time

711
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:47,800
on the trip back I have a um a vibrator thingamajig that Nikki wanted me to get so I was like I don't

712
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,720
know how many times I want to like take that out and put it in a little plastic tray for everyone

713
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:57,400
to inspect you know but oh well um but the but the other problem with going through security again

714
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,960
was that over the course of packing leaving the hotel and like going through security the first

715
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:09,960
time uh my zipper just died like this is like a this is like a 13 year old um suitcase so the

716
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,800
zipper just died from pressure and so then when I was wading around in the Chicago airport the

717
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,720
zipper like just came completely undone I had no way to secure it and so like the the airport

718
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:25,640
people gave me some like tape okay they gave me tape to just seal it shut with tape so it's like

719
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,840
you know obviously I just have to get more tape but that'd be a pain in the ass I wouldn't want

720
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,840
to inconvenience them like that to rip off the tape and then ask them for more tape because they

721
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,680
might not have it with them uh I wouldn't want to have to buy my own tape I wouldn't have to

722
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,720
blow money on that and so it's like if I go to the if I go to the hotel I'm not gonna be able to

723
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,400
open my suitcase anyway right like I might be able to tap hazardly retie the tape but that would

724
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,840
just be such a pain so it's like I'm not gonna be able to be comfortable anyway because I'm not

725
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,600
gonna be able to open my suitcase not until I get home and now I am home I I still haven't opened

726
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:01,320
the tape yet but uh yeah I'm recording this before I put my clothes on and stuff but anyway

727
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,600
so there's there was that right all those reasons why I didn't want to go to a hotel but the number

728
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,840
one reason why I didn't want to go to the hotel was because you know I was getting sick I'd gotten

729
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,760
sick on the way packing from the hotel like like when I was leaving Nikki and I was like I was

730
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,840
getting a sore throat I was getting stuffy so at this point I was like thoroughly sick and I was

731
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:25,080
like okay in combination with my deliriousness from like transitioning from a hotel to an

732
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:29,880
airport and stuff I'm tired right I'm tired from expending all this energy I'm mentally

733
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,840
like tumultuous I'm like turbulence in my mind and I'm sick and I'm tired probably so what I assumed

734
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:41,480
would happen is that I'd get to the hotel I'd fall asleep at some point it would probably take me

735
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,760
a few hours to get to sleep and then I'd sleep so hard that my alarm won't wake won't wake me up

736
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:52,440
and then I'll miss my flight right like knowing me there's a decent chance that that could happen

737
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,600
not like a high chance but like not a chance that I would want to risk right

738
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:03,160
and uh and so then what I thought was that well obviously what's most likely is that I'd be so

739
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:08,040
afraid of that happening that I wouldn't be able to sleep at all like I'd never be able to be calm

740
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,800
enough to go to sleep because I'd be so nervous that that would happen so then I wouldn't be able

741
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,640
to sleep anyway so then what would be the point of going to the hotel and dealing with all the

742
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,120
inconveniences of that you know like just just stay in the airport so I refused the hotel voucher

743
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,880
and I thought I'm just gonna stay in the airport I'm gonna do the whole sleep in an airport thing

744
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,280
right because I knew that if I'm sleeping in the airport I'm not going to be able to sleep

745
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:34,360
comfortably enough I'll still be on edge enough that like I'll wake up easily right and indeed I

746
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,200
was only able to sleep for like 20 minutes here and there and lay down for a couple hours here and

747
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:44,600
there so you know but yeah uh so and also the other reason was that I thought being in this

748
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,240
in this airport for like 13 hours 15 hours would be pretty cool you know I'd just be wandering

749
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:55,560
around doing whatever I want have 20 dollars of free food you know so so I did it and um

750
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:02,920
you know uh I like the movie Terminal starring Tom Hanks where a dude gets stuck in a hood in an

751
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:09,800
airport for like years like a year and a half I think so or nine months I think yeah so that was

752
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,360
that was a cool movie and I was like I want to do that you know being on an airport for like 15

753
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:19,160
hours so there's this sort of like romanticization I have of it in my mind of like you know living all

754
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,240
it's like living on your own it's like this weird vagabond in this place

755
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,160
and it really didn't like get me down at all because it's like I'm always just thinking you know

756
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:34,840
when I get home I'm just gonna like lay down in bed and play earthbound a bunch on my phone using

757
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,120
a moga 2 pro controller where you can play a controller on your phone with an emulator of

758
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,400
super nintendo with earthbound inside of it right so like I'm just gonna do that when I get home

759
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,280
so if I'm stuck in the airport for 15 hours I'll just play earthbound for 15 hours same

760
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:54,680
difference just with a bunch of noise and fluorescent lighting around me I ended up not

761
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,760
playing that much earthbound though I was mostly just on a call with with nicky because she was

762
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,080
all sad that I was gone and so she just needed to keep talking to me and you know I was getting

763
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:08,280
pretty lonely so I guess the point is I felt really productive still like the small amount of

764
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,840
earthbound I played I felt really accomplished in and like the other things I was doing I felt

765
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:19,400
really accomplished in um there's like this uh the sort of narrative that unfolded with a towel

766
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,920
at the airport when I was there at the whole time uh which was the hitchhiker's guide to the

767
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,160
galaxy reference um to explain the joke to people in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy they mentioned

768
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,800
that if you have a towel with you a towel with you while you're hitchhiking you're gonna look

769
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,760
much more competent as an individual you will look like a hoopy fruit and a hoopy fruit means

770
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,920
someone who is really amazingly together someone who's really competent and knows what they're

771
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:48,840
doing if you have a towel with you so I read hitchhiker's guide on the flight over to see nicky

772
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:53,480
and I was like huh a towel and they just so happened to buy a towel at walmart when I was

773
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,880
with her because I felt like having an extra towel for the hotel and then when I was packing up I'm

774
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,640
like you know what it's going to be an unnecessary waste of space but I'm going to take the towel

775
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:08,680
with me uh just for the sake of being hoopy so um yeah and I tweeted about it extensively so I

776
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,520
recommend going to my twitter and scrolling down to like um February the 21st and just reading I

777
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,400
highly recommend reading all of my tweets from that from that uh section from that timeline

778
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:26,280
uh from the 21st up through march 1st yeah being in an airport uh I felt really

779
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,000
competent I felt really put together you know the only thing that sucked about it was being sick

780
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,480
and not being able to walk too much without my ankle getting sore

781
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:42,600
and motorcycle came and went anyway um yeah uh I felt really I felt like I was really using my

782
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:48,280
time really well and it was just that looming overhead knowledge of a schedule of like a time

783
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,960
you have to do something right like you know I've I've I've I've I've flown a bunch of times now

784
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,440
in the last in the last five months you know flying over to Virginia then flying over to my

785
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,760
family and back and then flying over to Nikki and back so it's like I've I've done the airport

786
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,960
experience a bunch of times in a row now like three times in a row now and every time I feel

787
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,280
really like I'm I'm managing my time well because there's again this looming overhead

788
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,000
schedule that you have to conform to but it's a schedule that mostly involves sitting around

789
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,600
right and whenever you see business dudes who obviously fly all the time with their laptops

790
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,200
they seem really wired they seem really plugged in they seem like they really know what they're

791
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,280
doing they seem like every second is being maximized for efficiency and that's what I felt like

792
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:36,440
um in the Chicago airport that whole time like I felt like I was always doing something

793
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:42,040
whether playing earthbound or talking to Nikki or tweeting something funny so and I was like I

794
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:47,560
wonder if that's part of how of where Casey Neistat gets his power because Casey Neistat's a very

795
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,080
prolific person who makes you know who did like a whole vlog series where he made a fully edited

796
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:58,280
vlog every day for like a year and a half just to do just for the sake of itself um and he still

797
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,240
makes a pretty decent upload of videos and he does all sorts of other business things all the time

798
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:09,000
I mean and it's because well not because but in addition to that he flies places all the time

799
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,880
like businesses phone him up be like hey fly to this place they give him a first class ticket

800
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:20,440
and he's just flying all the time all over the place and I'm like uh man I wonder if that's part

801
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,960
of where his productivity comes from that he do you always have these these these upcoming dates

802
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,160
where you have to do something but most of those dates involve sitting around and you can open

803
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:37,320
your laptop and do something then you know and I and I was like yeah it's it's a very distinct

804
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,600
different feeling from what I do normally and what Digi does normally and what Ben and the other

805
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:49,080
pcp people mostly do is you're just in your room for weeks on end not even really needing to leave

806
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,480
having to completely motivate yourself to get stuff done and I love doing that I love motivating

807
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,880
myself and and making it all happen and like I feel like I'm pretty good at it and stuff

808
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,960
but I do think it was a very interesting different feeling to have this whole airport thing going on

809
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:12,200
so maybe if you know maybe if when I'm rich and I can just fly around all for the sake of it or

810
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:17,080
I don't know like I do all these business things involve flying around a bunch maybe I'll be even

811
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,440
more productive then maybe I'll really dig that lifestyle I don't know but you know I don't probably

812
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:29,800
not necessary I'm pretty good at this being at home thing probably as a result of being home

813
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:35,320
schooled you know like my parents policy was basically like hey you can do what you want right

814
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,680
with your life like if you're willing to work and it's something sensible and you're going to be

815
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:43,320
responsible you can take the life path that you want to take right so like my younger brother he got

816
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,920
into like uh into like hunting and guns and like knives and just being like an outdoorsman kind of

817
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:53,240
dude so that's kind of the life he leads and also working with my dad and playing video games and

818
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:58,040
stuff but yeah he's just sort of he's sort of like that uh and you know working out and being slim

819
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:03,160
he doesn't work out enough to like have like visible muscles but he's got like a nice fit body and

820
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:09,320
stuff plays sports I think that kind of guy my sister you know she got into dancing and like

821
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:14,120
performing the performing arts so that's kind of her life and she actually wanted to like go to a

822
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,160
school so eventually she convinced my parents to be like okay you can go to like this sort of

823
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:26,280
Christian school thing you know um so that's her lifestyle right me I was just like oh I guess I'll

824
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:31,800
just stay in my house all the time you know I'll just stay inside I go outside a lot but mostly

825
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:37,560
just my backyard that's kind of what I like I like being outside I like fresh air and sunlight

826
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,640
but I'm okay just being on my own property you know that's what I like about trampolines you

827
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:47,000
know that's actually should have probably been on the list is uh it's a great way to like just exert

828
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,200
physical energy without leaving the site of your house you know it's a whole lot of activity

829
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,560
without without even going away from your back door and you know pools are the same thing so

830
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:01,400
that's kind of what I'm into you know I like getting out and going places but I'm perfectly

831
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:08,840
content to just stay still all the time and when all of your school work is also homework I guess

832
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,120
I just am good at at doing that kind of work where you just have to motivate yourself you're in your

833
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:19,320
bedroom you could be playing DS right now but you're gonna do the work anyway you know uh so so

834
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:24,040
there you go that's that was like my lifestyle choice in combination with the lifestyle my parents

835
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:29,000
sort of gave to me uh you know the downsides are that you know I'm more awkward as a result because

836
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,400
I didn't want to go out and like talk to people all the time so like you know I come off as like

837
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:39,800
quiet or when I do talk I'm way too loud uh you know that's a downside but the upside is that I

838
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,360
feel like I'm really well specced to be a youtuber like all my stats are really uh leveled up in that

839
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:57,080
regard uh to be a youtube person who can also work at making programs and stuff yippee whoops

840
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,560
and uh that's it that's the end of this episode of the devu hadron collider episode four even though

841
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:12,680
to me it feels like episode seven because of all those other ones I recorded that uh I don't know

842
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:19,880
maybe I'll release them at some point maybe I could um release them as bonus episodes only for uh

843
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,680
hmm maybe for the pcp patreon I could do that yeah maybe I'll do that I don't know

844
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,960
tell me how badly you'd want to listen to them I guess you'd probably want to listen to them just

845
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,520
because you have no idea what they're about but you know most of them are redundant off of each

846
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,200
other because each one was meant to be a replacement of the other one I don't know okay whatever

847
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,400
that's the end um I'm gonna take a sip of this tea even though it's all gone for dramatic effect

848
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:00,280
sighing for dramatic effect
