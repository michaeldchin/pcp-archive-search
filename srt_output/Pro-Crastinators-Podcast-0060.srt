4
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,040
So rude. Don't forget our good friend that's the Clay Saban.

5
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Fuckbitch is podcast here is everybody.

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,920
Yay!

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,280
So today's topic is a technical one that some of us are more familiar with than others and

8
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,420
Cicely, but you know I should have beat around the bush for like an hour before I got

9
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,780
That's what it is. It sounded like munchie laughing

10
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,000
It did it did I like to booze like in the distant background laughing like he's off doing something else still listening

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,860
No, I pulled the fucking mic away for myself. Oh, it was a spike. Okay every time you've done that

12
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,220
I always assume it's it's quieter because you throw your head back and laugh as loud as you can

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,920
That's why it sounds like an owl DNA, man

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,380
I imagined he's like pacing in the back of his room whenever he's not talking trying to think of what to say

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,420
And then he bum rushes at the mic like oh, it's time to go. Exactly. Um, I

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Yes

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,940
Hi, I'm close at the microphone now. Is that good? Yeah, I'll just keep looking at

18
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,780
Let's stop fucking around here people. Oh, we have to be as unconcise as possible. This isn't even non concise

19
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:34,580
This is just off topic completely totally irrelevant. Well, that's that is relevant to this point because I think people when they think of concise

20
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,940
They don't exactly know what it means, right? Okay, so when we talk about concise writing

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,980
It's about how quickly you can sort of make a point and like just

22
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,140
Clearly communicate your intentions without beating around the bush and stuff and like there's a there's a huge difference between

23
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,900
Going off topic or even being long-winded like you can be long-winded and concise

24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,820
I think I haven't looked at the definition of concise recently. I don't know if it has to be short

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,380
But like for instance, I often get accused of

26
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,220
By that anime snob that that my hero

27
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,140
Yes, yes my hero, but that's an amazing app whose videos are all under 10 minutes long

28
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,820
And he gives me lots of shit for my videos being longer

29
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,420
And he often says that like, you know brevity is the soul of wit and stuff like wow

30
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,820
He's a smart dude. Yeah, his videos are just 20 second segments from other people's videos. Like what does he even do?

31
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,780
Well, that's the thing is that he he keeps his stuff so short that he never makes a point and it's not that he's

32
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,620
Necessarily concise. It's just that he's brief

33
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,260
And you know what? Yeah, that's interesting because I just went to urban dictionary comm our home base

34
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,340
To look up the definition of concise and it is relevant to this

35
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,140
So the other full definition of definition here is concise to be brief

36
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,800
But inclusive able to sum up a topic succinctly

37
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,980
succinctly without elaboration or superfluous detail

38
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,140
And so the point here is you have to be making a real point in order to concise and if that is lacking that you're just being brief

39
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,340
I guess it's it's how much useful interesting worthwhile shit is packed in per minute

40
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,780
Like whereas that anime snob will often try to he'll take a lot of different points and make individual videos about all of them

41
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,500
I'll just put them all in one. You know, it's not that my writing is not being more concise. Yeah, I'm not I'm not being

42
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,260
I'm not not being concise. I'm just making a lot of points in a row, you know

43
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,060
And that's what he doesn't seem to there can be a lot by the way

44
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,100
There could be lots of works out there that are really verbose and really long-winded

45
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,720
But don't come off like you're wasting your time as long as you're interested in all the material out there

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,340
You know, you know, maybe some is it? There may be some very popular

47
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,420
harem anime franchise out there that might have a lot of long-winded conversations or maybe some

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,340
I've been reading that might have a lot of long-winded conversations

49
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,180
But if all those conversations are really fucking interesting, then shut up is good as long

50
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,380
It's just that it's really hard for people to meaningfully fill large amounts of dialogue with actual interesting things to say and like anime often

51
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,340
I'll see like like any show in series

52
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,020
I was talking about this like a show in series will start off with a lot of interesting things to say because all the thought goes into the

53
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,180
premise of the show or the or the manga or whatever and then like they just get away from that like I don't know

54
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,140
I think that's part of what makes like Hunter Hunter special or even Yu-Haka show is that

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,140
Every battle is concise in those shows where like there's just a shit load of battles

56
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Like you watch you Yu-Haka show or Hunter Hunter would always struck me about those shows is no fight ever lasts more than one

57
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,020
episode, well, that's not true of early Yu-Haka show, but

58
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,740
Hunter Hunter and what's another show? I was thinking of the

59
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Dragon Ball Z

60
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,460
There's

61
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Certain shows where yeah, like a fight is always like at most an episode to an episode and a half

62
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,940
And it doesn't give you time to get tired of it

63
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,100
It just gets in shows off these cool powers right and like makes the point and goes you know and like so many people will give

64
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,980
Showing an anime shit just for being so long

65
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,820
But like how is it long is it long like DBZ where it really is just wasting a lot of fucking time, right?

66
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,340
Or is it long like you Yu-Haka show where it keeps making new points?

67
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,500
Well, dude, there's there's shows I'm gonna bring out as great examples of I think is as great concise writing and one is of

68
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Course Gern Lagen because so much happens every episode of Gern Lagen

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,020
It really moves the pace forward at a wonderful brisk pace does not waste your fucking time

70
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,780
And the other one is high school the dead and I really think high school the dead

71
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,580
You know, I made that me a mafia episode about it is really great

72
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,940
And I didn't talk about it as much but that show definitely makes a point in every episode every single episode like

73
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,940
There's probably like people would often think that because it's a zombie show

74
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,340
It's gonna like waste your time and be a bunch of faffing around like oh zombie fights all the time

75
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:57,060
But no like it's real human drama all these characters developing every single episode you can see them changing and evolving over time

76
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,060
And like the directing is great. It's super hype. There's intense moments all the time

77
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,660
It's got you know, the crazy fan service and action happening all the time

78
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,820
It really again, that's a show that does not waste a second of your time

79
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,580
You feel like you're learning something every time you're watching I I want to I want to say something about like Davoo was in playing that

80
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,900
No, I'm playing it saying users webcomic, right? It's it's Homestuck. He's been reading

81
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,420
Could you could could you say despite its length that Homestuck is concise?

82
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:32,180
I would not you could probably tell the whole the whole all the fucking conversations of Act 5 in a much more linear

83
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,220
Condensed fashion it just wouldn't be nearly as funny and you get to know all the characters

84
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,700
Yeah, I mean like because I'm what are the end of Act 5 now

85
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,820
And it's like it's like what actually happens in Act 5 gets summarized by the self-insert

86
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,140
Vector in like a couple of pages and it's like, okay

87
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,700
This is actually pretty straightforward plot. It's just told really fucking out of order, you know

88
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,420
Well, the thing that yeah, the thing that I'm thinking of is like it's it's not being brief

89
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,220
You know, it's different from just being brief. It's different from cutting things out

90
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,740
You know like you could you could argue that a lot of the things in Homestuck that seems stupid eventually become relevant

91
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,580
So like how much should like how much is I don't I don't get it

92
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,940
I'm very I mean you guys are talking about conciseness like, you know what it means. I don't really understand it

93
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,340
I don't think like I mean, it's essentially as I explained

94
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,380
It's just like not it's a consistent presentation of new ideas as opposed to reiterating the same idea

95
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,340
Give you ever what watch like Inuyasha or Rambo one-half. Nope any of that kind of shit. No, okay

96
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Well, you've seen Dragon Ball Z, right?

97
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
I read it. I don't know if he has

98
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,540
Reading it's actually way better than watching it

99
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,340
So, okay

100
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,780
Well, there's like in Dragon Ball Z for example the classic thing is that like a single fight that maybe took out like a couple chapters in the

101
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,460
Manga like gets dragged out for like for the classic things the Frieza battles at the end of like the first arc of DBZ

102
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,460
Like it takes like so many episodes for just and barely anything happens in those episodes

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,460
It is such a waste of your time to like actually sit through

104
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,020
Yeah, that's the thing like that's why I'm thinking like Homestuck so much of it is so great and interesting and it's not

105
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,180
It doesn't feel like a waste of time. It's not like that Homestuck is actually making like like it goes on for so long

106
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,860
And it goes through things like, you know, in case we weren't clear

107
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Davoo was arguing that Homestuck was concise. Yeah with good stuff

108
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,340
It's not concise with like a conventional normal like plot that you would understand as a normal thing

109
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,460
It's just concise with you know characters being manic idiots hours

110
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,820
I would argue that Homestuck does have moments where it does kind of just hammer on the same

111
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,700
Some of those conversations like the exact same conversation you read earlier, you know

112
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,860
Like there are moments where it's it does push it a little bit

113
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,620
But I do think the story has so much going on that like it deserves to be as long as it is

114
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,740
You know, it's appropriate to say that conciseness does not necessarily mean better in all cases, of course

115
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,060
Yeah, I would say that Homestuck really adds a lot of flavor by having like it is about a bunch of teenage drama

116
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,540
Stuff happening between kids it makes sense that wouldn't be concise these kids waste a lot of everyone's fucking time mostly their own

117
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,420
But yeah, and like I said, it's it's about what it deserves like yeah with Dragon Ball like

118
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Because the manga exists and everything like we know Dragon Ball Z didn't need to be as long as it is

119
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,020
We know you could have told they may have improved that without exactly like we know you can do it without taking up that much time

120
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,740
So to me, that's what concise is it's like tell the story or or write your thing

121
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,080
Whatever you're doing just do it in the smallest amount of time that you need and that's

122
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,280
People don't understand that you do need some

123
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,880
Humanity in there you need some extra and like I talked about this in my video about how I learned how to write gooder

124
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Where I in like 2010 I became obsessed with simplifying my writing and like I cut it down until it was like just the bare

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,600
Essential language needed to communicate the point, but it felt like a fucking robot, you know, yeah, so like I

126
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,920
So I started going back in and adding in phrases and like adding in stuff that just especially for my videos stuff

127
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,520
That just sounds right to somebody like it engages your brain in a different way

128
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,040
Yeah, you need to have some like you know we're nice and concise

129
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,280
You know those those videos Davoo keeps posting about like a robot obviously made this video

130
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,800
Yeah, those are concise and that's uh, they don't fuck around. They really tell you

131
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Across the United States or whatever hold the fuck on they're not that size the robots don't know shit about fuck

132
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,040
They'll just be like number 12 number 12 person who obstinately refused to tear down their house as Chinese

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,120
Highways are trying to be built this person really stood up for themselves and didn't stand down to the man number 11

134
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,840
This guy really goes to show how much society can't progress when some people are stubborn like shut up

135
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,440
Robotic you're fucking boy. So, you know like I did you saying I think there's like four like steps that people go through to like

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,080
Master and art step one is you just learn how to basically do anything you learn how to basically write put together a little bit of music

137
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,600
Put together a little bit of painting it starts out small and then as you get more ambitious and more skilled you make something big and

138
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
encumber some and

139
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,600
Bloated and then you start learning how to refine your skills and and you just get smaller and smaller until it's this perfect condensed ball

140
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,200
That doesn't have much breathing room and then you use your newfound perfection

141
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,520
Skill to just slowly weave stuff back out

142
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,360
It's like watching like an explosion in like an anime where like it goes

143
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,560
Then it sucks back in and then it slowly wooshes out again. That's what I come for is yeah

144
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,800
Yeah, like like the like the the whole earth. Yeah, the whole the trees go like

145
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:48,560
It's either real or hey, uh, somebody made me always our good friend

146
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,880
Ukrainian the artist boy made a drawing of like someone when you were posting those pictures of oh, I was gonna say by the way

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Did she's calling in live from Gaikon?

148
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
2017

149
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,720
Because it was called a Gaikon you don't need to change it to Gaikon Gaikon already sounds like

150
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,880
Gaikon 3 or Gaikon 4 that was the thing that somebody post this guy posted Gaikon 5 and then

151
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,960
Ukrainian drew a picture of me on of the fucking skateboard just being like

152
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,480
I only meant to stay a while as I was like wearing the bunny suit and flying through this guy

153
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,400
It's great. Thank you. You're a gift. You're a gift. Anyway, let's get back to so I don't know

154
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,640
Why don't we talk about like the way that we try to be concise writers? I want to say one thing

155
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,760
Like we're saying that conciseness can be bad

156
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,600
What is the the worst concise thing like the two concise the thing that is way too concise

157
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,080
What Ben would tell us a story and cuts out all the interesting parts of it and just tells you the facts

158
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,040
I went here. I fuck this dude. I went home done

159
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,960
Story was definitely too concise

160
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah, I mean it's just that

161
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,320
I was gonna say like going off of what Nate said if we're gonna talk about how we are concise

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,960
Or do you want to talk first about art or about analysis because I think if there's a fan at home of the PCP

163
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,880
They're probably high school or college age. They have to write a lot of essays and what's scary about being

164
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,120
Concise is in an essay as you usually have, you know, you have to do eight pages

165
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,020
So how can you be both concise and stretch that shit out to eight pages just worry about you guys have

166
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,980
To teach you to do is just to learn is just to get the basic discipline of typing shit out

167
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,340
It's only when you get into college that they start telling you to actually how to write good school

168
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:44,780
Well, that's school. Yeah, I would say your system of this world only once you have base level mediocre confidence by the time

169
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,620
You're 18 and maybe if you work really hard and put all of your future life savings and do this degree

170
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,620
Then you can be decent in your life. I'll tell you I'll tell you to do like well

171
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,620
You know, I because I learned how to be concise because of an English teacher

172
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,220
but I was taking a

173
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,900
Like that class was to learn how to be a better writer and most college classes won't teach you that

174
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:13,100
They want you to learn how to write a college paper, which means pumping in as much frivolous bullshit

175
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,180
It's humanly possible to reach 50,000 words like if you look at like cider

176
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
talking about his thesis like

177
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,660
Like you you inherently through working your way up through school. You will learn how to bullshit

178
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,900
You will learn how to stretch things out. I learned how to do that back in high school

179
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,780
And here's my advice if all they give you is a minimum word count

180
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,340
Don't try to be concise ever if they try if they give you a minimum word count

181
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,980
Write as many fucking like as many ways of saying the exact same shit as you can to reach that word Jesse

182
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,780
What the fuck are those clicking noises? I'm hearing in the background. What are you doing? What is that? It's Jesse here

183
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,820
Yeah, that's I see I am also in this episode everyone

184
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,220
Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything, but Nate revealed your mic, so we don't hear you chewing

185
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,900
It sounds like you're eating tic-tacs. It sounds like you're just down in tic-tacs. I'm fucking around with shit

186
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:12,700
Jesse's always done that. Welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast. He's always like flipping a screw around into other screws on his desk

187
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
We're just doing that. I don't know what the shit all the time. It's white noise

188
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,180
I'm fucking building infiltration tools. I'm fucking living Persona 5. That's what I do

189
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,540
I stay at my desk and I create tools to infiltrate people's palaces

190
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,780
Hey, I think you're the only person. I know who's played Persona 5. Is it good? How you how's it going?

191
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,260
It is good. It's pretty okay. That's a topic now. That's a

192
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,380
It could be

193
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
It could be except that you're the only

194
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,180
My favorite Persona is when in Apescape 3 you can turn into a knight. That's my favorite one

195
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,740
Yeah, so talking about before we

196
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,380
Saying if they give you a minimum word count, you should be as civil as is possible

197
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,180
Yeah, if they give you a minimum word count and no maximum go apeshit if they give you a maximum word count

198
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,580
That's where you guys start worrying about it because that's why I learned to be concise as I had gotten so used to trying to pump as many words

199
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,980
Into a paper as possible and just like writing, you know

200
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,780
My life have I ever had a maximum word count? I think that could be why I'm such a fucking ridiculously

201
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,480
Yeah, this never cut my words down. This teacher. I had he told us to write a story about a

202
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,900
What was it? It was like write a story about a some a teacher who you learned something from or something some shit

203
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,380
Oh, he's just trying to beat himself off everybody right about me. This was like brand

204
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,820
We just this first paper way to write for the class and it was something like that. I know that's what I wrote about

205
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,420
I don't know if that's what the topic was but he said like

206
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,820
700 to a thousand words and I wrote like 1300 and I turned and I'm thinking like ha I am I surpassed your word count

207
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,540
But he like yeah, I'm even better. I know a thousand words. That's nothing to me

208
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
And he's like no I wanted this to be

209
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,620
700 to a thousand like you went over you need to go through this and like simplify it and so I took out a bunch of words

210
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,540
I got it down to like just over a thousand and he reads it

211
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,780
He's like there's still a lot of stuff in here like like he points out some stuff

212
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,500
That's like unnecessary and I was like yeah now that I think about that is unnecessary and I work it down to like

213
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,060
700 words and it was like a tight little piece. It was much better like I'm reading over it

214
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,860
And I'm like wow my original fucking blue because I didn't do I didn't try to control myself ever ever ever go to school

215
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,940
So yeah, like the whole conciseness thing there's not like any like it's not like some sort of magic different way that things can

216
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,900
Be good or bad. It's just a different lens of how to approach

217
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,100
Removing things that are not good and adding only things that are good, you know

218
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,340
I think that that's I feel like that's part of what makes

219
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,180
Cartoons Western cartoons better now than they were like in the previous era

220
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,700
Where a lot of cartoons would just have a lot of episodes that don't matter much, but then you see the universe

221
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,180
But then you see oh no, no, I'm talking about you doing it backwards

222
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,540
All right, listen for a couple of minutes you have to all agree with me for the point to be made so

223
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,460
Like adventure time it feels like they're really trying to make only awesome stuff happen

224
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,380
Whereas I honestly feel like when I look at a lot of older shows they're like well

225
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,840
I guess this episode something just kind of okay will happen. They're just really

226
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Man masters of the universe kind of just yeah, just just make only the cool stuff happen

227
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,540
Just try to cheat, you know, just just make a dessert. That's nothing but chocolate and vanilla

228
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,820
You know, not every guy tune has like a continuous storyline and character progression and shit

229
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,540
Like sometimes you just want to see SpongeBob hang out at the Krabby pad. Yeah, but do the best ones of that hang out at the Krabby pad

230
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Yeah

231
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:57,180
Yeah, no, I totally agree with DeVue on that point because that's what I've always struggled with but like a lot of longer shows is like

232
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,540
For instance, Ranma one half as you brought up earlier as a show. That's not at all concise

233
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,300
There's just so much fucking wasted time in that show. It's a hundred and sixty episodes

234
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,340
And like the first like 20 tell this really like compelling

235
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,220
Romance story and then the last like like like throughout the show. There's about 60 episodes that are like great

236
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,940
Out of a hundred and sixty, which is pretty good

237
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,420
There's about 96 that like you like should watch and there's about 60 that you just shouldn't you know and like you have a

238
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Actual posts

239
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,420
Yeah, I'm watching guide for Ranma like it's like, you know, here's like the minimum you should watch

240
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,660
Here's like each different tier of episodes essentially and the ones that you shouldn't watch

241
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,660
It's because they just boil it down to like the basically flander eyes the characters a perfect example

242
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,900
Is the second Ramo and half movie which is fucking dog shit and it like all the movie consists of is the most

243
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,900
Basic idea of what each character is like just using the most obnoxious running gags

244
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,860
Like the movie effect because movies are always afraid to like challenge the status quo

245
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,300
So there will be no development in a lot of movies like that and and just not even doing anything with the characters

246
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,540
Cuz like the best episodes of the show are where you see them change a little bit or you see some kind of small

247
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,700
Insight into who they are whereas the worst episodes are when they're just being like again

248
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,940
Flander eyes like just like what what is this character known for oh?

249
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,660
She she always she always trips and falls in the main character and calls him a baka Inu

250
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,460
You know like that's that's something that has to happen every episode so then you get a movie and it's just that yeah

251
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,140
It's just and it did it with like every character in the show, which there's a huge cast kind of a complete waste of time

252
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,940
I mean help fucking SpongeBob does the same thing the first three seasons have like say let's say 20 ideas

253
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,940
And then it's been like 50 seasons now and they're still just cycling through the same ideas for some reason

254
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,580
I just realized okay, but Spongebob's a little intro to this episode should be the the preparing the Krabby Patty dramatic intro thing

255
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,420
Cuz that's very unconcise. It's like just making you sit around but that's the point

256
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,380
That's like anti-humor. I know it's great. That should be the intro just saying guys, okay, okay

257
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,260
Tell that to whoever edits this see whoever at Ben I guess oh

258
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,660
Okay, there you go you and Ben are really fighting over this editing spot. This is good challenge Ben make Ben into a real boy

259
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Please make him work for something in his life

260
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah, okay, cool, but I do like it though

261
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Well, I think there's a place for shows like Spongebob that I mean they don't challenge their status quo at all like but they're completely focused on

262
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:40,100
Being you know sort of consumable pop entertainment that just brings you I don't know like there's you're not learning anything watching a

263
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,820
11 minutes of the episode rather than like a season-long story arc. Yeah, so it's not really comparable to like

264
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,900
I do think it's comparable and I mean like do you think it is?

265
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,380
I mean Ramo and half is the same story like it doesn't it doesn't really have an ongoing plot

266
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,660
It's that Ramo mixes in like that that character development stuff because there is like a thing

267
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,820
We're we're waiting for like relationship

268
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,860
16 episodes of Ramo is all the development in the show like after episode 16

269
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:15,300
It just cuts off and like because the development that happens supposedly it's just the same thing over and over again

270
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,940
It's just the characters

271
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,540
Realizing that oh, maybe we do love each other, but then it goes back to status. I mean I'm not as familiar with with Ramo

272
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,260
But here's a better example

273
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:29,620
Future Rama like there's certain episodes. We all remember a future Rama either because they're the really dramatic ones

274
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,500
Or they're the ones that are so hilarious and like over the top with their concept and really did something unique and interesting

275
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,980
but there's other episodes of future Rama that are just like

276
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,420
Just whatever dick around like do the same thing we've done in a million other episodes and like no one remembers those ones

277
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,300
I think you know those some people are annoyed by those

278
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,820
I love almost everything about future Rama and I think it's because again

279
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,780
It has a more comedic tone and it can get away like you're never gonna be super disappointed when there's just a future Rama episode

280
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,700
That's just if it's just hilarious

281
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,500
I mean even the baseline of the show is pretty good and like a show that I think is

282
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,800
Very close to all killer no filler is Rick and Morty right where like, you know, we've got two two seasons and

283
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,360
There's like maybe three episodes that I would be like, I don't know if I want to watch that one if I was Marathon

284
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
I don't even know if I go that high. I don't think there are any I'd love them all

285
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,740
I mean, I will rewatch all of them right right for sure

286
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,720
But like there's a couple that aren't as good as the other like raising gazorp is or not as many people are gonna watch that

287
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,320
Yeah, again, you know

288
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,720
But like so much of it is so strong because they really do approach every episode with like let's come up with another

289
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,480
Crazy-ass idea like let's always have it so it's something you never thought of that's always gonna be like a little bit of a mind

290
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,280
Blow even when it like repeats like, you know, the the whole marriage between

291
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,540
Jerry and

292
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
What's the name?

293
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,440
Yes, like Jerry and Beth's marriage has been it's it's kind of beating a dead horse at this point

294
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,400
That's true, but they still find new things to do with it, you know, so like even though it's kind of status Khloe

295
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,360
It's still like by the end of the episode you'll be like, okay, I guess you earned that one

296
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,520
How specifically are you relating this to being concise?

297
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,920
Well, just that I think that

298
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,280
Consciousness is about presenting new ideas like like like each I think it to repeat the same thing

299
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,440
You already said is to not be concise and like you can draw a parallel between this in like an analytical video where it's more

300
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Immediate and in a long-form TV show

301
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,560
Does a long-ass intro to the video is like this show came out in 1994 and it's pretty good

302
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,260
Even that stuff's not so much a problem. It's when they say like

303
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240
When I first watched this yeah, I didn't think it was good to be good

304
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,280
But then after watching it it turns out it was literally filler

305
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,720
You can literally just like the show the show is good. Yeah, and I did this in um, I

306
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,960
Showed there's a video of how I edited the writing for my Kemono friends video because the original opening sentence was like

307
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,000
Like if you just want to know whether or not I think this show is good

308
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,520
The answer to that is that yes, it is good, right?

309
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,440
And so I cut all that out and wrote Kemono friends is good

310
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,160
That's the edited version and it literally conveys the exact same meaning. Yeah, like it doesn't add or subtract anything

311
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,240
It's just the same sentence, but with way fewer words

312
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,200
I remember digi there was a time when you used to edit out

313
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Literally every single gap between any words you said, you know any any any breasts that you you would cut them out

314
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,640
And you would delete them back in and yeah, because it became so dense with information that people

315
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,600
I mean, I'm not sure people had problems with it, but I did it was a bit. I still do that

316
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,720
Um, I just did it recently because I just uploaded a a big long ranting rambly podcast about Pirates of the Caribbean 5

317
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,120
Yeah, and um, you know when you're recording it

318
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,140
It's all coming off the top of your head and you're going on and on right, but I

319
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Definitely I went through meticulously and shortened the breaths and put the sentences to each other like almost

320
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,080
Imperceptibly like just like you know like half a second closer to each other

321
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,720
But when it's an entire podcast and you're doing that between every sentence

322
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,080
You might shave off a good like half an hour of redundancy of just listening to me like breathing between sentences

323
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,640
And to be clear I mean I still cut out all breaths and all everything

324
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,000
It's just that what hippos referring to is if you watch my old pony videos the words literally run into each other

325
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,920
Like a sentence. There is no space

326
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,640
It will be like like one word finishes and like I would edit it that way

327
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,920
I would edit it so the words literally ran into each other and it's actually headache inducing to listen to like like when the videos

328
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,240
were like 15 minutes long and it was all like that and I'd be going between different points with no transition or anything

329
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,180
And so it was like it was hard to process even for me like I'd listen to it back and be like getting a headache

330
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,000
So I actually had an effect sometimes where I would feel suffocated

331
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,000
Because I don't hear any space to breathe and it's like it tricks my mind and like yeah

332
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,400
Like it fucked with me

333
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,600
I would actually feel like like loss of breath listening to some of this episode's back

334
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,920
I can't get another review show that does that's always done that to spectacular effect named that zero punctuation named after the gimmick

335
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Yeah, and you know he just writes it around that gimmick

336
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,160
It's like almost ever the whole almost every video is like ten seconds of a point ten seconds of a joke

337
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,960
And it it's like peanut butter and jelly is from one to the other constantly

338
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,320
So you're you can generally I think the fact that those are only five minutes long helps

339
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,240
Yeah, you can generally get all the point if you just just just empathize with your audience all the time

340
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,060
That's sort of a higher level skill in any art medium thing is being able to constantly

341
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,900
Simulate what it's gonna feel like to the person who this is for watching

342
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,740
You know who didn't do that in a in a big way

343
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,420
I didn't when I was making my Lucifer video that video was not it was

344
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,940
Concise there you go. Yeah for sure dense with too much information that I when I was editing it in slow motion

345
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,020
I thought okay everyone's gonna be able to get this gonna be able to read it. No problem and

346
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,380
Yeah, that's that's the problem

347
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,020
I've always had with with edit like editors that you know the extra credits guys still do this

348
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:13,540
Occasionally which really annoys me because I used to do it and I realized it was terrible is to have like a pun image on the screen

349
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,980
Yeah, which relates to like a single word in a sentence and then you know the viewer is then looking at this image thinking wait

350
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,780
What's that got to do with it? Oh, I see and then they've missed like the rest of the sentence in the style the next one

351
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,580
I've done some of that and and not liked it in the long run as well

352
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,500
Extra craze is fucking dog shit. I hate them on every level imaginable

353
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,140
Anyway, when it when it comes to to making my own things concise

354
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,020
I find it very difficult to imagine

355
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
Like when when the writing is bad

356
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,660
Until I've recorded it and I'm listening to it and I'm like, okay that sentence is stupid

357
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,100
I can cut that out because it doesn't sound right. It sounds like what I just said, so I can't read it very well

358
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm not like a word guy, but when I'm listening to it

359
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:03,060
That's when I usually cut down all the all the the the extra crap. I'm the same way give I do it the same way

360
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,900
I think perhaps the most important part of the writing process is to have somebody else read your work and tell you

361
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,940
Uh, yeah, you made this point like three paragraphs ago. Do you do you do that? I think you've talked about doing that

362
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,700
Mom definitely all of my videos I do for my main channel

363
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,820
I have one of my friends like Asperger or somebody read through it and that kind of thing

364
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:28,100
It's really have friends who are actually good who could actually I feel like 90% of people listening are gonna have friends who

365
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,220
Have no talent in this kind of thing at all and will never be good at all and so well

366
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,580
I think anybody can read something. Yeah, it's it's I don't think it's necessarily you have to be

367
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,060
You know a linguist or whatever to know that something is not concise if you just read it

368
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,180
And you're like I don't get this part that's it's weird and stupid

369
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,460
You know that's just what the viewer will think when they're listening to it

370
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,020
And did you bro has told me that in private?

371
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,060
He told me he loves it when fans send him work that they wrote and he loves to edit it for them and send it back

372
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,780
Oh, right

373
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,340
That you know, that's interesting because I I think I have a different mentality about it

374
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,420
And it's I'm probably not any better, but I have this weird

375
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,420
Fetishistic desire to be independent in everything I do or like have control over everything so I never ask anyone for help

376
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Well, you can always tell them

377
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,940
With what they said like oh, yeah, I see your point

378
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,500
It's like an attitude where I don't want to ever have to rely on anyone's feedback ever

379
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,900
I want all the skills to be contained within me, but whatever. I mean, that's just small thing

380
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,660
I got it

381
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,740
I mean you can learn the skills by having some sorry give

382
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,620
Like if you know if you have a friend who can teach you those things and then you eventually learn it from them

383
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,420
Then you will have the skill for yourself

384
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,180
Well, like I mean, okay, that makes sense

385
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,140
But to me the way to do that is to make the video all the way and like if there's problems with it

386
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,540
Okay, I'll fix it the next round. Well, yeah, I would do that, too

387
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,740
I wouldn't I wouldn't give them like one paragraph and be like is this okay

388
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,580
I'd I'd give them the whole thing and be like what am I gonna do like I mean

389
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,540
I what am I gonna do like send you my scripts and be like digi is this concise tell me what do you think I don't want to do

390
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,220
What's wrong with that? Why are you proposing it like it's crazy? Well, that's a great thing to do

391
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:12,300
I guess cuz that cuz then it's not just mine anymore than someone else has done right like I know I've checked scripts for some of you

392
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,980
Not me nigga before but I don't know who I think I made hippo check one of mine one time

393
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,340
I know I've checked hippo stuff on his blog before incidentally any you guys could send me one

394
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
I'd be happy to do it if you ever want

395
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
The thing about that

396
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,420
I was gonna talk about is I don't like

397
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,700
Like the idea of giving anyone an entire script because then all my jokes are spoiled and especially any of you guys

398
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,820
I don't want you guys to to see my script and see what I'm going for and then you know not be surprised and laugh at a joke

399
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:50,740
I mean you don't laugh, but it's just I like keeping cool things to surprise and I don't really usually like asking for help for that reason

400
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,660
But it's spoiling it for one person to make it better for thousands, so he's got to get around that mental block

401
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,300
But then again, I really care much more about what you guys think of my content than any of my audience for sure

402
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,900
Of course. No, you're all

403
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,840
Okay, I don't I don't know that I would

404
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,980
Trust any of you guys or anyone at all sure like proofread

405
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,380
Like a YouTube video that I'm writing like if I'm writing a book or a novel then yeah

406
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,260
I'm gonna look for an editor or someone who knows about books and novels

407
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,780
But if I'm writing an endless Jess YouTube video nobody gets to fucking touch it, but me

408
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,300
I don't think anybody needs to touch yours because yours are perfect. Well, you know to be fair

409
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:43,820
You know Jesse is not as my only one like him to be and there are I'm sure there are some changes that Jesse could make or any of

410
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,260
Us could make. Oh, no, um, the thing is what Nate was saying is that we want it to be our own thing

411
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,500
So if we make a mistake, we want to we want to personally learn from that

412
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,380
And I guess asking for help if you have like a very specific

413
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,540
Like question like like sometimes I come into the chat saying I can't think of a word that means this because I just need a word

414
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,460
I need a word that describes something. Well, and yeah

415
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,740
Direct advice from people is not the right idea 95% of the time unless you are like just just

416
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,460
Starting out because really the best thing to do is just make it and then sense

417
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:25,460
Clues and tells and signs and subtleties from the reaction that people get like digi all the time

418
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,380
Well explain how he tools his videos to cater to the way that people are reacting

419
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:36,980
But scarcely does that come in the form of just doing what people say they want it comes in the form of analyzing their reaction

420
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
And coming to new conclusions that they didn't even realize

421
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:46,180
That that comes down to a lot of the the classic. What was it prego sauce? Oh, yeah

422
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,340
It's a principal in economics about pasta sauce about how

423
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:59,020
Like basically they were trying to find new ways to make pasta sauce and they like asked people what what should we do?

424
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,580
And people gave suggestions and those didn't sell it all instead

425
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,580
They just made stuff up and gave it to an audience and the audience ended up liking it

426
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,180
And it just goes to show how the audience does not know what they of course, of course

427
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,860
Like they know whether they like it or not, but they don't know what they want it to be

428
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:21,740
You're slightly confusing. I am jimquisition videos. He has one about pasta sauce about I don't know if I've seen either

429
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,660
Then he has the other one about he has the other one about coffee

430
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:31,020
Where in focus group testing if you do a forum if you give people you ask people directly what kind of coffee they want

431
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,980
They over well money say they want a rich dark roast because that makes you sound cool

432
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,260
But then if you actually observe buying habits people usually like a shitload of ice and milk and cream

433
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,180
Yeah, they like weak-ass water down shit

434
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,700
So like when I I mean I will all the time ask people like hey

435
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,980
What should I make a video about or something like that?

436
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,900
But I never do anything that suggested to me like I'll ask I'll ask like all the time

437
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,180
Like I'll go on Twitter and do like polls or like ask people and then not do any of it and and instead

438
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:09,160
What I'm really trying to get is more of like just a sense of what people think I do right, you know like almost like

439
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,900
Yeah

440
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,660
Understanding the nuances of what makes art good is sort of what we all specialize in and monkey parodies us for thinking

441
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
We're so good at specializing in because

442
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah, like you know, I've experienced this make a fucking video like hey guys. Here's this game

443
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,300
It's called Undertale and here's five reasons why it's good and then everyone's like that's not why it's good

444
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,860
It's good because good characters and the good music

445
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,060
It's got good music. I mean that's why I know that people don't know shit

446
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,420
What my audience thinks they want from me is like go take

447
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,060
Like just make another video about the next episode of Evangelion, you know like oh there's got it

448
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,460
You talked about the first nine

449
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,020
There's got to be just as much to say about episode 10 or like take FLCL and break it down

450
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,900
We know there's a lot to say about FLCL because of course there is you know, but like well

451
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,340
Is that what is that actually going to be what they want when I make it? You know, is it or am I going to go?

452
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,900
definitely like

453
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,260
judging by

454
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,740
Like a YouTube comments. It's clear that

455
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,420
Nobody knows how to scrutinize my work correctly

456
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,900
They all do it wrong. So I definitely and I think that is not just applying to me

457
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,660
I think that probably applies to most people

458
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,100
I think that you should definitely cultivate the ability to scrutinize your own work

459
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,520
Before you like you shouldn't have you shouldn't depend

460
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,060
That is true

461
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,940
That is true, but you are in the entertainment business

462
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,780
So if people are not appreciating on a high on a large enough scale at some point the responsibility does fall to you

463
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,540
Right, but what he's saying is that you don't listen to what they say is wrong with it

464
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:55,460
Oh, of course, right. They don't know anything about like I mean like I feel like when I'm going over my own writing and I'm you know

465
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,500
Editing it and taking out redundancies to make it into a video mode

466
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,620
I mean, I might make mistakes and as few redundancies might get by me even

467
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:14,100
But I would almost rather have my mistakes left in it than have someone else fix it and have their stamp on it

468
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,180
Yeah, you know like whenever I've made like a mistake

469
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,140
I would rather if I if I make like an mistake early on and like I say a word wrong

470
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,700
I'd rather use that as an opportunity to do a silly editing thing to show how fallible I am like something

471
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Anything to make it like more like, you know, I would just work with what I have even if I made it

472
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,740
Yeah, in the event that someone gives you constructive criticism and it actually

473
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:46,180
Works it actually makes sense on its face then follow it in the event that happens

474
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,500
You know whole time. I was making videos Digi was the only one who ever gave me like constructive criticism that like made sense

475
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,900
And was correct and even then I always told him that he's wrong just for artistic integrity reasons

476
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,700
And then just silently fix the problems later. Oh

477
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,260
You've all done that to me. So it's fine. Don't worry

478
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,140
And I don't worry. This is how it's supposed to be. It's never said like oh, I changed my titles and thumbnails

479
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,460
explicitly because you told me to 500 times

480
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,140
One time

481
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,620
But I well, it's yeah, but I mean it's not like we talked about it behind your back

482
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,900
Give me a second here. It's not like DaVinci tells me Nate. Do something

483
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
I am the DaVinci of YouTube

484
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,140
Everybody at home

485
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,860
Hypothetically if you happen to not be a youtuber and maybe you're like a kid writing an essay

486
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,620
Don't be afraid to show it to people and get advice. We're not yeah, not all YouTube writers like we

487
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,460
Yeah, and I want to bring up like it's well. It's funny that no

488
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,700
We're not moving away until I clarify that it's not that Digi tells me something and I do it

489
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,000
It's that I have I saw the signs were all pointing that was me that was all me

490
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,420
I was explicitly saying to everyone guys, but I've done the research. I know the results

491
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,340
I don't do this. It's not like I'm there looking at your full month study. It's just a guy tell me what all right

492
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:22,160
Well, okay. I anyway made a realization. Okay, it's funny to me because Nate and Jesse and hippo are all very much like

493
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,740
Suggesting like I want it to be my product and like my it's it's all me and I don't want somebody else to like affect it

494
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
Yeah, I feel the total opposite. I will

495
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,340
Freely allow anybody's mark to be made on my video

496
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:42,260
I mean I blatantly copy other people's styles and tell like say so I do videos that other people suggested just recently I did

497
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,060
Why I dropped every anime I dropped because some guy on Twitter said it would be a good idea and I was like, hey

498
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:54,380
Yeah, let's do that and but the biggest way because I have to do edit my videos and I give him literally full rate like free range

499
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,900
You can do whatever the fuck he wants. I don't yeah, but I think the thing about that is that, you know

500
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,340
I will for me anyway is that a lot of the the comedy has to be like coming from me

501
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,980
Like if I think it's funny

502
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,180
It'll be like a thing like either I edit or I say it that way or like, you know

503
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,680
It's a different type of video too, you know

504
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,900
It's it's a different it's a different process because sure but like I mean I like

505
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,580
A lot of what happens in my videos now is just not my ideas or comedy

506
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,820
It's just devues and I like it more than what I would have come up with like yeah

507
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,220
But there's also the case that if I had if I say if I had an editor

508
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,860
He might do stuff that is worse than what I would have come up with and I would have to teach him at that point

509
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,460
Because like I know I'm very funny when it comes to things

510
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,420
Did you did you put in the time and you know, you know, the diva has been fully vetted at this point

511
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,620
So yeah, I mean if I had if I had a diva maybe but I don't have a diva. There's only one

512
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,460
I could be your diva tonight mom and dad will never know

513
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,620
I mean, I just yeah, like I constantly get offers of people

514
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,940
Why too sorry, did you know I constantly get offers of people

515
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,540
Like hippo said of like offering to edit my videos for me

516
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,700
You're like, you know, just decrease some of my workload and get more of my stuff out there, right, but like

517
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:20,620
If I have to train someone to edit the way that I would edit then that's like would take up just as much time

518
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,980
And be just as redundant as me editing it myself

519
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,660
It's a business cost, you know, like I when I was working on the galco video with this this new guy snooping turtle who is great

520
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,620
He's wonderful. Like I put out a Twitter like hey, I'm looking for a new editor

521
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,940
He was one of the guys who responded I checked out everybody's work his I like the best

522
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:41,140
So we ended up working together and you know, like we it took time like we went through and we went through the whole rigamarole

523
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,860
Of like going through like every bit submitting to me for approval. Okay, we'd work on in the next part submit that okay

524
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,180
These sorts of changes need to be worked in I need to do some editing and then stick it in and send it back

525
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,460
And but like I was willing to do all that not because it was super efficient at the time

526
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,940
But because I see a future relationship where we're doing more work together faster more efficiently better

527
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,380
And he's certainly he was interested in that and hopefully he still is hopefully hasn't changed his mind

528
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,260
So yeah, it's it's like an investment a sort of long-term investment

529
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,180
I'm much more interested in personally is

530
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,500
Trying to to make it so that I can get away with the least editing possible if you watch my my demon souls review that I made

531
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:25,700
It's basically it's there's nothing I put a few gifts on I put some video game footage that I recorded in a live stream

532
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,180
I liked your skeleton boys. They were yeah

533
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,860
And that was it. I just put relevant clips in and it was great and people's really like that because it you know

534
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,860
I didn't need to do

535
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,380
What just that that that one very simple

536
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:49,060
Editing choice right at the beginning of just having the skeleton gifts with the trombones along with the music

537
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,060
Those are trumpets you buffoon

538
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Trumpets whatever

539
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,580
It's trombones because they're skeletons you assie. Oh

540
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,340
Jess to go back to the last point you made

541
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,660
You don't want somebody else to edit your stuff

542
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,660
I know I know there was some talk in this chat about having one of us help out edit the plebe in the weeb

543
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,900
Like what did you decide on that? Do you still think like you are the only one who can do that? Yeah, that's um

544
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:22,580
Well now it's well like in my mind the plebe in the weeb at this point has morphed into like another

545
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:28,300
Aspect of the endless Jess grand narrative. So now no one can fucking touch it. Oh now it's trapped in my brain

546
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:35,900
It is there is one episode that we had talked about having Nate edit for reasons that will become apparent when the episode

547
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,300
but like releases

548
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,620
the um

549
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:45,120
Yeah, like everyone I started to hear the rumblings like five months in like where the fuck are these episodes?

550
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Yeah, and um

551
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,940
So the only reason you didn't hear the rumblings earlier is because people keep asking me instead of you

552
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,380
I guess but then they found out I didn't communicate well enough that Jesse was editing it

553
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,340
So everyone would just ask me where is the plebe in the weeb all the time

554
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,980
And I really love the clear I don't say as Jesse the artistic vision conveyed in the editing

555
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,700
It's so like it's all from Jesse's perspective and he just doesn't give a fuck. That's what's great. It's really great

556
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,820
It's really yeah, like that's the that's the reason because it's like how can I explain that idea to like an editor and have it

557
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,580
Make any sense like it can only be like how do I like how do I sit down the guy and be like, okay?

558
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,580
This this is not or this is not an anime talk show

559
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:30,620
This is a show about me ruining an anime talk show because I don't want to be there and it's all from my perspective and

560
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,900
When they talk about time slowing down

561
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,380
You're gonna slow time down and go into my brain and look at the French Revolution

562
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Set to the music from cross and which was an anime that came out two years ago that nobody in the world watched

563
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,980
And also every time that Jeff coughs, I want you to zoom in on him coughing for no reason at all

564
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:54,220
To be an extended ten minute section at the end where everything that did you saying about directing an anime is

565
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:02,780
Reflected in like weird like filters on the screen and his head gets fucking stupid and weird when he says the word off-model and shit

566
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:09,620
Like I can't possibly it's someone down and explain it would be it would take longer than editing it myself

567
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,620
But that's a very visionary video, and I'm sure you could have likes like smaller shit that you could pass along

568
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:23,100
You know like it's funny for me because of my most like my big videos like the main channel

569
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,460
Highly edited stuff is the one I want out of my hands and in devues

570
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,860
Whereas the stuff that like I couldn't possibly give to him that like I have to put my creative stamp on would be like

571
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:40,060
Insomnia analysis because it's so fucking weird like my even I don't fully understand my intentions with it

572
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:46,540
But it has to be me because how could anyone possibly know like I mean I'd just be giving you like a bunch of

573
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,260
Completely meaningless footage and being like do something with this

574
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:56,100
It's like how do you know which rap song matches best with the emotion that's on my face in this granted this clip

575
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,300
Yeah, I mean that's entirely true

576
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,260
There's definitely projects that are for you and you alone to do but like I mean the reality still exists

577
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:08,100
Of course that there are plenty of projects that you can have other people do right like galco and one punch man

578
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,820
Like you didn't edit those those I just wrote the scripts

579
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,180
And I thought you know what these are cool and all but I don't really give that much of a shit about the things that I brought

580
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,300
Even though I you know those are all at the time. I thought hey

581
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,260
These are really cool thoughts. I want to tell a story about or whatever and but yeah

582
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,660
I was happy to pass them off to give somebody else to edit and came out good

583
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,700
Wow, this should have a lot to do with the topic conciseness. Yeah, well, I mean a conciseness

584
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:36,020
But the workflow that the thing about writing concisely is that it's not a topic you could talk about for an hour

585
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:43,900
I want to ask everybody like do you guys have any specific things that videos do that waste time that isn't hey guys?

586
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,060
Sorry, I haven't made a video in a while and also when I thought the show was gonna come out

587
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:53,220
I thought it was gonna be this but it turned out to be that any other specific things that you feel waste your time

588
00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:00,220
I mean, it's just constant what I see in like especially analysis videos is constant redundancy and just

589
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,620
Saying the same thing three different ways and not seeming to realize that you're doing yeah, you know like hey guys

590
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:11,460
It's RC anime and like it's RC anime. Hi guys and guys. Hey, it's RC anime. Just stop it

591
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,620
We got the first you know like I remember going into making videos because I've always felt that making a point

592
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,700
Concisely is a thing like even back when I made videos in like 2008

593
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:27,860
I'm like I hated when people were like hi everybody. Hey guys. I never I've never started a video with hey guys

594
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,180
Sometimes I started a video with hello as dramatically as possible when I feel it's necessary

595
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,540
So I've always had a I've always been a stickler for not wasting time

596
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:43,740
I feel the same way about that specific thing. I always was like if you have to say hello get out, you know

597
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,840
But you know over time people have said well, I mean, you know, it's fine. It's good and it's good and it's fine

598
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,220
I'm like, I guess I guess it is good and it's fine and and sometimes I do it

599
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,220
I just you know when I'm recording

600
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,100
You know that guitar whole video or vlog right?

601
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,060
Sometimes I don't start with the point because I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just saying the fucking

602
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Correctly, there's one video of yours where you're like this game is just

603
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
good

604
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Capulary what's that?

605
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,880
My favorite of all time is hippo's line

606
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,820
It's got level design and like that was

607
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,380
Yeah, almost like any kind of setup at all is sort of

608
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
counterintuitive to

609
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,660
Like the the YouTube format as a medium like

610
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:41,180
Like in like in skits, for example, like you have a like a wacky character

611
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
showing up and

612
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,220
Something happens. You're having a conversation with like a cult corona and like

613
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,220
I like

614
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,420
Looking at it like as though it were like a movie or a TV show like

615
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,660
Screenwriting tells you that like there should like this this conversation needs to make sense

616
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,380
Yeah, yeah, and like the sentences need to flow together

617
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:10,660
But in a YouTube video that just makes it like long and take away from the point of the video and just boring and redundant

618
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,780
and what and what I eventually came to learn is to

619
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,940
Harness the inherent like popcorn II stupid stupidity of YouTube. So like

620
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,220
Cold corona doesn't need to come in and say this is why I'm here and this is what we're going to talk about

621
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:31,780
I can just like throw him in as a complete non sequitur for no reason but and just get to the goddamn joke

622
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,380
Tar like as in a centaur sequitur, what? Oh

623
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,500
Boy, oh boy

624
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,940
So as I was saying, you know, you can go into videos of going I'm gonna be concise

625
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,580
Well, I don't know if what I said made it's not necessarily easy

626
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:57,060
So when I started making videos like trying to do it professionally and all right what I'd come into is wow

627
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,700
I have this like interesting point to make how the fuck do I make it concisely?

628
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,060
So a lot of times I just didn't it took me like three paragraphs

629
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
But I could have written it in one paragraph

630
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:14,020
But I didn't know how to make that paragraph and what I there was one video in particular where I was talking about gravity falls

631
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,940
And shit and I was just like at the point. I was trying to make I felt like I needed

632
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,180
I needed three paragraphs to make the point because like

633
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:30,740
Basically, the first paragraph has the first 30% of the point then the second paragraph has the second 30% of the point and so on

634
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,300
But in order for those paragraphs to even make sense in the English language

635
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,260
I had to keep repeating the first percentages over and over again and just weaving more in each time

636
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,660
It's just it's just hard. It just takes a lot of legwork

637
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:47,940
You just have to listen to mr. B tongue videos on repeat every day. Yeah, I want to get into why I think it happens shit

638
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,780
And I'll also say of what Jesse was saying about cold corona like if you want to everyone should emulate

639
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:01,700
The existence of Cal Chuchesta as a side character in videos because you can watch any needle drop video and he never

640
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:09,500
Explains what the fuck Cal Chuchesta is he just shows up and says some weird shit in in like 30% of his videos

641
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:15,540
And you just kind of have to either know the lore of the channel or like you're just gonna go

642
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,640
Okay, well, I don't know what that was about, but it was funny, you know like

643
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,660
Because who cares what it actually is absent what who the fuck cares

644
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,260
But um the reason I think it happens where people repeat themselves so much is that

645
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,420
They feel like this point needs more weight than the amount of words

646
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,700
They can use for it and this happens to me a lot

647
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,460
Um and the biggest place I see this happening in anime analysis in particular is when trying to describe visuals

648
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,620
People will always say like the visuals of this show are really incredible

649
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,900
But they don't know how to explain that in more depth

650
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,140
So they say like the animation is really great the color design is really great

651
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,780
Yeah, the the way that things flow together is really great and they're basically just emphasizing again and again the point

652
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,780
They made already the visuals are really great

653
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,940
And it's cuz like

654
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:08,020
Unless you can pick apart like one moment to really dig into that then it's hard to

655
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,900
To describe that in broad terms, but there it's like you've got something in your brain

656
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:17,140
That's like no I have to make sure they understand they have to know how great the visuals are

657
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,460
This can't just be a flippant one-off point in the video

658
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,660
But you end up just repeating yourself ad nauseam and an example and like not to throw shade at this guy

659
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,300
Cuz I love him, but super eyepatch will just had a video about the newest season of samurai Jack

660
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,300
And he kind of does that with the visuals where he talks about it for like three minutes

661
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,780
Basically just emphasizing again and again how good the show looks and like the on-screen footage is doing all the leg work as it is

662
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,980
He didn't need to say anything. That's really the point that he's just trying to fill time so we can show you slides

663
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,020
It could very well be but like it obviously it doesn't that could be effective

664
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,740
But just make an AMV put an AMV in the middle of your video that'll do enough

665
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:01,780
Emphasizing one point over another doesn't can't just be made through the amount of words used it can be done through the tone of the words used like

666
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,100
Yeah, you know the character designers are fine

667
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:11,060
You know the locations are fine, but that mother fucking knows on the main character. So goddamn shoot moving on right

668
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:17,300
Forget that swears exist for emphasis. So that's why I like to use them to make things look

669
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:23,320
Yeah, I was actually just thinking about that from Homestuck after pages and pages probably novels worth of chat logs

670
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,700
There's one moment where the way that you read the chat log is slightly different to really emphasize an important sentence

671
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:35,260
And like obviously super eyepatch wolf does this because for him the most important thing is to say the title of the video

672
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,420
He's like why as dramatically as you should watch

673
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,780
Show

674
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:52,820
That shit cracks me up every time but like um, I think the best way to do it in is is to

675
00:54:53,860 --> 00:55:00,580
Like what I do with my composer videos were like, I know I can't say seven minutes worth of shit about an anime composer

676
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,660
So instead I'm just gonna play the fucking music and pop in every once in a while and say that was good

677
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:14,420
Like canapa has almost done something similar with animators except he talks almost too much because he will just keep repeating like and the

678
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,940
Animation here is drop dead gorgeous

679
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,540
And then he'll like play a clip and then he'll say and then over here the animation is so incredible

680
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,700
I like play I like I get it dude. Just make it just make a sake of a mad

681
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,940
Just have like an intro to it or something which I did that too with my

682
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,920
Videos that I always forget exist because they weren't on YouTube

683
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,580
Where I just like showed off like the early work of a bunch of like or it was directors who had previously been animators

684
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,100
And I had this video where it was basically an AMV where every once in a while

685
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,740
I'd cut in and say here's this guy and here's the stuff he did and then it's just another short AMV

686
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,500
You know cuz like yeah, sometimes you don't have enough words to really describe it

687
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,740
So like don't try to force the format on it

688
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,380
Be an analysis this particular brand of decisiveness you're talking about does not actually save you any time

689
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,580
It's just saving you a number of words wasted on the page

690
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,380
Yeah, well because it just sounds like shit when someone just keeps

691
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,500
Over and over again, you're like I fucking get it

692
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:21,820
You know just I feel like it's more effective if you just show it and and the audience will feel it emotionally, you know like

693
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:29,100
The Lucifer in the biscuit hammer video where you at no point or better example the girl in the gun part one

694
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,300
Like the bulk of that video is just an AMV with images showing your emotional reactions

695
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,580
Imagine how fucking garbage that video would be if instead of all those reactions

696
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:44,660
It was you describing your reactions to each moment and then that moment was so sad

697
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,780
Like in this moment was so uplifting none of the words it would it would be terrible

698
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,180
It would be awful to just oh my god

699
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,860
And then they got like twice as cool and then I was like four times as cool

700
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeah, and I mean that's all those visuals are really saying yes, but it makes you feel it the same way like you

701
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:07,860
You're just you're going from a face that looks shocked to a face that looks utterly shocked

702
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,340
Then a physical transformation of my body exactly a real man

703
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:18,380
And it's like we we feel what you felt we don't even have to see the show to understand what you were feeling and like it means

704
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,700
It just hits you way harder to see it that it would be to hear it and like that's

705
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:29,020
Perfect conciseness you basically summarized and reacted to an entire fucking show in four minutes

706
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,300
Presenting the full range of emotions you felt a video is a fucking masterpiece

707
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Absolutely a fucking masterpiece

708
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,820
You know what I'm kind of tired of is

709
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Blowing smoke up Nate's ass about his girl

710
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,220
Yeah, well

711
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:55,100
What I'm kind of annoyed with is people being you know, they got all their concise talking but now with

712
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:01,380
With more, you know super eye patch wolf nerd writer sort of breathy talkie sort of oh

713
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,340
Fucking so cool guys. They they give it

714
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,020
Just those two seconds of imitation were hilarious to me

715
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,300
Make a parody video give

716
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:20,220
Yes, but that there's never really enough breathing room for me to feel like any of it means anything

717
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:27,300
Oh, yeah, I agree because I'm editing a blood-borne video and I've I've got this whole big

718
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,860
Filmed live-action bit at the beginning and I didn't expect it to be like really long

719
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:37,860
But at the moment it's like literally the size of my actual analysis that comes afterwards

720
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,740
And it's so good just listen just watching it and seeing how slow it is

721
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:49,540
It sets the tone of the game and then also the review because I you know, I'm silly and it's like it's

722
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:57,460
It has I really like it. I was just watching it. I'm like, why don't why don't and that analytical videos

723
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:03,620
Have more than just a small pause and then a swell of music before going into a big old boring thing

724
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:10,260
Those guys are a little bit to one note like they really they stick in one emotional range when they don't understand

725
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:16,340
I mean if they're trying to make a grand point. I really think like my girl log in part two does that correctly

726
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,940
It's it's about building to a point and you could be silly and you want to catch people off guard and make them laugh

727
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,780
And surprise them and then at the end when you're making your grand point

728
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,780
It's at that point that you've earned the climax. That's when you hit them with like the big music

729
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:33,580
I literally can't watch Nerdwriter anymore because I feel like every video he makes is trying to make the exact same point

730
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:40,900
This thing is impressive. Yeah, or Captain Christian as well. Like it's always it's always just building up to like wow

731
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:48,860
They sure did think about that. They sure didn't work. They sure did their jobs and made something good, you know, like but um

732
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,340
someone who I think does that kind of dramatic presentation well is a

733
00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:01,660
Um body video where like it actually sucks you into the world. He's describing, you know, like he because it is like like

734
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:06,860
Hippo said with a nerdwriter. He's not slow enough. He's being slow to sound dramatic

735
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:11,980
Right, but then it just creates this kind of white noise feeling because not everything he's saying is dramatic body

736
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:18,300
I just feel just describing what's good about this movie and it's like this doesn't need this dramatic emotional

737
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,300
Wait, I don't think I was like a story teller

738
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:27,420
Is it all the stuff he's talking about is just the souls games which never get tired some of hearing about how great they are

739
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,820
Yeah, well and they have a consistent tone

740
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,940
So he can apply the same thing to every one and it it makes sense because you're always listening to

741
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:41,700
Because he's always making all the edits slick and I'm sure it's just because I make videos

742
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,020
But it always distracts me

743
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,740
Everything everything about nerdwriter distracts me now like because all I see is the artifice

744
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,740
Like I can't I can't even understand what he's talking about anymore

745
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:57,940
Cuz all I see is the artifice of the shit that he's been doing for two fucking years and has changed none of you know

746
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:03,700
Yeah, but like he always tries to like adjust the settings ever so slightly you never see quite the same thing, right?

747
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:09,340
You can just look at his thumbnail. It's the same feel and he has like 20 different fonts, right?

748
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:15,720
He really puts a lot of effort into typography and it's really distracting the typography is really distracting

749
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,840
It is it is great as I it's great on its own

750
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,680
But it's great in a way that takes away from it, you know

751
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,280
Just like I remember the day that I found the font that I use all the time now

752
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,880
That was a good day never had to think about what font to use is that the TBAP one

753
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:37,320
No, showcard gothic that was the TBAP one, but now I use Microsoft Tiley Microsoft Tiley. I'm all blue highway, baby

754
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:44,040
I know you are and I don't even think it looks good. I just it looks nice. It's fine. I'm gonna hate fonts

755
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,540
I'm getting pretty sick of blue highway at this point, but that's how I should feel. I don't want to change the font. It's like

756
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,120
Yeah, sorry hippo

757
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,200
Just to just to finish the blue highway point. Yeah, I I also like I mean I again

758
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,840
I don't even think it necessarily looks good. It's just that no one else uses it

759
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,000
So like it's so definitively mine that like and I don't know a better one, you know, so it's like fuck it

760
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,720
Let's just stick with this might as well. Okay. What were you saying though?

761
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,280
I was well, I was just saying I hate fonts and every time I have to choose a font is the fucking worst thing because I can

762
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,200
Never remember what fonts I've used before I never keep a record of it because I can't be able to type it down and then save a file somewhere

763
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,660
And then you know go on and use it forever. I

764
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,720
Can't remember them. I can never remember what I have been used

765
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:36,520
I I would recommend doing what Munchie did which is genius which he has a font called my script where it's just you turn your

766
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,520
handwriting into a font and

767
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:45,360
We use that for the s4 diaries like all of the like title cards and everything because Munchie had designed

768
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,880
The backgrounds for that and so if you watch like the ending of those videos

769
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,280
It's a great-looking font that he had of just his handwriting and like it was

770
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,680
Making fonts at age like 14

771
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,360
Yeah, I remember as other children are just finger banging in the backseat of mom's minivan

772
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:08,040
Just get serious kids get on Munchie's level remember CGP gray talking about how he like has

773
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,600
Specific fonts for specific purposes like there's one font that always is used if the words represent his own statement

774
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,800
From his own mind then he has another font that represents the collective opinion and another

775
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,960
Font that represents like straw man or something. I don't remember it's an early episode of hello internet

776
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,280
Where he breaks down like the different fonts that have different voices and I thought yeah

777
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,680
Fonds the thing the thing about that is that when I'm when I'm trying to type it like I need some text and I just go

778
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:43,720
Okay, let's get a font. I've never really prepared to think for any sort of a length of time about what font will be appropriate

779
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:49,240
So I feel like if I don't sit down and think about all these different fonts and which ones work for different things

780
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,640
I'm just gonna pick a random one every time because I can't be bothered to think about it because I just need the words on the screen

781
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,800
Yeah, yeah, what you should do is you should decide when you like you should use it in a video

782
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,800
And then what you should do is next time you're making a video open up that old Vegas project be like

783
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,400
Ah, yes, this is the file or this is the font I use and then use that and eventually you will just remember forever

784
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,040
There are font finder software. I did that like a website for my

785
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,520
Different give finishes point. Yeah, what we're saying

786
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,640
Well, I did that for my my pony reviews, but I got bored of it and now I can't I don't want to use it anymore

787
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,000
So now I just have a font that I will never use as opposed to a bunch of fonts that I will just randomly use at any time

788
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,440
Hey, Nate, let me finish this point. I intend to I am suffering with three-second lag here, brother

789
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,320
Boy person, okay, but yeah, there was talking over each other going on

790
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,800
So somebody had to go first. Okay, but in any case, I feel like we're done. I feel like we've hit the wall here

791
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,920
We're just kind of rambling. Why don't we go to questions? What do you think? We I'm okay with that

792
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:51,320
Monkey, did you want to talk about concise writing in fiction at all since you're here and haven't said shit? Yeah

793
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,280
In fiction or non-fiction Jesse wants to say something to her, and yeah, what Jesse, what were you gonna say?

794
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Jesse Jesse

795
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,280
Don't remember. God damn it. I felt like I had a lot to say about this topic, but then I got scared and became confused

796
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,160
Okay, well the monkey you can go on and then maybe you'll remember

797
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,160
Yeah, I mean just I've already kind of said it in terms of concise writing

798
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:21,440
You can never trust yourself because you know what point you want to make but that point not might not be clear to somebody else

799
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,280
Who is experiencing the writing for the first time so I would say

800
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:30,320
Always find a trusted friend or parent or teacher to just look over that shit and tell you if you sound like a retard or not

801
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:38,040
I don't have any friends and also maybe more than one because I've started to have some concern that

802
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,400
Because I pass all my scripts to DeVue and I just kind of count on like well if DeVue gets it

803
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,400
It's fine, but DeVue also will listen to my video over and over again

804
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:55,720
And is definitely gonna understand it by the time it goes out and then sometimes I think maybe both of us

805
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,840
Understand it better than the audience is going to yeah

806
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,680
Fair enough to be fair. I don't do that as much

807
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,680
I mostly listen to it like once and then I just sit on it for days

808
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,440
And then maybe I listen to it one more time and then I go into editing it the last couple of videos

809
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,880
I've done like that. So hopefully not I don't know

810
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,540
I just I do I worry sometimes that me and you are so steeped in my

811
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,720
Analytical voice that we will autumn like of course we get the point that I'm making

812
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,880
And then but I have some videos that I'll return to like six months later

813
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,720
Once I've forgotten what the point was that video and I watch it and there's certain parts or I'm like

814
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,560
I don't know if I was clear enough here

815
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:40,800
You know like oh, I don't know if I really like if the audience will really appreciate what I'm saying unless they watch the video twice

816
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:46,240
You know because sometimes I'm too concise and I guess we need a PCP editorial department

817
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:54,100
Yeah, well the funny thing is that I I think I am amazing at editing anyone else's stuff

818
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,600
Like if it would be you then yeah, it would just be me

819
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,760
But then somebody would have to do mine probably you know

820
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,480
And it would just have to be tell me if it makes sense or not and if not I'll go fix

821
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,560
I remember one time there is this website really ancient web

822
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:14,200
1.5 website that was like dude pay us to give you the service of us editing your

823
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,080
Writing your pros and it goes on and on about how you really can't notice the flaws in your own works

824
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,760
And it was just talking about how much you really needs to hire editors and we're here to serve you and the html

825
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,440
Was so fucked up that you couldn't even see half the text

826
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:33,720
It was like uncensored and all the buttons were too big and you couldn't it was like an absolute mess for website

827
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,240
They specced into editing too hard and didn't put it into web design. They thought that was just like huh irony

828
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
well, yeah, and it's funny too because

829
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:50,200
Because I used to always show my videos to Victor and I'd ask him like did you get all that like did you understand it and like

830
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:57,040
Half the time he's like yeah, of course because like Victor does think analytically too like a lot of the time stuff that I say

831
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,760
He thinks is obvious and he's like you mean to tell me that people wouldn't know this already and I'm like no most people are

832
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,560
Retard and don't think about anything

833
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:11,320
But then there's also stuff where I will present it to somebody and I'll say like did you get that and they'll say yeah

834
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:17,640
And it'll be like well, what what was the point I was making they're like, I don't know like I know I understood it

835
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,640
I just don't know what the hell it was about. I'm like, yeah

836
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,760
Understanding works. Well, it's kind of just consume stuff though. They don't really yeah

837
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:31,880
Well, I think there's a lot of people who like just like kind of watch the video and like they can tell that what I'm saying makes sense

838
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,560
Yeah, they just don't fully process it and like they just go. Yeah, that was smart like I can tell that was smart

839
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,320
Yeah, I don't know what you said though, you know, like well, that's the thing some people aren't

840
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,800
Analytically minded in that way and even if they did understand it like properly

841
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,960
They may not be able to communicate it because they're not good at that

842
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:57,720
Yeah, they wouldn't be able to tell you back at you. I think that's true Victor like I think Victor understands all my videos

843
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,080
And just can't explain it back to me

844
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,080
But I have had people who I know

845
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:07,000
Don't get it and and like cuz I could see it in their eyes. They have that deer in the headlights retard look, you know

846
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,840
It's kind of like me and me and Jesse were discussing

847
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,920
rap lyricists recently and how

848
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,160
We both think MF doom is overrated

849
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,320
Because everyone always talks about how amazing doom is for his like crazy rhyme schemes and stuff

850
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,000
But most of his lyrics are literal fucking nonsense

851
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,360
And I think it's just that people are so impressed by like

852
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:34,040
The fact that he's making all these rhymes and like in stuff that they don't like it just goes over their head

853
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,640
And they think well, I just don't understand it cuz it's too smart. That's a real a lot of a lot of rappers

854
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,480
I notice really

855
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,120
Tend to bog themselves down in the show-offy like internal rhyming

856
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,760
Right to a ridiculous point and it is you know, it is impressive

857
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:57,680
But a lot of them are also not saying anything. Yeah, like it's like rap like there's been a lot like yeah

858
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,480
Like some of the best rappers ever, you know weren't rhyming every single word

859
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,120
They were just saying statements that rhymed

860
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Yeah, like shake your fucking rapper

861
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,840
Yeah, if you don't see the vision if you don't see the vision in over your head. I'm floating

862
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,840
I got your girl deep throat

863
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,160
You're just not you're not up to stop which one is that that's a drop God somewhere. I think I

864
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,280
Could be rap God is like I mean in fairness rap God is like about the idea that he doesn't have to make a point

865
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,040
He's just flexing nuts, but that's why it's an obnoxious fucking piece of shit song

866
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,880
Hey

867
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,080
Wisdom in what is a juggalo? I don't know but you ask what it is. Well fuck if I know

868
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:50,640
Like showing shit to our family, you know like I have some pretty decent resources for that because I could I have my dad, right?

869
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,640
And my dad is someone who is?

870
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,800
Intellectual and is analytical and open-minded

871
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:03,160
But is like a baby boomer who has literally no interest or point of reference for anything

872
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,600
I care about and always forgets everything that I tell him after I'm done explaining it

873
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,000
so basically I'm able to use him as like a

874
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,640
Mechanism to like if I can explain something in a way that he gets and is mildly interested by then I know I'm doing it correctly

875
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,040
Like one time I explained Sonic OCs to him, right?

876
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:27,240
So first I had to explain Sonic and then the adventure era and then the concept of fandom and then OCs and he was like oh

877
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,920
Okay, and I can tell in his face when he's getting something or not

878
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,400
So yeah, yeah, you can use your family

879
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,520
You can't bother them and waste their time and waste their life

880
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,000
To help my kids good for that as well

881
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,480
Except that he has such a short attention span that somewhere in the middle

882
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,200
He'll like notice something out of the corner of his eye and it'll completely make him wipe all memory of the conversation

883
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,400
He's having he's a squirrel like a human squirrel

884
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,160
My brother as well. My brother is I guess I'm going down the list here

885
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:02,760
Just so that you guys can compare it to your own families and think about what resources you have in them because like my brother is someone who

886
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,880
Can appreciate all the things that I appreciate in art, but has an

887
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,960
Unbelievably short fuse for giving for no longer giving a shit

888
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,240
So it's like if anything isn't perfect then he's gonna be like, okay, I'm done with this

889
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,680
So it's like he's a pretty good useful to I was like explaining to my brother a lot of my ideas for for a video game

890
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,440
And like he was on he was nodding his head at all of them

891
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,760
Unfucking presidented with me telling him my ideas. So that really was a good sign for me

892
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Yeah, what are we still going to questions I

893
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,200
Still okay, I have two points two pieces of advice

894
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,640
Keeping it in the realm of like you writing concisely for YouTube because that's what I know

895
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,640
That's our area of expertise

896
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:58,720
I have two pieces of advice that I've thought of during this for writing concisely as I explained that I have these two pieces of advice as

897
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,640
Inconsisely as possible by repeating myself 50 times the first piece of advice is

898
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,000
Never write an intro don't do it intros are always bad

899
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,640
They're always a waste of time right just if it if you want to do like a like a skit

900
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:23,920
Or like a funny aside put it in the middle of the video because no one's going to sit through an intro to get to your point

901
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:30,040
But if you just start throw them right in there to the point then they'll see that and get to whatever else other

902
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,920
Tell them to not watch the video, which is what you do half the time just like this video isn't good. Don't watch it

903
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,520
Yeah, because yeah

904
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,840
Audience I warn them when a video is garbage to piggyback on that a little bit

905
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:49,080
I'll say I think I think a lot of why intros get written is that people don't know how to start their paper or whatever

906
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,120
Like they're just looking for a way to like get the juices rolling

907
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,240
So I'll say write an intro and then delete it like once you've got the ball rolling and you figure out what you're saying

908
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,840
Just go back and delete the intro. I don't I think it comes from that, you know

909
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,000
High school college you have to have this many words

910
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,080
You have to have a thesis that is three seconds long your thesis doesn't have to be so many sentences long

911
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,480
It can be one word you get one sentence this thing is cool the end then get to the fucking point

912
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,480
I mean if you saw like my last video

913
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,920
My last video had the thesis in the title and I don't even say it in the like the title

914
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,840
Yeah, like how much does

915
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:30,280
Visuals matter in anime and then the first sentence video is obviously it's a matter of opinion, you know

916
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,920
So I just didn't yeah never write intros don't waste anyone's time

917
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,560
It's just jump into it you you have the compulsion to think that you'll lose people by jumping into it

918
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,760
But you won't the opposite is true and this is um

919
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:49,000
This is something that I've learned by sucking at it for very long and very slowly coming to terms with how to write for YouTube

920
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:55,800
Particularly and the other piece of advice that that I've learned mainly by sucking at it myself for many years before I

921
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:02,000
Slowly got the hang of it. Um is not every video has to be mr. Plinkett

922
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:10,280
Yeah, there's the compulsion especially for like people who write analysis type videos of

923
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:16,360
This video about this thing has to say everything about this thing

924
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:23,320
I'm gonna encompass the entire scope of it. Sometimes it works out. Well, you know Nate's Gurren login is a great video

925
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,760
But even that's in two parts. Um, yep

926
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,800
Yeah, I used to do that all the time and

927
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,960
It would really hamstring me because I'd say this. Yeah, you know what?

928
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,720
You know what YouTube review show suffers for trying to make every episode mr. Plinkett same to me

929
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,120
What's that mr. Plinkett that's true

930
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,600
Mr. Plinkett show itself has all these episodes that are trying to be mr. Plinkett and don't need to be and I'm just like what's like

931
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:54,040
No, what are you talking about? I think he means like like babies day out didn't have to be a 45 minute video

932
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:59,800
No, that was a 23 minute video and it was freeing because they all thought he was gonna do episode 3 of Star Wars

933
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,920
Then he did a kids movie. Yeah, that was fine. That's a joke

934
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:08,040
But like you know like say the um the Indiana Jones one that was just like the only point

935
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:16,000
I can actively remember is they don't have any violence that that was the Indiana Jones video is very meandering and all over the place

936
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,480
I feel like he was trying to force an hour of content out of it

937
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:24,120
And it was just like exploring like what they can do in the future like what sort of content will work

938
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,900
Like are we really just gonna have to do Plinkett forever? I don't like that was early days

939
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,220
I think they were still

940
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:35,200
I mean it's my point is that you can really hamstring yourself by trying to put everything into a single video

941
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,280
And you won't get as much content out as fast as possible. You won't improve me a math of that

942
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,040
Yeah, and I'm you know like for example, I'm looking right now

943
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:50,600
And at like an old like a gun buster my Japanese anime is that I wrote two years ago, and it's like 25 pages long

944
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,400
Yeah, I never got around to actually making it because I'm looking at these 25 pages of words

945
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,840
And I'm like I don't want to edit all of this

946
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,320
But now I'm looking at it years later and just thinking well wait a minute

947
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:08,480
I can clearly split this up into like four different videos if I yeah, and that would be like way easier and actually getting made that way

948
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,280
So just just don't not everything else

949
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,680
And I think that's the problem with like the extra credits problem where we've explained all the shit

950
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,400
I don't need analysis to exist anymore. I know it all now

951
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:29,600
But the whole point of continuing to make pieces in an artistic medium for the incoming generations

952
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,400
Is you have to keep making the point to people so I feel like we just need kids analysis

953
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,600
We need like specifically PBS Nerdwriter that is just like telling you all the basic shit

954
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:46,880
The cartoon dog talks about ludonarrative dissonance and you have a fucking moose comes in and talks about Xomkin's work, right?

955
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,520
And that way like all the adults can just focus on higher-minded shit

956
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,800
I'm glad Jesse brought all that up because me and Nate were literally talking about this last night

957
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,040
I think during the interview that yeah

958
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,520
This will be out the Nate interviews gonna be out

959
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:10,440
So I interviewed me and we were talking about how there was kind of this perception that we all had back in 2015

960
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,960
Where like we all looked up to 45 minute long

961
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,560
hyper detailed analysis like you know like mr. Beaton on Mass Effect or

962
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,560
Mr. Plinkett or

963
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:26,920
Sequelitis and like we all had this idea like that's the ultimate video. That's what we should all be trying to do

964
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:33,240
That's what matters the most and Nate did Girl in the Gone Part 2 and Jesse did the drowning in horse shoes videos leading up to

965
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:38,840
Horseshoe finale and I did the SAO videos the the asterisk war which I mean asterisk war at least split into parts in like a

966
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,760
Big way, you know

967
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,120
But like we all had this idea of like it has to be the biggest possible thing

968
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,880
And what that it yeah what eventually happens is you never make it

969
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,800
And then you end up with like more than one of those like it's one thing if you have one

970
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:57,080
You know you have to do right girl in the gone. It had to happen to be done, you know and like

971
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,000
There's there's a couple that I think probably I still have to do

972
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:01,720
You know

973
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:07,880
But like one of the biggest hurdles I ever got over as a creator was deciding not to write a book about ava

974
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:14,280
And just to make videos about whatever ideas I had about ava and and now I have like eight hyper successful

975
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,720
Evangelion videos and I still could make like 20 more

976
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,360
as the ideas come to me, but

977
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,120
Those would not be out

978
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:27,560
Like if I was still in the mindset that I have to make one giant ava video there would still be no ava video

979
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,040
And it's question. That's how stuff becomes that's how stuff becomes too much of a burden

980
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:36,200
That's how you get buried under your own ideas. That's how a boy gets trapped in the furnace room

981
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,760
And you don't want that you don't want that you do not what there's a spooky pattern there. Watch out

982
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,640
That's spooky bad video actually freaked me out. Oh man that that that bad is so scary

983
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,880
You don't even know guys every day

984
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,280
I watched that I watched that video

985
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,000
I watched that video while I was alone in a hotel room

986
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,880
And like the the music kind of got into my head and I went outside to have a smoke and I was just kind of like

987
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:06,680
Guys, we should make this this kids analysis show the the subtext submarine the vinid the venetian

988
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,640
Go to patreon.com slash to procrastinators

989
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,880
Whatever the fuck you are ls if we get ten thousand dollars, we will get hippo to animate

990
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,960
Uh, the animated series talking about analysis that way everyone

991
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:29,160
From write out the fucking womb. It'll just be our animal characters. Yeah explaining at analytical points. That sounds great

992
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:35,880
Real quick just for clarification for audience members who may be feeble minded such as myself all the points you just made

993
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:41,560
How does that comparable to at the beginning of this when you said you put all your points in one video

994
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:46,760
Whereas anime snob separates them into separate videos like is that kind of the same idea?

995
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,400
Well, what what I mean to say is like

996
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,680
I it's not that I put every idea into one video

997
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:57,960
It's that my videos tend to go through various points like my videos go through stages. It's always like

998
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,560
However many points. I think belong in this video, you know

999
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:07,960
Like um, I recently did this video series about miss Kobayashi's dragon maid and it was planned to be three videos

1000
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,760
And it's just because I had a shitload of points

1001
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:16,680
And I said well, let's break like I don't want to make a 45 minute video because it's not cost effective

1002
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,560
To do that. So let's split it into 15 minute parts

1003
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:25,000
And I had just enough notes about the main character to make one 17 minute video about her

1004
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:29,000
Then I had enough notes about the other characters to make one 13 minutes video about them

1005
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:35,240
And then I had enough notes about the art and animation that I can make a third video whenever I feel like it, you know, so like

1006
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,680
Like those videos are

1007
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:44,520
Fairly long individually, but it's because they're going through all of the points that I thought needed to be in one video

1008
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:50,120
Like everything about Kobayashi. So it's kind of like five that anime snob videos in one video

1009
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:55,320
I mean the real problem at the end of the day with anime snob is that the entire video is a waste of time because he's just wrong

1010
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,640
He is just wrong. That's I mean, that's the worst part

1011
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:05,080
Like don't don't take this as me in in any way endorsing the way he does things like his style of video could make sense

1012
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,120
It's just that he's literally retired. Yeah

1013
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Yeah, yeah good anime

1014
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:18,040
So 17 a Pomeranian talks about post modernism. I'll work on my puns. Don't worry

1015
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,480
Okay, I I have a tip for for conciseness

1016
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,480
um

1017
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,720
Stop writing clever youtube titles. I don't like it when

1018
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:35,720
They there you just stop it. This is a personal thing. He's on the war. What does that have to do with conciseness?

1019
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,160
Because if you just write the name of the thing plus analysis or review, I wouldn't I'm

1020
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,520
Way more likely to click on it if I don't know what it is

1021
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:49,720
If you're trying to convince me to click on a video about the 10 secret hidden things and subtexts

1022
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,600
That nobody has noticed about this other thing or anime

1023
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,440
I I don't know the anime to begin with. Honestly hippo at this point

1024
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,280
I would prefer numbers and exclamation marks because I've at this point gotten

1025
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:06,440
completely sick of the nerd writer style of like the eloquent sentence that sounds all dramatic and hyphalutin, you know like

1026
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,040
How this thing captures that just shit, you know like

1027
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,360
It seems to work though

1028
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,800
Yeah, it seems like it but it works

1029
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:20,120
It works on the sort of people who think they know everything and would like to know the secret special extra things that supers intelligent people

1030
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,320
I just want to know stuff. I just want to know about a thing

1031
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,760
We will our fans will watch our stuff, but if we want to bring in new people

1032
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,200
We have to trick them into watching the video to give them good people. They think they're smart

1033
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,280
Well, I do because I want to fucking survive on this shit patrons if you don't bring in new

1034
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,280
I will kill all the people

1035
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,680
I hate them. I mean hippo stupid. What do you think of my titles hippo?

1036
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,560
I can't remember give me a title you have

1037
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,480
How I learned to stop worrying and and skip a cashew records

1038
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,280
Or uh, well that one's funny. That one's got like a yeah, that one's a reference. So

1039
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,680
In a very well-known reference. What's the one I did on kimono friends the lucid dream world of kimono friends?

1040
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,760
I don't know. What do you think? I mean hippo. What book are you more likely to read?

1041
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,960
satire about women or men are better than women

1042
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,720
Like do you want the honest title or the cool title?

1043
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,640
I want the cool one. I'm sorry. What I'm saying is I think you're talking about something more specific than what we're

1044
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,160
Saying you're talking. Well, what hippo is saying is like

1045
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,000
We should name everything like avan galley in review number five like why not give it a no, no, no, no, no

1046
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,800
No, no, no, no, no what I mean is that people

1047
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,200
they I've just seen but just recently there's like every single type of video

1048
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:38,000
in that in that of that ilk seems to be under the assumption that you already

1049
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,640
know the basics and you're looking for some extra shit and I will never click

1050
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,280
on anything that implies that I know what I what I you know like a nerdwriter

1051
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,480
videos every title is trying to play into your desire to be smart right like

1052
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,080
he's constantly trying to reassure you that by watching his video you are

1053
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,480
gaining an arcane knowledge that will make you stronger or give you a deep

1054
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,840
appreciation for this cultural touchstone that everybody already understands

1055
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,160
give you that nerd credit is so valuable and today's social economy oh my like I

1056
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:13,880
would much rather just watch a straight review of something that everybody is

1057
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:17,440
seen but I haven't no no game reviews for you hug you

1058
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,600
let's say like Seinfeld right and I have never seen like a normal straight

1059
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:29,160
review of Seinfeld and but I have seen plenty of annoying like extra videos

1060
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,000
about the subtext and the extra things that you you know Seinfeld everyone

1061
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,440
know Seinfeld here's some more I will never never enjoy that people complaining

1062
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,200
about things that everyone's talking about on the internet that I haven't

1063
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:46,120
heard like you know my introduction to Ludo narrative dissonance was movie was

1064
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,120
the game over thinker episode called stop talking to me about Ludo narrative

1065
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:56,160
dissonance and my second exposure to it was someone else being like oh god yeah

1066
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:00,760
it was Jimquisition talking about Ludo scabib disco biscuits like oh jeez so

1067
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,840
much Ludo narrative dissonance out there since everyone just spent all their

1068
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:09,120
day reading blog posts by shitty blog artists like me Jimquisition I'm like

1069
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:14,160
no I don't know you're the only person I listen to that complains about this but

1070
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:18,800
if we can't have an intro where we tell people the basics and we also like can't

1071
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,480
assume everybody knows everything what are we supposed to do well I'm not

1072
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,360
talking about intros I'm talking about entire videos like if you know they're

1073
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,960
part of entire video simple this is what we need the fucking we have a

1074
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:35,000
German chef about German expressionism we have a fucking monkeys looking sorry

1075
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:46,520
sorry sorry whatever sorry simultaneously trying to say that you

1076
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,840
should like not just do summary but that you should also in hippo wants like

1077
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,120
standard reviews but what hippos means is that he wants there to be videos that

1078
01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:00,120
are just a actual review of the thing without assuming that everyone's already

1079
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:05,680
seen it it's really all it is is that it's the the flowery and the insinuation

1080
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:09,800
of the title that makes me not want to click on it like if you if you are

1081
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,440
talking about say the content of the video is exactly the same if you just

1082
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,880
title it Seinfeld analysis then I'm gonna click on it because I want to know

1083
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,080
but I think most people wouldn't click on that you gotta play the game title well

1084
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:27,160
I hate YouTube then fair enough yeah I think hippo would title yeah I think

1085
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,160
hippo would click on it if you said like why is Seinfeld so well loved you know

1086
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,280
if that was the title you'd probably click on that because that's what you're

1087
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,480
trying to find out well maybe not at this point because I just I just generally

1088
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:47,240
hate titles video titles they got to go they got to go yeah your channel

1089
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:52,120
banner your channel banner for hypocrites should just be the words I'm gonna

1090
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:58,920
kill you you know you are the hypocrites so it's entirely appropriate that you

1091
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,000
make YouTube videos about how much YouTube sucks and is a piece of shit yep

1092
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:08,800
well all right how about we go to the questions now team let's do it let's do

1093
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,800
it here we go I feel no ill will towards anyone I am just I don't like

1094
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:21,640
YouTube I don't like seeing titles I don't like seeing titles and reading

1095
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:25,920
them and having to decide on whether or not I hate it I mean why would you want

1096
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,440
to review a show you like like why would you want to Seinfeld review if you know

1097
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,160
nothing about it anyway couldn't you just read a summary to see if you'd be

1098
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,080
into because Gibbs heard a lot about Seinfeld over the years so they just

1099
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:39,840
fucking watch it well I can't have a television I don't know I think of an

1100
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,200
analysis is good and interesting you'll just sort of inadvertently get all the

1101
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,880
shit and eventually know all the obvious stuff I'm not really I'm not really

1102
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,160
looking for a Seinfeld analysis I'm just I just don't like people being smart I

1103
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,560
don't like people having smart that's really my entire point if you're trying

1104
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,400
to be smart I hate you in forever like after watching like a combined total of

1105
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:03,520
like 15,000 hours of Roger Vanderweed analyzing Sonic I already I now know all

1106
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,480
the basic stuff without him ever actually attempting to explain basic stuff

1107
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:14,120
just through inference mm-hmm so here we go people question number one read this

1108
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:21,320
question Nate here I go okay at our old friend ice killer 159 asks yo PCP you

1109
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,120
get to experience a piece of media for the first time again what do you choose

1110
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:34,200
between a attorney and death question oh man yeah where you go Elton whoa whoa

1111
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:38,320
definitely lost that's my answer I already know it lost huh even with the

1112
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:45,320
ending oh yeah that's that we know is bad especially oh is bad this is this is

1113
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,960
my communist classes are not fucking orange anyone who says the ending of

1114
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,960
losses bad I'll fucking find you and I'll kill your whole family Jesse I think

1115
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,320
you are as passionate about every opinion you actually end up caring about as

1116
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,400
much as Nate is about the glasses thing like I think for you it's like 99% of

1117
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,400
opinions you immediately discard because you know that if you let your

1118
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,600
opinions sit there for more than five seconds it's gonna become like a hill to

1119
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:14,880
die on I'm passionate about all of my opinions equally until I remember how I

1120
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:19,880
feel about lost and then I'm passionate about nothing

1121
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,920
if I could read what I was sorry hippo go ahead now you go okay if I could

1122
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,120
experience something for the first time again it would have to be the final

1123
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,960
three episodes of season four of Breaking Bad I don't think anything has

1124
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,720
enthralled me as a viewer more than what was happening so the first of the

1125
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,760
three is the crawlspace episode which is very famous where he laughs at the end

1126
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,440
and goes yeah yeah god damn I that that was the bingiest binge watch I've ever

1127
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,320
been I'll tell you and that was the cringiest cringe watch I've ever cringed

1128
01:30:49,320 --> 01:31:03,160
oh your show sucks for my answer for this like going on most of the like with

1129
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:08,080
most movies and TV shows I tend to like it more the more times I see it so like

1130
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:12,400
most of those I feel like I wouldn't want to hear or see for the first time

1131
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:18,160
but like any album that I like for me like the most magical time with an album

1132
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:22,320
is when I'm first getting into it and it feels mysterious and like I can't tell

1133
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,440
the difference between all the songs yet and it's just like like for instance

1134
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,920
Rat King so it goes is a great example where I was like playing this album on

1135
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,000
repeat while playing fantasy star online for a few days and it would just be like

1136
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,520
you know as it's going I pick up on little things I'm like oh here's that

1137
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,120
song I remember hearing this part and like it just feels like this endless

1138
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:46,320
magical you know like just getting to hear all these different things that I

1139
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,520
didn't know about and then eventually once I've heard the album enough times

1140
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,880
and I know exactly what's where that's where I start forming opinions like oh

1141
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,720
this song's a little weaker than the others so I might skip that track or

1142
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:01,160
like oh this is the good verse this is the you know that part like oh now I

1143
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,440
now I've got like all these opinions about it and I don't have that sheer

1144
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,640
just wonder of experience something I don't completely understand yet so like

1145
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:14,160
especially longer albums like third side of tape by Lil ugly main because that

1146
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,120
one's like too over two hours long and it's just like a random compilation of

1147
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:23,000
weird songs that that are like all completely different from one another

1148
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,680
so it was always like this total mind-altering experience to listen to

1149
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,320
it until I'd heard it like 30 times and now it's like oh okay this is the part

1150
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:35,160
where the obnoxious 10-minute black metal song kicks in let's skip that you

1151
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:40,640
know yeah yeah so yeah any album really okay okay

1152
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,440
what about the human equation do you want to hear the human equation again

1153
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:48,840
human equation would be yeah that's that's an example of one that in the

1154
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:54,560
early days was like very mysterious I believe the human equation is pussy plus

1155
01:32:54,560 --> 01:33:04,560
my face a happy boy did you are we still doing a PCP episode over the human

1156
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,680
equation it's on the list if anybody else fucking listens to it we'll get

1157
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,000
the boo and Nate and that's all we need I'll listen to it listen to it we'll

1158
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,520
fucking make you listen to it did you hear over at his house force him tie him

1159
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,880
up clockwork orange style only price ears open instead of his eyes I'll knock

1160
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,880
him out and then put it like tie him to a chair and then he'll wake up he'll go

1161
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:31,800
I can't move I don't remember what's happening now I don't remember anything

1162
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:37,000
you fucking pleb by the way my answer this question without a doubt without a

1163
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,640
doubt is certainly one piece I want to take that journey again knowing nothing

1164
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:44,120
and luckily for you it's not over yet so you still can that's the great thing

1165
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,760
about it man you should you guys I want to tell our audience you have never

1166
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,720
heard someone read something more enthusiastically than Nate rage one

1167
01:33:51,720 --> 01:34:01,980
piece I'm sitting in the other room and just hearing Naco oh my god go check

1168
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,600
out the new episode oh my god I didn't finish this fucking video yet I have to

1169
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,520
make it I totally forgot yeah make that shit I'll make it today go check out the

1170
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:12,560
new episode it'll be up like last week at this point of the potty cast and like

1171
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:17,680
the things that happen to this chapter really were yet again the most

1172
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:23,800
blowing things of all time it really scared me I was actually terrifying and

1173
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,760
like beyond it was a new fun level I'm glad to find out that I'm not the only

1174
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,160
like the only the only loud reader who passionately I scream I yell I like

1175
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:37,440
like when I read comics I like I do all the voices out loud and I like pace

1176
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:41,200
around the room doing my Kevin Conroy voice and my fucking Joker voice and

1177
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,200
like if anyone if anyone else is in the house and I don't know about it and they

1178
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,160
hear me have to go out of the house screaming and never come back if you

1179
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,640
read a comic quietly everything goes according to plan there's no problem

1180
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,280
but but you read a comic and you get a little loud everyone loses their mind

1181
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,960
if I read a comic quietly then it's not really happening it's just a fake made

1182
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,600
up a little book for kids if I read it out loud and the characters are really

1183
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:07,320
here then it's real then it's real hip-hop did you have an answer for this I

1184
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:14,640
I do being a many years veteran of World of Warcraft I'm very I'm very

1185
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:19,120
disillusioned with it I'm very like tired of the high what happens with

1186
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,600
World of Warcraft the reason it grips so many people is because the initial

1187
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:26,640
experience of seeing how big the world is in all the places there are is

1188
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:31,320
absolutely fucking magical as the best part of love with it and you just you

1189
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,960
want to live there you want to go you want to do everything and I have I've

1190
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:37,920
done literally everything in that game aside from the current expansion and to

1191
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,560
the point where it nothing excites me anymore and it really it really is sad

1192
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:46,560
because it's like so much so so cool that's the my fucking that's a great

1193
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,880
answer and I feel that way about every MMO I've played sure like with wow it

1194
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,600
was specifically just the undead starting country because playing through

1195
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,320
that was fucking magical and then I got to the next area which was like the

1196
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,960
badlands that thought it was lame so I just restarted and played through the

1197
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,400
starting undead place like three times and just until I completely knew it and

1198
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,880
then it was not as interesting hey same goes for like Terra or Black Desert like

1199
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,280
any of those games when you first started it's just like whoa this this world

1200
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,280
it's so huge about the soul the soul starting area was great but I love that

1201
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,840
fucking place fucking trolls are the best race everyone else is shit and wow

1202
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,000
only trolls are good you have a you have an answer to do yes actually as I was

1203
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,360
thinking about it everything that I liked at one point then over consumed I

1204
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:35,120
don't want to regress to a point of not having ever experienced it because it

1205
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,440
was instrumental in my understanding of what makes things good and you know I

1206
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,320
use it as an influence so I don't want to fuck with the timeline that badly sure

1207
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:46,960
my god you're right to who because if I went back in time to when I hadn't seen

1208
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,800
lost I might listen to people who say the ending is bad exactly what I want

1209
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,280
there's this stupid dumbass show called the pretender which is sort of like a

1210
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:02,440
proto like like hour-long weekly American drama type of thing that like alias

1211
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,400
and lost sort of followed up on and it's like a late 90s thing has a lot of

1212
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:11,160
weird superficial similarities with alias actually and it has an interesting

1213
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,520
sort of character premise but it is the Ranma one half of America because it

1214
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,840
just it doesn't progress anything ever and it's four seasons long and I just

1215
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,560
watched it because I was watching it with my family huge ways to fucking time so

1216
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:27,680
if I it did not like you know there's other shows that like I didn't like and

1217
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:31,800
like I regret watching but I don't regret watching because it was it's like fun

1218
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,680
and I think it's interesting how they fuck up the pretender is just mediocre

1219
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,200
and stupid and it was just the one time in my life or for whatever reason I was

1220
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,560
willing to waste that much time and not expand my knowledge of anything ever for

1221
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,640
any reason whatsoever so if I can erase my viewing from history and then have to

1222
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:52,800
begin watching it again my current self will have no tolerance for it and turn

1223
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,960
it off immediately and I'll have saved myself like a combined total of like 50

1224
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:06,760
hours so you do it all for those 50 hours yeah use all of it on D you know

1225
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,760
what he means yeah the D board okay so that's everybody right we've all gone

1226
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,200
through this yep let's I've got here's another question that I absolutely love

1227
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:24,300
okay here we go so this is at pond itator asks at PCP who is the hottest

1228
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:29,520
sailor scout I've spent a lot of time you don't know the well enough it's

1229
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,920
absolutely marz is not even a contest not even a doubt wait it's Mars the black

1230
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,720
hair the sailor Mars is the black hair I thought it was the coolest guy you've

1231
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:45,600
ever seen the only male one oh that's all that's obvious you're right but aside

1232
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,720
aside from the coolest guy I'm looking at up I'm looking at a pop vinyl sailor

1233
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:55,440
Mars right now yeah it's got a picture of all of them lined up next to each

1234
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,960
other and Mars is like far and away the hottest the only other one that I like

1235
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:05,160
I mean I do appreciate Jupiter but Mars is by far the best I never seen sailor

1236
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:09,400
moon now I'm just kidding the hottest one is homura I don't know who that is

1237
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:15,440
from come out of magic is that is that is that cat like like the cat from

1249
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:49,360
sucks a dad get it okay let's move on to this question this is dead air let's

1250
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:55,760
okay here we go here we go at our hero monkey away asks a very apropos question

1251
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,880
what's stopping the other PCB members from doing their own me a math of a

1252
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:04,680
yes I don't know if this is supposed to be an insult he says standards or work

1253
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,760
ethic like no one else has low enough standards or they don't have low enough

1254
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:14,880
work ethic to make I came up with one concept where I do a video every day

1255
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:22,880
all year called 2018 too cool zero fucks given one video a day you're going to

1256
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:28,740
hate all of them which is pretty great I do like that a lot I did fucking me a

1257
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:32,860
for three years ago you asshole you didn't brand it hard enough I didn't

1258
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:36,340
brand it at all he didn't brand it all it was a secret it was a secret because

1259
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,220
he had money on the line as to whether or not he would succeed and if you

1260
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:42,820
fail a lot of money would have ran away with the money yeah Nate you had to pay

1261
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:46,940
me for that right you bet against me and I think you gave me 10 bucks I don't

1262
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:49,260
think I actually was in on that bet I would have bet against you if I know

1263
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:52,740
you were in on the bet I don't know if you ever paid out but you were in on it

1264
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:56,340
are you sure about that yeah I know you were because Ben Ben was the only one of

1265
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:00,220
the PCP who wouldn't bet against me because he said he wanted to bet for me

1266
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,140
and I was like you can't do that and I will give you ten dollars I think you

1267
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:06,620
might have it's possible I really don't remember being involved at all but I'll

1268
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:11,860
trust you here's my theory I'm talking about is in 2014 I made a video every

1269
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:16,940
day in October and I made bets with like everyone I knew like to see if like you

1270
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:21,300
know to incentivize me to do it right mostly it was my mom and dad who like

1271
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:25,420
we're betting the most and and they're the only ones I like really hammered to

1272
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:29,580
pay me but like yeah it made bets with like everybody but I didn't like announce

1273
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,980
that I was doing it because I was scared if I did it wouldn't get completed as

1274
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,900
tends to be the case when I announced projects so it was only like at the very

1275
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:41,380
end of the month that I acknowledged that I had just done this thing whereas

1276
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:45,700
Nate like made it very clear opposite because you'll get bored if I announce

1277
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:51,300
it then I have to do it or else I won't yeah well speaking of that I had an

1278
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:58,260
idea of doing a July me a math I don't know what I should well I mean in the

1279
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:03,660
meantime you've got your I know it's demon dark blood month bro it's not

1280
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:07,380
really the same but it's it's good similar I like it's more than one it's

1281
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:10,860
more than zero videos I want to say what I usually record all of us are

1282
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:16,460
insanely prolific in that kind of way of me a math of a like Gibbon has had months

1283
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:20,180
where he puts out videos like almost every day on Gibbon take Jesse's had

1284
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:24,700
months where he's put out a video almost every day just on random channels and I

1285
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:30,420
do literally put out a video every day like hey there's the air a furnace room

1286
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:33,820
has no breaks there's been a video every single day that's in addition to pony

1287
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:38,180
cast it's in addition to other videos and other channels I also I did do a video

1288
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,020
every day in October of 2013 and I'm still bearing the emotional stress from it

1289
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:47,300
most of those are hidden now but that that was right right I had an idea to

1290
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:53,900
like do like next year do like me a math of a to maybe I'll actually make a video

1291
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:57,900
but like the joke would be that I don't make a video and like I said maybe right

1292
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:06,060
you said maybe I don't actually have to do it great even that would have been too

1293
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:10,060
much work for me I'll just say it here

1294
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:15,220
let's say here's a simple matter of like crop rotation we're like going out into

1295
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:19,780
the world and watching movies and like being a real person to like form actual

1296
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:25,100
opinions is like planting cotton and then yeah making a video explaining your

1297
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:29,460
shit is like planting corn and I think like someone like mr. B tongue right

1298
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:33,620
spent like 30 years just being a normal guy probably writing a lot of college

1299
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:37,460
papers or some shit but never airing out any of his thoughts and then over the

1300
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:41,940
course of a couple years he just drops absolute gold and then he runs out and

1301
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:45,260
he only comes back once a year to like have another little bit of corn yeah so

1302
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,180
for me I'm just kind of that's why that's really why I don't have any problem

1303
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:52,020
with not making any videos I'm just I'm just fucking planting cotton up my ass

1304
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:56,980
guys and it's gonna all shoot out one day and incredible rainbow I think I think

1305
01:44:56,980 --> 01:45:00,620
everyone needs to understand about me a math of a is that that that thing

1306
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,100
wouldn't have been possible if not for the fact that Nate had not been doing

1307
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:10,860
that for the last two years because 30 ideas in a row is a hell of a lot because

1308
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:15,620
our work is all based on other stuff like it's not like Casey Neistat where

1309
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:19,300
he just goes out and literally films his day every day and half the videos are

1310
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,820
the exact same like he goes to the airport he flies to another country he

1311
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,940
goes somewhere like we have to every single time have something new to talk

1312
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:31,580
about and it's one thing if you go two years making one video every two months

1313
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:34,620
you've got this huge stockade of shit you've been planning to talk about that

1314
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,580
you've never gotten around to and then just boom blow through a bunch of it in

1315
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:42,500
a month but if Nate tried to do me a math of a again right afterwards then

1316
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:46,860
suddenly it's gonna be oh shit I'm out of ideas you know that's absolutely true

1317
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:51,980
I there were plenty in that October is that I fucking completely like at the

1318
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:55,860
end of the month you'll see the last like five videos are just like really

1319
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:59,540
struggling to come up with something I do have a bunch of ideas that I you know

1320
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:01,860
was just stockpiling to put as potential stuff but I picked the ones that I

1321
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:05,780
thought were the best but but more so than that what what is interesting to me

1322
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:10,140
about me a math that makes it sort of special I guess is that it really was

1323
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:16,380
very time-bounded and like a one-time thing and it was an event like I to do

1324
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:20,300
it even to do it for a year I really think people would get bored even if I

1325
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,620
was delivering content you know better than ever and just doing that same shit

1326
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:27,460
I don't think people would give a fuck after a while which is for you know

1327
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:30,380
variety people are into variety they want to feel like something special is

1328
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,460
happening everyone was so hyped to be involved with this thing that was going

1329
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:37,540
on during this time and it was it was very effective but to do it to like

1330
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:40,660
immediately do like the same sort of thing even like two months later they'd

1331
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,740
be like oh yeah like we got it here the cheers they'd be like yeah a little

1332
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:47,300
quieter then like maybe a month later so yeah okay we're doing this again all

1333
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:53,100
right same shit so I don't know like yeah yeah that's the only reason I'm not

1334
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:56,740
sure about doing a July one I mean it's not gonna have the same pipe there's

1335
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:00,740
gonna be a few people they'll be like oh you're doing one now that's cool but

1336
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:04,460
really you know I don't really want it to be I don't really care too much about

1337
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:09,020
it being like a big like oh yeah branding and everyone buys all about that

1338
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:14,100
bright shirts mostly cuz I can't be bothered to think about that I just want

1339
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,500
to make I just want to get into the habit of being able to make you gotta get

1340
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:22,700
one videos in a month I think it's that that skill is something I need yeah and

1341
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,620
I think it's important for everybody to realize that like all of that branding

1342
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:30,220
and stuff is it's not just that that's a good like marketing decision it's that

1343
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:34,620
that's what allowed Nate to do that I couldn't have done it if he didn't make

1344
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:38,100
it a big deal it had to have lots of pressure it had to be like a lot of

1345
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,420
personal responsibility on the line personally for me that wouldn't have

1346
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:44,940
worked on me but having money on the line worked right because I am a fucking

1347
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:48,660
Jew and I will not like the idea that I was gonna have to pay out a hundred and

1348
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:52,660
ten dollars because that's about how much how many bets I made yeah the idea of

1349
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,900
having to pay a hundred ten dollars because I failed to make a video every

1350
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:57,340
day was completely unacceptable you know it was funny I don't know if I

1351
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,740
mentioned this in the interview yesterday but like I had actually been

1352
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:02,780
planning on one of the things I was gonna make as part of me in math but was a

1353
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:07,300
deal with the audience where if I don't succeed at making all this I will like

1354
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,580
give the money away that I make during this month to like whatever we'll have

1355
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:14,740
like a poll like I was really considering that but then I just thought you

1356
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:18,820
know what like that is unnecessary I don't think people the problem with that

1357
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:22,060
is it would people would start holding you to like oh it has to be midnight yeah

1358
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,740
like then it would have been weird standards for stuff whereas this was

1359
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:29,700
better but yeah that was that was tossed around but yeah I don't know I

1360
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:34,460
guess there's a place for me in math was in the world but I don't know like I

1361
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:37,660
would love a give me a math of some kind I'd love like what I want from give and

1362
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:40,820
that's what me a math was was an excuse for you to just make tons of content

1363
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:44,380
fast I want to know what you're thinking I want to see you do goofy what I want

1364
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:49,340
from given is just in the same thing that I was inspired up with by me a

1365
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:54,140
math of which is a middle ground yeah between like the absolute like I made

1366
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:59,180
this in 10 seconds but it is fucking great that is give and take and the like

1367
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:02,580
this took a whole month that is hypocrite like I want that I'll be

1368
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:06,820
essentially what minuscule reviews are but like without pigeonholing in it into

1369
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:12,500
being called a minuscule review you know yeah so there you go there's your

1370
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:19,900
answer I guess next question let's see here how deep in are we we are one hour

1371
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:23,300
and 49 minutes okay let's we'll do a couple more of these and then we'll

1372
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:29,060
wrap the shit up okay how do we how we got here oh at oh at rain snow hail hey

1373
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:34,580
what's up dude asks a which member slash friend of the PCP if not already doing a

1374
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:40,020
podcast together would you like to at least try to co-host a show with co-hosting

1375
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:45,020
shows people outside the PCP outside the PCP or is that what they said what

1376
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:49,580
member friend friend oh slash member PCP okay so it'd be I think I got the

1377
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:53,700
impression he means like which other PCP member do we want to have an

1378
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,140
individual show with right so like who do you want to do things with that you're

1379
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:00,460
not already doing something did you did you has been saying that me and him

1380
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:05,340
should do something but we have no real concrete idea of what exactly concrete

1381
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:10,220
reviews review concrete there you go shows with I've got a show with monkey

1382
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:13,660
and a show with Nate and hippos the last one who I also want to show with but

1383
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:18,900
yeah it would have to be the right show like everybody else I love working with

1384
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:25,620
but like for a weekly show most these motherfuckers are horribly unreliable

1385
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:30,380
like if like Ben who was actually signed up for this episode and he did not show

1386
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:37,180
we haven't started a weekly show with Ben I just like the reason why I'm on so

1387
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:40,820
few episodes of this show is I'm really good at talking myself down from

1388
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:44,860
thinking that I'm gonna have much to say that will be useful and like I'm the

1389
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:49,620
only thing that really motivates me to like to do podcasting is if there is a

1390
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:54,620
ridiculously unnecessarily elaborate plan like which is why I'm so into doing

1391
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:58,740
commentaries with digi where the idea is that we commentary every single main

1392
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:03,580
video and we say literally whatever we want that is what gives it the challenge

1393
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:07,740
that entices me so I feel like if I was to do a podcast it would have to have a

1394
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:12,540
lofty ridiculous plan like finding the bed like a narrative or some kind yeah

1395
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:18,740
some sort of weird gimmick okay fair point and if you like shows with gimmicks

1396
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:22,660
go listen to the insufferable shows social media argument the podcast of

1397
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:26,260
Jones dot com so viewers do I actually do when they have

1398
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,140
no but I'm hoping somebody buys it and just makes it porn or something

1399
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:37,140
fucking give suggestions for some overly ambitious podcast concept that I could

1400
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:41,940
possibly be skilled in in some way hit me up with that we had we had teased the

1401
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,100
idea between ourselves are doing some sort of like debate or like idea

1402
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:48,060
discussion thing so maybe at some point we'll do something like that I think me

1403
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:51,900
and Nate are gonna end up with like a bunch of podcasts together yeah we got

1404
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:57,820
Aromango has been going really well we've talked about doing I don't know if

1405
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:01,860
we should talk about some other projects we have like several other

1406
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:06,220
brilliant idea that I think it's one of the best I've ever had so I hope that

1407
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:14,140
it we get it going at some point super secret super secret let's real quick

1408
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,180
why don't we just talk about just let's just name the ones that exist already

1409
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:20,700
just to run through real quick so there's the PCP of course there's the

1410
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,780
pod D cast with me and give which is the one piece weekly there is the pony

1411
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:29,740
cast which is Jesse and give you know my little pony every week what am I

1412
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:33,020
missing out there's insufferable social media between monkey and digi

1413
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:38,060
Aromonga sensei Aromonga sensei digi and Nate and the naru cost of the

1414
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:42,780
naru cast with mage and mage we're working on an episode to hell yeah there's

1415
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:46,860
rowdy fuckers cop killers which is Munchie and Munchie and Ben yeah there's

1416
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:51,980
the stealing your dad's as if it was easy which is me and munchie yep yep there's

1417
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:56,940
there's the the commentary is it me and DeVoo do which is once a month there's the

1418
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:00,700
homestuck thing that munchie's doing on his channel now though that's none of us are really

1419
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:05,180
it was on there but yeah that's mostly his thing there's a sigh tries to get

1420
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:11,980
monkey into because I is an honorary member right you guys all like readies an honorary member

1421
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:19,740
and uh he's he's what he's part of the uh the like the the sub PCP I have in my head

1422
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:25,740
that there's like like there's there's a secret 10 person like PCP it's like the dark pcp it's

1423
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:33,260
the dark pcp yeah it's like it's like it's like latin still sigh uh um uh who else would be in our

1424
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:38,540
night of the nega yeah i know the nega pcb well don't call me negative that's not as would be

1425
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:43,020
digi we talked about this in atlanta that like it's a fighting game and it's the pcp and then

1426
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:46,940
there's all the like the assist oh yeah they're the color swaps right the color swaps or are you

1427
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:51,660
on the summons yeah oh the summons yeah okay so sigh is an alternate skin for digi and like

1428
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:58,300
nine is an alternate skin for nate which is not an insult anymore because sigh has lost a lot of

1429
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:03,420
weight and probably weighs less than i do now so it's no it's an insult on you digi yeah we're

1430
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:08,380
insulting you digi to compare you to sigh i'm saying that it's not an insult to me because

1431
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:13,980
sigh is no longer fat sigh is even it's more of a personality thing wait well it's not insulting

1432
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:19,180
it's perfectly politically correct all i care is that i'm not compared to a fat guy that's the only

1433
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:23,580
thing that matters to me okay yeah what is it i've got the perfect the perfect podcast that needs to

1434
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:29,500
exist uh munchie and jeff something with them something with munchie and jeff being overwhelmed

1435
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:34,860
munchie would destroy his mind yes exactly exactly digi i just thought wouldn't be great in an alternate

1436
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:39,580
timeline where your friend brandon tollantino kept doing podcasts with you and he was actually

1437
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:43,500
known by your current fans because then he could be an alternate skin for hippo and the only one

1438
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:47,820
i could think of oh yeah oh yeah yeah i was actually wondering who'd be the old skit for hippo but

1439
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:55,660
um uh well i think divu and uh and lockwood skill and lockwood still would be monkey and

1440
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:02,540
i mean monkey would be a main character as well but how isn't locklin tall i don't i don't how we

1441
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:06,860
do in this this relationship okay it doesn't matter okay here's our i don't even topic are we on

1442
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:10,700
right now okay we're still talking about podcasts sharing podcast i forget what question that was uh

1443
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:15,660
doesn't matter here's our last question for the day okay benjamin whistle at benjamin whistle

1444
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:22,140
ash what do y'all think of cars what do you think of our cars but i wish i wasn't bored by them

1445
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:25,980
and whenever because like there was a moment where i was thinking about how there's like this subset

1446
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:30,460
of people who are just like oh yeah that's a 95 honda sieve bitch something or other and i'm just

1447
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:36,220
like man you know whenever i'm watching a show and there's a video game console and i and my eyes

1448
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:41,340
light up and like oh what video game console is that and i can tell based on any subtle visual cues

1449
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:49,340
and i'm like man people who are like that with cars get to be like that all day outside i'm like

1450
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:54,460
that's ridiculous how could you possibly deal with that much stimulation of intrigue also what kind

1451
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:59,100
of literally are you the like cars what else do you like pavement do you like unicycles just

1452
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:09,580
i have what i call car dyslexia any two cars that look anything alike i cannot tell them apart

1453
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:14,780
um which makes it difficult to find my own car because my i guess the the design of my car is

1454
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:20,140
very popular in like modern cars so they all look like mine sure it's very very confusing but you

1455
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:25,820
got the beeper the right that thing you don't have that problem when you only ever drive $300

1456
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:35,260
cars from the fucking 70 yeah yeah but like good old inlet g but uh g brain i mean i can't like i

1457
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:39,740
can't differentiate enough between cars to give a fuck about them but like there was a period where

1458
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:44,060
because my dad runs a dealership he also doesn't give a fuck about cars he just is good at selling

1459
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:50,540
but he hired a bunch of my friends and like you an animal somehow them starting to work with cars

1460
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:56,860
made them suddenly like all about cars like all they talk about his cars it was really really

1461
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:02,700
strange like to see a bunch of like like otaku guys suddenly become like these huge car otaku

1462
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:08,220
and like fucking always like buying forza games and like listening to initial d mega mixes and

1463
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:12,620
shit like the initial d thing is cool yeah like they just got way into cars and they

1464
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:15,260
would like talk about it all day and i'm like how can you even tell the difference between

1465
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:21,580
these fucking things my dad is sort of obsessed with cars um you know he's always he's usually

1466
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:26,220
getting like a new one and like he's like he'll always have like a nice car um at our house so

1467
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:30,380
he'll like be he'll sell the old nice one he'll buy a new nice one he wants a constant rotation

1468
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:33,980
it's like what brings him the most joy in life so that's great and like after he retires he's

1469
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:37,820
thinking of like working in it with a dealership in some way be coming like an amateur salesman

1470
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:43,020
just to make a little money um but like he tells me these stories like when he was a little boy

1471
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:47,820
i believe it was he would sit with his grandpa like on uh like the edge of the road they would

1472
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:53,580
watch cars come by and like the grandpa would quiz him like based on the headlight shape of the cars

1473
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:57,820
it'd be like what car is that and it was a game to see how quickly my dad could tell exactly what

1474
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:03,100
like model make year was the fucking car that was coming and at some point he just completely fell

1475
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:07,980
in love with cars and is just super obsessed what pisses me off is that you can be that

1476
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:13,340
and people think that's like relatively normal yeah they do same with sports like like you can

1477
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:18,780
you can know this like insane autistic level of shit about cars and people are just like

1478
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:22,460
hey it's just a car guy this is just this is socially about anime it's like oh i bet that

1479
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:27,100
guy's never gotten laid you know like those are the socially well i mean yeah that's true though

1480
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:35,420
yeah well putting that aside well that's the reason it's a self-perpetuating prophecy like

1481
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:40,620
the people who are like that with anime they think of themselves as guys who oh i'm into

1482
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:45,260
something weird you know whereas everybody needs don't have to think that you know everybody needs

1483
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:50,220
somebody who knows how to fix a car you don't need somebody who knows what fucking i'm not talking

1484
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:55,500
about people who know how to fix a car i'm talking about people who who just memorize car

1485
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,660
shit yeah that's not really much of a mechanic or anything he's mostly just an appreciator of

1486
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,660
how cars look and shit yeah most car people don't know the first fucking thing and they all think

1487
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:08,700
they do but they don't know how to fix a fucking car you know i'm a car person i've been this whole

1488
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:13,660
time it's a secret yeah the most well-guarded secret of all time tell me tell me three things

1489
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:19,340
about a car that are true tell me three you can't do it guys you can't do it a famous creator of

1490
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:30,620
the video fuck cars a car person at least just well mate uh-huh i lied just now i lied three

1491
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:34,380
times i love i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie i lie it's about it's

1492
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:40,540
about what we wish we knew that's how you get farther in life that's how you progress as a person

1493
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:47,020
i love cars i i i think they're cool i i i deeply envy people who understand them and know about them

1494
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:54,740
Like I say, I watch like regular car reviews on YouTube. I watch top gear sometimes. I look at car

1495
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:59,660
Like I look at cars that are for sale all the time and fantasize about being able to buy all the cars

1496
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:03,660
If I had a million dollars, I'd be the guy who just like goes bankrupt buying like 20 cars

1497
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:08,980
You know my my dream in life my ultimate goal in life is to someday own

1498
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:12,820
The blue viper that I owned in Gran Turismo 3 when I was a kid

1499
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:16,780
And that's what I've been working towards my whole life that goddamn Gran Turismo 3 car

1500
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:21,660
I want it. I thought you wanted a Jeep Wrangler. The Jeep Wrangler has put a stepping stone

1501
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:27,620
Add that to the wiki folks, that's Canon lore. Yeah, all right

1502
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:30,780
The Aztec that you drove in Breaking Bad

1503
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:34,340
You can do that. That's a cheap drink. Yeah, I

1504
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:38,900
Think cars is a terrible movie. Yeah

1505
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:43,380
I think that cars 3 is a step in the right direction after the

1506
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:47,900
One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I don't like it

1507
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:55,540
Toy Story 3 was better. Incidentally Jesse mentioned regular car reviews that guys like to me like the asop rock of YouTube

1508
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:01,980
Like a guy who's like so high-level that I can't even completely comprehend it and that think that might I don't know

1509
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:06,700
I've never subscribed to him. I've only seen a couple of his videos, but he's like the most legitimate like

1510
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,820
He like he writes like a real classic journalist like

1511
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:16,780
YouTube analysis videos. It's like his stuff like makes me feel weak. It makes me feel like I'm not doing enough

1512
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:23,180
Like I am not a good enough writer if this guy is out there or a good enough man because I don't have enough cars

1513
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:29,660
Cars are cool. I need to get my I need to get my oil change

1514
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,460
Should we describe what

1515
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,460
I

1516
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:39,420
Drive a drive a Honda Odyssey a gold Honda Odyssey

1517
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:46,460
Shit bus yeah, I drive a 2015 BMW X1

1518
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:52,780
Yeah, you're just helping people out when they're on the quest to rob you because all your shit's in your car

1519
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:56,140
Did you nothing's in my car? I bring it all in everywhere. It's true. It's true

1520
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:58,820
We got it protected

1521
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:05,140
Did nobody hear my my car? Yeah, I just got why you were playing that I was just confused

1522
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:20,300
Remember when John Chon was funny. I remember have we not had a remember when John Chon was funny podcast

1523
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:25,700
You should do that. He's definitely had more than enough John Chon complaining material

1524
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,860
I guess that's true. I guess that's true and others

1525
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:40,660
We have some like meta podcasts that have like slowly pieced themselves together inadvertently like so fuck movie Bob cast

1526
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:44,140
That's like five hours long, but it's never been made intentionally

1527
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:50,500
If you're if you're a PCP fan who wants an excuse to listen back to every episode and find something creative to do with it

1528
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:55,740
Snip together every time we've talked about John Chon or movie Bob or like anyone else

1529
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:59,500
We bring up all the time and just make that a podcast. That'd be cool. That'd be cool

1530
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:00,460
Yeah

1531
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:06,740
Also string together all the times at me and digi privately in the car talked about movie Bob with no microphones because it's fucking hilarious

1532
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:13,380
Yeah, it's like really the only thing like hundreds of hours banging on about the same points that he's made five times before with like no update

1533
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:15,540
I just love shit talking people. Yeah

1534
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:19,100
There's no need to hold back when you're not on fucking, you know

1535
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:23,100
Well, I'm not that I would hold back on a microphone about movie Bob anyway

1536
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:28,620
Sure sure like there's just certain people who you just get glatch on to and it's like you just want to shit on them all the time

1537
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:29,180
I know what you mean

1538
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:33,940
You know what you mean and movie Bob's a big one for especially me and DeVue because we have a lot of the same problems

1539
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,660
But just to shit on John Chon one more time speaking of

1540
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:42,420
Conciseness I feel like there's some point to be made with his ridiculously slow upload schedule. Fuck you John Chon

1541
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,620
Get your shit together be funny again

1542
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:48,940
Drive to that set. So anyway, we Bob guy

1543
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:51,980
I want I want people to bought to bug me as much as possible

1544
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:58,340
To do the game over thinker PZP lecture because I am qualified to do it

1545
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:03,140
And I think I could and it's the only thing I could do a lecture on I only want to do it

1546
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:08,260
If enough people want me to do it though. I'm not sure. Okay, if you press press just spoiler

1547
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:13,100
It will be just me and spirited and bitter no matter how hard I try not to be it's not gonna be funny

1548
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:16,180
Like well, he is fat. So it's okay. Don't worry about it

1549
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:22,980
Well, we're still talking about the cars we drives. Oh, yeah, I have a I have a funny anecdote, you know

1550
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:26,980
Uh-huh. I got the best car, which is also the worst car

1551
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:33,980
I drive around in like a I drive around in an old blue police car from the 70s or 80s just like

1552
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:39,940
Victoria, yeah, but like I don't have like insurance or like a license plate. Oh

1553
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:43,460
Wait like every

1554
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:49,100
So like I've gotten pulled over a bunch of times and now it's at the point where like

1555
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:53,100
All the cops recognize my car. Everyone knows it

1556
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:58,300
I'm the only guy I'm the only guy driving around in a fucking blue police car from the 70s

1557
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:04,300
So every I get pulled over every day and I owe a lot of money to the courts

1558
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:09,820
You gotta get some fucking go down to the day. I have to get the Tim Horton's name
