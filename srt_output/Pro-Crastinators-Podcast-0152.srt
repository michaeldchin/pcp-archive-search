1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One more time. One, two, three, bang!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That seems very wrong.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It would be even funnier if we did take the offer and did we have to shelter both?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, well that will be hilarious, but let's start.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This bang issue is going to be what finally tears this apart. We knew it was going to be something.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is this the cold open arc of the PCP?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
God, I wish it is. I hate interest. I hate them just in concept.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I just want to hit the ground fucking running.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I really like the cold open last time.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They're just great. There were positives and negatives.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There were no negatives.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you mind if I animate during this podcast?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know what? I'm going to take this time to rail against our audience

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and call out the literal cowards in the comments who were like,

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
did you guys not mean to keep the first part in?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I literally can't believe they were saying that.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fuck off. Die.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay? We're bringing you the real shit.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're bringing you the raw shit.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're toppling Nate's totalitarian regime where there's format or structure

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
or anything makes sense or means anything.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is a new era.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We clearly state in the clip that we were putting it in the beginning.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Do you think that we just forgot?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We just left in the entire intro and we didn't realize?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here's my theory.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't mind saying if it was me editing, I would have cut that out

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and been like, nah, this doesn't need to be an end.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is it. This is why. This is why.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We need an end. We need an end to Nate.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If only. There was some way to avoid Nate's crushing iron will on everyone

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
involvement in the PCP.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Only. Editors had any autonomy whatsoever in what they do.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If only. We had any power to loosen his iron grip.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm gonna start drinking bang so you can reverse that mental retardation.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I need to start chugging it by the barrel full.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey everybody. Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Today with me is Hippo Crit.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Uh, Mage.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stop. Don't do it.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a very soft coffee. I like it.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't give in.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nate's here.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's true.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't agree.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Munchies around.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can't.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You've got soft coffee. I got a soft talk.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You've never been aroused, never been aroused.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And you're playing their game.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And last but not least.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everybody.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wonderboy.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know, why would you just have...

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Dancane is here.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why don't we just have intros? I feel like we don't even need the pockets.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If we just repeat the intros over and over, that'll be our best material.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, I still want to one day do the, what's it like, algorithmically generated PCP podcast via bots.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That'll be good. That'll be good.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How would that go?

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, how would you...

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you talking about like an actual bot to do that?

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean, oh well, okay, so theoretically you could take, you could like program a bot to have like certain topics that it brings up.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And you know, it would speak in Robo voice.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Maybe we could work on that and tweak it and send more like us.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But if you just have, you know, I'm sure there's a formula you could follow.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, what if we had like a text to speech?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Like we each took our own audio for maybe like a couple of episodes, just our own audio.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Put it in like a text to speech reader and then just like read the script.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, no, no, no, we took that.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, put that into like a procedural text generator.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Generated like, you know, a bunch of shit and just read it and like took turns or something.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You know what Ben?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That sounds like it would be a great idea, Ben.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It reminds me of an episode of Star Trek that I saw.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
By the way guys, have you played the new Pokemon game?

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The new Pokemon game was a lot of fun.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's already happening.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you guys want to join the Yang gang with me?

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, it's terrible.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You know that Burger King Footlettus guy was not a bot?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just a guy with a weird voice.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But I think it would be way less go here than that.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I watched Chills all the fucking time.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm a Chills aficionado.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Listen, yeah, Burger King Footlettus is funny, but he is so much more than meets Leigh Ai.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He is a fucking true American hero.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Every video, he is so not confident about the videos he's picked.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Every single like top 10 scariest video YouTubers who have avoided calamity.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He was like two children are in the woods.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Unfortunately, I do not think this video is real, but who knows?

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Number nine.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Whoa.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, that's good.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's a good impression.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a fascinating cadence he has to his voice.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I love it.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so fun.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's so fun to say.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's a real man.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He has genuine fears and wants in life.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's one top 10.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I believe it's something like videos of people who have nearly avoided disaster.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Every single video is about people who have nearly avoided disaster.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's this dude.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's a video of this guy driving through the rain.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
His voiceover, something in effect of like, watch as the rain pours on the windshield of this tired Nebraska male.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He is driving frantically.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The road has low friction and it is hard to control.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then he just builds up this image of this poor, disheveled man trying to race home for whatever reason.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And then like, the quote unquote disaster that he nearly avoids is nothing.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It just is the entirety of the video, which is the disaster.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm going to be a little pro audience here because I haven't heard of this.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I know.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So clarify, so this is a YouTuber who people thought was like a voice bot?

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Like an algorithmic voice bot?

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's just a YouTuber has a very, very, very interesting voice.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A very strange voice.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And his name is Chills, did you say Chills?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Chills, Chills.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's a rapper.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's a rapper.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, no, man.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I had to finish this fucking video.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I thought you were finished.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, no, no, no, no.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So he's building up the picture of this guy frantically driving through the rain in his typical Chills fashion.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then once he gets to the end and supposedly something dangerous was supposed to be witnessed,

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we were supposed to see something that was supposed to lead to his doom, which didn't happen.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He just says that he threw in this video.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He's such an affinity for firefighters and he wants to give a shout out to all the medical drivers of America

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
who have to drive through the dense rains.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Was this guy a medical driver in the video?

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know, maybe.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The point is, is that he just loves, he just loves like EMT members.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's bad conveyance.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He just loves people in ambulances so much.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He wanted to be one of them as a kid.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You get really sensitive.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You get really sensitive.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I appreciate the sentiment.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You get him.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You really feel more connected to Chills.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When I was a kid, I wanted to work at a lemonade stand.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Did you do it?

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's the perfect time to do that.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I just couldn't hack it.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The state didn't just give Ben his lemonade stand.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What was he supposed to do about that?

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What was I supposed to do about that?

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A crew capital and invest in a small business?

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, it doesn't sound realistic.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It just doesn't sound like a thing people do.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Speaking of accruing mass sums of capital.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, no, no.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Mage was going to speak.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Since we're talking about YouTubers with funny voices or shticks or whatever.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is one YouTuber I really like.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He on purpose talks very, very slowly in a monotone and people give him shit for it.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But as if they don't realize that he's doing it on purpose and it's so funny to me that they...

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Who?

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's the kind of concept?

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Name names.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The YouTube is Daft Pina, like Daft Punk, but Daft Pina.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's a good boy. He's a good person.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I talked to him.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I used to talk to him.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not like I do it daily.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is he a possible political connection that can help me in my quest?

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Could he be of use to the Yang Gang?

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's all we need to know.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Could he be of use to us?

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, he already has over 100k subscribers.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, there you go.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's get him on here.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's a straight up social media influencer, right?

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not sure if he would want us as his associates.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, don't say that.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know. I'm not proud of you guys.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's the meanest thing anyone's ever said.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, he's leaving.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if he doesn't want to associate.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I understand. I get it.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're not proud of us.

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's a step forward.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a step way forward.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's a leap.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't believe it.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Man, I'm proud of you.

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why do you need to rectify this?

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, whenever we're done reeling from this revelation...

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Actually, is anybody proud of the PCP?

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have to wonder.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because Mage isn't proud of it.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Jesse hadn't even told his friends he had a podcast for three years.

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And Tom got banned from Mastodon because of his association with us.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I am still...

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That was pretty crazy.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't understand what that was about.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Did you hear what happened?

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Basically, Tom got banned from this social media platform called Mastodon.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Not quite. From a group on the platform, not the whole thing.

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Right. Well, because Mastodon exists in instances.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like Discord?

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, kind of like Discord, except it's not...

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's like random what instance you're in, I guess.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know.

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was confused about it when he...

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Like an MMO server?

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought it was like a Twitter-esque sort of thing.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is. It functions like Twitter, but it is an instanced site.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, there's like different mods that moderate like 100 person groups of it.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And the mod of his instance was not happy with the things he was tweeting.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's like Discord?

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If the actual texting and messaging of Discord was like Twitter,

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but the Discord servers, you had a new account for each one of them.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, you didn't have one account with a ton of servers.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It was just for each server you were in.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That was a new account that you had.

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And that account that he had in that server was deleted.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, okay.

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, people should...

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We should link this in the show notes for the specific tweet.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And it was because of us.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, it was a number of things.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
First of all, it happened because he had made a tweet talking about how...

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You mean a mastodon?

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A mastodon, sure.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, the thing is that everything he posts on mastodon is just a tweet.

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He just has a program that posts the same thing everywhere.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, it was a tweet.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But he had tweeted out that, like in America,

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
their handling of Michael Jackson was this new documentary that is of questionable veracity.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Whereas in Japan, they are still celebrating Michael Jackson

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
by having a huge reference to him in the New Devil May Cry game,

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
which he had posted a screencap of.

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The moderator claimed that he was being insensitive to victims.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That Tom was?

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, that Tom was being insensitive to victims.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, I hated that because, like...

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean, the whole idea of...

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Tom is defending the only victim who's fucking in the case!

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not even like Tom hates the victims,

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
because Tom doesn't believe that there are victims.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It would be very different if, like, fuck the people that Michael Jackson,

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I believe, did rape or whatever.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But he doesn't believe that Michael Jackson did that.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
First of all, Tom is not making a political stance with that comment.

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He is making an observation on the different, you know,

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
like, reaction to the character of Michael Jackson by different populaces.

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So he is not making a stance.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He's making a joke, I mean, obviously.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I suppose the most negative interpretation of that, you could say, is,

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
oh, look at him highlighting.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He's choosing to highlight Japan's, I don't know, less interested,

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
or perhaps skeptical reaction to accusations made.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Therefore, evil, I don't know, right wing...

265
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe in their eyes, Tom is like the Holocaust denier of the Michael Jackson variety.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, you got to understand the way that things are right now,

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
because this new Michael Jackson documentary came out,

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and very much so, it's created, like, a whole new wave of people who are like,

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
oh, he was a monster.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I think they probably did this to capitalize on the R. Kelly thing,

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
because R. Kelly had a big documentary come out that made everybody realize

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
he was way worse than they first thought.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I have mostly heard people...

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, I kind of...

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This happens to me a lot.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you really hear about something by way of the backlash against it?

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's almost exclusively how I hear about anything.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, and I didn't know about this documentary until I heard people grumbling

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that people are unfair to Michael Jackson, there's no real evidence against him.

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right.

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And then I realized, like, oh, I guess the documentary just came out,

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
talking about what he's a bad man.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, because a lot of people believe that documentary,

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that is probably the more, like, majority cultural-tied view of the situation.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sure that this mod just straight-up believes it.

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It doesn't even remotely think about the idea that somebody would think that it was just untrue.

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
To him, it's like Holocaust denial.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So, yeah, so they went to...

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They already gave him a warning for that tweet.

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then they found out about a tweet that he had done just promoting the latest episode of PCP,

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the podcast.

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And I guess this mod actually went and listened to PCP.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Seemed like it, yeah.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And he said that there were a lot of...

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What was it, homophobic and ableist slurs?

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I believe so, yeah.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Funny.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Funny.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It had to be said.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You know, I mean, we fucking had the N-word dropped a bunch on recent episodes.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You'd think it would be for that.

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, I mean, we all just, like, out of pocket say retarded constantly.

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I guess that's true.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Maybe we should examine that.

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't even think it was that Tom said it.

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He just said that those things were said on the podcast that Tom associates with.

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I believe that's correct, yeah.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Implying Tom talks on the PCP.

309
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You know, and Tom was complicit by being on the episode, I suppose.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, that's not fair.

311
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not fair.

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Just because you're in the same platform doesn't mean that you stand by the same...

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like, I mean, like, you and Ben.

314
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know, like, three episodes.

315
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You've been disagreeing.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, Mange, I'm purely playing devil's advocate.

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm not.

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Like, for example, I think if you get like a...

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like, sorry, on MSNBC, which is like, they say it's liberal or whatever,

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
if you bring on like a conservative to like argue with him and you're a host,

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
then like, even though you're literally arguing against his point,

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
one could still make the argument that you're choosing to highlight him

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and so you're like...

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're arguing.

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't think so.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Very stupid.

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If we were...

328
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's not stupid.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't think it's stupid.

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Imagine we were a, like, fucking, I don't know, white supremacist podcast

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and you posted...

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
A just caller?

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Of course not, Ben.

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Of course not.

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And you posted a link to us.

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I mean, that would be spreading our propaganda

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and if someone was against that and doesn't think it should be spread,

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
like, fuck you, get off my platform, that makes sense.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, I mean, I think that's essentially what these mod thought was going on.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ben, can you agree, though, that that is extremely cowardly

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
for this person to say that like, oh, he doesn't want us to spread our ideas,

342
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but like, whether or not ideas are good or bad should be able to stand on their own.

343
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Like, it's up to everybody to determine if what they're listening to is good or bad.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You know, I struggle with this.

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I struggle with this a lot, because like, on the one hand,

346
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I do believe people should be able to say whatever they believe and think what they think.

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And, but what if an idea gets people hurt just by its very spread?

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And what if it's dangerous?

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then we need to learn lessons from it.

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, I mean, so like, I've heard discussions about this.

351
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
One example is like, let's just say, like, the knowledge of how to create a virus

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that would wipe out humanity.

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, I think most people would agree.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's reasonable to suppress that particular piece of information,

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
because it's purely, you know, would be purely destructive

356
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and no good would come from its existence or people's awareness.

357
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So, okay, so if you accept that, so now there is literally some information

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that just should be basically banned and not accessible.

359
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So where, then we have to discuss where the line needs to be drawn.

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Maybe, you know, only things that are directly like that should be straight up removed.

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But like, in the wake of all the New Zealand shit, they've blocked 4chan and 8chan access in the whole country.

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think specifically, I don't think it was the country, I think it was the ISPs,

363
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the private corporate interests who chose to, and the thing is we can't stop them.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let me make a cut and dry sort of theoretical kind of a thought experiment, I guess.

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If we all agreed that an idea spread harm and hurt people by its very spread

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and like by people's very belief in it, like just by talking about it,

367
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it would result in bad things and people being hurt unfairly.

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Would we agree that we should stop the spread of it and not let people advocate it and say it?

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You know, there's something to be said for the idea of like,

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
what do they say, sunlight's the best disinfectant.

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So I wouldn't even necessarily say every time that it's best to like, surprise that kind of information.

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want personally all the information that exists.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I want to be on the same playing field as everybody else.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want anybody to have information that I have no access to.

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My dude, New Zealand is straight up criminalized having the manifesto from the New Zealand shooter.

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a crime to have manifesto.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's fucking ridiculous.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That is fucking insanity.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We can learn a lot from this manifesto that's retarded.

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, like for example, all the ways that he's, you know, wrong and I disagree with his conclusions.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Exactly.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But not everyone's gonna read, just mathematically, not everyone's gonna read that manifesto and think wrong.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You know what I mean?

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, okay, that's a good question.

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And it comes down to...

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No, no, I don't like this because like what you guys are teetering on is like policing of opinions.

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, that's exactly what it's teetering on.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, but like who decides what's good and what's bad, you know?

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Like imagine now like a lot of people are saying like, you know, like these opinions are bad,

390
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
therefore we have to silence these people.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But like they might be wrong, you know?

392
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, these are the sort of argument that comes up.

393
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Like just for one example, if you've got like, you know, super right wing, like, excuse me,

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
sorry, something about that.

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Like religious people, like for example, some of those people might not accept the fact that like,

396
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
for example, transgenderism is real.

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And so, okay, that's their opinion.

398
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And now, but you could certainly see why some people would say that this opinion is harmful and toxic.

399
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah.

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So you just end up in a situation where those people...

401
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I personally think the best course of action is to have these people and debate them

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and then like point out all the ways they're wrong.

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, no, no, listen, you're not going to change their minds because their minds are already made.

404
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're debating them to change the minds of the people who are listening.

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You allow people to decide themselves what's right and wrong.

406
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You don't police them.

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You don't force them to think the right way.

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't agree with forcing people to think of one way or another.

409
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think that that is a very optimistic way to look at things.

410
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, I think that is the pessimistic way to look at it.

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Wait, let me finish, let me finish.

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think that's optimistic because I think that's assuming people are creatures of rationality

413
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and that when two ideas clash in the public free exchange that like the better one will win out

414
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and I don't think that's true necessarily.

415
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't think this is the best course of action, but I prefer this to policing thoughts

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
because I don't want people telling me what to think or what to make of this.

417
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't want people to tell me that.

418
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
To be fair, mage, isn't that you simply prioritizing freedom

419
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
at potentially the expense of harm or safety, which I don't even disagree with.

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm just saying that you're using your preferences there to dictate.

421
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You just said you don't necessarily think it's the best course of action.

422
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The reason that this freedom is so necessary is that nobody can determine what is the best for humanity.

423
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
For all we know, it could be possible that leaving anyone outside of my particular religion,

424
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
whatever that may be, alive, will damn me to hell.

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's possible.

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Who's to say that murdering everyone outside of my religion is not in fact the best way forward

427
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
for a humanity of whoever's left afterwards?

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We have no way of knowing that.

429
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There's no objective standard of which ideas are right necessarily.

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We do have to decide that.

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Harmony is decided by society as time goes.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's shifting. There's not a constant agreement.

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's why I want all the info, because it's always going to be changing.

434
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If we said that this piece of information absolutely needs to be unlocked down,

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
For how long? From whom?

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is this information going to be handed down?

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are we going to form a fucking Templar society to protect this knowledge for the next 2,000 years?

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The info is going to get out there.

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I want to apologize. I'm going to do it, guys.

440
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to say the N-word.

441
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm going to Godwin's Law this conversation.

442
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The N-word is Nazi.

443
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I'm going to say that is that attitude not the sort of thing that leads to the rise?

444
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You fucking nigger.

445
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Shut up.

446
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
God, we got to stop. I don't like it.

447
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't fucking like.

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh yeah, we're that podcast that says the N-word.

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't want to be that podcast.

450
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What about being the podcast that doesn't accept that some words,

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
regardless of context, are always inappropriate?

452
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I do want to be that podcast, because every podcast should be that podcast.

453
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm not saying that this is a particularly tactful use just now, but you know.

454
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Everybody laughed.

455
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's what matters.

456
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I did. You defied my expectations, and you got me to laugh.

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You got me the sensible juggles.

458
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But anyway, the point is, is that kind of thinking not the thing,

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
not the sort of thinking that leads to the rise of fascism, etc.

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Because it's like, oh, who knows? Who's to say what's wrong?

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, isn't your kind of thinking leading to that sort of thing?

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because you're policing people like, my way is the right way,

463
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and everyone who's wrong is wrong, therefore they should be eliminated.

464
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The, the, I, well, hold on.

465
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Don't put this on me. I'm just asking questions.

466
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm just asking questions.

467
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm also asking questions.

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Alright, well my questions are better than your questions.

469
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There will be no answer found here today.

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I really didn't want politics to come in yet again.

471
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But like, but like, in my heart of hearts,

472
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I know that it's not necessarily a bad thing to talk about politics.

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I just never have anything to say of worth.

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Same.

475
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Because I...

476
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What do you mean? You're saying shit.

477
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We're having a debate.

478
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We're having an actual debate.

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This isn't so much about politics as opinions and the freedom of opinions.

480
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's not as political as hashtag yangang, exactly.

481
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Indeed, indeed.

482
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But it's ideological.

483
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What was I trying to say?

484
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm making politics. I don't care.

485
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm not American. I don't care for politics.

486
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay, but we're not there.

487
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I want to believe that purple is the best color

488
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and no one can tell me otherwise.

489
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You can't control the flow of conversation.

490
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, you're trying to.

491
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's why I didn't butt in either.

492
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You just got to let people talk about politics

493
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
if they want to talk about politics.

494
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Okay, we're going back to...

495
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Skip the video, maybe.

496
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's not go back.

497
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's fucking dig into this.

498
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I want to go back to opinions.

499
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't think it'll just be...

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We won't...

501
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We already know what the issue is.

502
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I want to expand.

503
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I want to expand.

504
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, Mage, expand.

505
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The reason I hold this opinion is not necessarily

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
because I think it's the best way forward.

507
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't think it's possible to make people...

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
All the people just follow rules all the time

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and not expect rebellion.

510
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, I think within the freedom of being able to choose your own opinions,

511
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
maybe Darwin's Law will come into play

512
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and all the stupid people will die out.

513
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't know.

514
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, here's the question.

515
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Say you're a mod.

516
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I just want truth to be out there, not suppressed

517
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because a lot of the time, truth is suppressed

518
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
in favor of...

519
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What's best for the people isn't necessarily the truth,

520
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is a popular opinion.

521
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And I don't like that.

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I want to know the truth

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and I want to base my opinions on the available truth.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I can't tell what the truth is

525
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
without knowing all sides of the story.

526
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And therefore, I want to know all sides of the story

527
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
so I can find the truth myself

528
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and then decide on my own what I want to believe.

529
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, question.

530
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What if someone's lying?

531
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What if someone's going on the internet

532
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
or wherever going on podcasts?

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Of course, of course.

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What if they're going and they're spreading lies

535
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and misinformation?

536
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, and it's up to each individual person

537
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
to see if, you know, it leads to truth.

538
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Right there, Ben.

539
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're assigning malice to that,

540
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but I mean, I'm sure you would agree that...

541
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not assigning that.

542
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
They could be doing it by accident.

543
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, okay.

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But to lie by accident is not actually a lie.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's just a mistake.

546
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I didn't say lie.

547
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, I did say lying,

548
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but I also said spreading and misinformation.

549
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It happens.

550
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It happens a lot.

551
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
As I said, it happens a lot,

552
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
but there's a chaotic element in this.

553
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's not ideal.

554
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's not perfect.

555
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It doesn't always give the best results.

556
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I know that, but I prefer this

557
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
to being told what to think.

558
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't like the whole militant idea of, like,

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
someone decides what's best for you.

560
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Therefore, it's best for you.

561
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Don't question it.

562
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Just follow orders.

563
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Be a robot.

564
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Live your life the way everyone tells you to.

565
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't like it.

566
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well...

567
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think we've literally covered everything we can cover.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I want to say one more thing.

569
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't think we've risen to the level of talking about,

570
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
like, should we put a legal ban on saying certain things,

571
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
although I guess we could ask that question.

572
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I mean, we're talking about a mod on Mastodon.

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We're talking about an individual

574
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that is charged with moderating a community.

575
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
In 1984, the story wasn't so much.

576
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It wasn't really a story about how the state imposed control

577
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
of everyone.

578
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It was about how the people rose up and demanded

579
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
that they be policed and that their speech be controlled,

580
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and it was the people themselves who did it to each other,

581
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
as opposed to, like, the government doing it.

582
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So, you know, this is a danger from just within society.

583
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We've got corporations that do it now,

584
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and they're going beyond the government's control,

585
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
which doesn't reach this far, at least in America.

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes.

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I mean, in 1984, it was...

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I mean, the people did it to each other,

589
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
but the government enforced...

590
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know.

591
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I guess it's sort of chicken and egg thing about,

592
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
like, did the government impose this on the people

593
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
in order to do the people want this,

594
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and the government took advantage of that public desire

595
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
or whatever.

596
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I mean...

597
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't know how to...

598
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Stop talking now.

599
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let's move on.

600
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let's move on to something else.

601
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Fair.

602
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hey.

603
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
No, you've done enough.

604
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You've done enough to yabber in.

605
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay. Fair.

606
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I got a thing to talk about.

607
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I've been a bit by the animation bug,

608
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
you know, that I did animation at uni,

609
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and then I just stopped.

610
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I made my three films, and then I just sort of didn't do that,

611
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and I went to YouTube and I made video game reviews,

612
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
like a fucking idiot.

613
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What a disaster.

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, but recently, you know,

615
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
while animating the finale of my webcomic,

616
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I was like, you know, animating's good,

617
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and I like the planning,

618
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I like the animatics and the storyboarding

619
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and all that stuff.

620
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And so, in rapid succession,

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
there's like two MAPs, multi-animator projects,

622
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
unfortunate acronym, but, you know, there we are.

623
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, Miss Anthropony, please come back.

624
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes, exactly.

625
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, like, I'm...

626
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I fucking love that guy.

627
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Miss Anthropony, if you're in the comments,

628
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
let us know you're there.

629
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, and if we can see you at BronyCon.

630
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And see you at BronyCon, yes.

631
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh, for sure.

632
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah.

633
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm serious, I want to fucking...

634
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Ben's gonna get bullied by Miss Anthropony at BronyCon.

635
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He's gonna kick the dick.

636
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't think so.

637
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think we've gone past that.

638
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I think we can have a meeting of the minds.

639
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm not even kidding.

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm not even joking.

641
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I think it would be really fun to, like,

642
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
fucking shake hands with Miss Anthropony.

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You should take a ceremonial picture of

644
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
both of you kicking each other in the dick simultaneously.

645
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Exactly.

646
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That would be iconic.

647
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That would be great.

648
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That would be great.

649
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But, yeah, like, I've been...

650
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I signed up for a Homestuck MAP,

651
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and I'm animating, like, two scenes,

652
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and it's just going really well,

653
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and I'm liking it.

654
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And then I'm still, like,

655
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
subbed to Crown Prince, the wolf lady.

656
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yep.

657
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The wolf lady from the thing.

658
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
She had an MAP.

659
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is she a horse lady?

660
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
No, she's always been a wolf.

661
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Wait, no, she's a horse.

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
She had a horse, but, yeah, you're right.

663
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
She's more of a wolf.

664
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, she did.

665
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
She's more of a wolf.

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
She's more of a wolf.

667
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Deep Lore.

668
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But, yeah.

669
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And she had one which is, like, a really short one,

670
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
with a much more sensible deadline.

671
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The Homestuck one is, like, for 413.

672
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's, like, a big, epic 10-year anniversary

673
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
of the beginning Homestuck.

674
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, catch me one week from then.

675
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
420, my dude, if you know what I'm saying.

676
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey.

677
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Speaking of which, let me check the calendar.

678
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So, yeah, animation's cool, and I really like

679
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that I'm getting back into a craft

680
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
that I've sort of given, like, forgotten about.

681
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's really cool.

682
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah, that's good.

683
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I feel strong and powerful.

684
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's really cool.

685
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I mean, it was probably a year ago you made,

686
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
what was it, Descend, Estesend, or whatever it is?

687
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, that was barely an animation.

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That was just sort of, like, moving drawings around

689
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
in Adobe Premiere.

690
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Like, squiggly lines going on and what not.

691
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It was awesome, though.

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It was, yeah.

693
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
For anyone, Estesend is a RFCK thing

694
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
that is on, it's on the Hippocrite channel, right?

695
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's on Given Fortress 2.

696
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Right, it's on Given Fortress 2.

697
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's also clipped on the RFCK Twitch.

698
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Indeed.

699
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, Twitch.tv slash Rowdy Frickers cop killers.

700
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What was it like to get back into it, Hippo?

701
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Did you, was there any period of, like,

702
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
oh, what the fuck is a Toon Studio or whatever I would do?

703
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The beginning was like, I wanted to make an animation

704
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for the end of Balejap.

705
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And so I was going, like, okay, I did this in uni

706
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and pre-production is the key.

707
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If you pre-produce, you know, properly,

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
then everything falls into place very easily

709
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and then animation is simply, you know, busy work

710
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
rather than brain work and you can just get through it.

711
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah.

712
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And by, you know, looking at, like, calendar dates

713
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and thinking about how fast I could make certain scenes

714
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and going through the animatic and the storyboard

715
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and it was just sort of, I just sort of fell right back into it.

716
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I really enjoyed myself making this come together

717
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and all the little gifts that I was making

718
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to, like, show various discourse that are animation-based

719
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and just like, hey, guys, look at this.

720
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's cool.

721
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm good at art

722
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and it's great.

723
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And, you know, my favorite thing about animation

724
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
is that you don't need to be good at drawing to do it.

725
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The whole point is that any one drawing stays on screen.

726
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Any one drawing stays on screen for such a small time

727
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that it's okay to be kind of bad at drawing,

728
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which is why I got into it in the first place.

729
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Time, let me gripe about people that post, like,

730
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
smear frames from animation

731
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and are like, haha, look how bad this looks.

732
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, dumb.

733
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And it's like posting a frame is stupid.

734
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I like that really wide one of Superman

735
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that doesn't prove anything

736
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that one frame in an animation is, like, weird-looking.

737
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Are you familiar with that one?

738
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's Superman, like, moving sideways into the frame,

739
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but, like, in this one moment,

740
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
he's stretched across, like, the entire canvas of the screen.

741
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I have not seen that,

742
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but have you seen the one of the cheerleaders and Kim Possible?

743
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No, no, I haven't.

744
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There's one of, like, all of them sort of in the group,

745
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
like, move down.

746
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Like, they squat down really fast before I jump or something.

747
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And so, like, all of their faces are, like, stretched

748
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and, like, stretched.

749
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Their entire face is, like, stretched down,

750
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
like, the entire length of their bodies.

751
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Do people actually laugh at that?

752
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Or do, like...

753
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I think at some point, some people did.

754
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I mean, okay, look at this.

755
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
This isn't the one I was thinking of.

756
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Check this out.

757
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But look at just...

758
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This is one of the many Superman smear frames.

759
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I think you'll appreciate it.

760
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay, it's fucking loading.

761
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
All of the references I've seen to this

762
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
just seem to be, like, haha, well, that's crazy.

763
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It looks like that in-between animation.

764
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Not that it's necessarily, like, bad.

765
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I don't think anyone thinks it's bad.

766
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I've seen people post it about, like, anime.

767
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Like, Naruto.

768
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well, it's funny you say that.

769
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I see a lot of people deliberately celebrating smear frames

770
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
in the Sakuga community.

771
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Like, it used to be...

772
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
There was a huge backlash against the fact

773
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that people would always, like, shout bad animation

774
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
at, like, uh, Shonen stuff.

775
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And, like, when there'd just be, like, a character

776
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
who looks off, like, in the background

777
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and people would highlight it and be, like,

778
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this looks terrible.

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Though, personally, it's kind of funny because

780
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
while I appreciate why, like, it's annoying to people

781
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
that that kind of stuff gets brought up

782
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and called bad animation, you know?

783
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Nonetheless, it's not like it's impossible

784
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to not have that happen.

785
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But, like...

786
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's not a... No, but it's...

787
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But with smear frames, those are obviously there

788
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
on purpose, like, they're a part of the animation.

789
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They're meant to be seen in motion.

790
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
They look fucking hilarious and great, though.

791
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I mean, this is a technique.

792
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is an animation technique.

793
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I mean, yeah, it's literally to make up for the fact

794
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
that you can only animate so many frames per second.

795
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So fucking wide.

796
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, wait, okay, I found the one.

797
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If animation was, like, 120 frames per second,

798
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you would draw each one of those.

799
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Because you literally can't.

800
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's the best one, yeah.

801
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's so...

802
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What amuses me is the face he makes.

803
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's like, it reminds me of that one anime face.

804
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That one actually looks like he's just really wide

805
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and rectangular, making a face.

806
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He looks like Balrog from Cave Story.

807
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, yes.

808
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well, I was thinking the TV man from Dead Leaves,

809
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
but that is pretty similar to Balrog.

810
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Did you... I watched that anime at your recommendation

811
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
just the other day, and it is very, very much...

812
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
He's like a very, very munchie-core.

813
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
...get an ai-kai face. Hold on, I'm gonna post this.

814
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's very, very munchie-core. I love this face.

815
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It seemed like it. It seemed like it.

816
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't know, are you down with, like, the dick jokes

817
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and the dick humor too much, though, Munchie?

818
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You seem like you would be into that.

819
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Why would Munchie not be into dicks?

820
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

821
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because he hates sex.

822
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He doesn't want to think about the existence of the penile.

823
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Munchie draws dicks all the time.

824
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That is a gross misinterpretation of my hatred for sex.

825
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But doesn't it, like, fuck, and, like, there is a baby,

826
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and that's gross, that's sex?

827
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's really cool when people fucking movies.

828
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What, am I stupid? Am I brain dead?

829
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That thing is not?

830
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't know.

831
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's really fucking cool. It's cathartic.

832
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's like seeing a dude get...

833
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Okay, I think of sex in movies the same way as getting,

834
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
like, someone's head blown off in a movie,

835
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and they're fucking gore splatters across the window.

836
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's exactly what I'm like, oh!

837
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
He screams when he sees it.

838
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah.

839
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But in a cool way.

840
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, same. I agree.

841
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I kind of lost the plot here.

842
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But I really think it's really cool that you're trying to get back

843
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
into something that you've sort of thrown to the wayside

844
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
in the pursuit of more...

845
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Gold.

846
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You know.

847
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Terrible.

848
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Interesting aspirations.

849
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, yeah.

850
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I mean, like, I never really meant to throw it to the wayside,

851
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but my overwhelming feeling coming out of animation college

852
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
was this is really depressing and difficult,

853
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and so many people try so hard,

854
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and all they end up doing is, like, advertisements,

855
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and they never...

856
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
When they're 45, they finally get enough money to make a short film,

857
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and I'm like, Jesus Christ, no, end.

858
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I don't want to do that.

859
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, like, as a career prospect,

860
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
they didn't seem like the best thing to go for

861
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
because of the way I approached animation.

862
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I felt more fun, you know, doing silly little small things

863
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that weren't, like, you couldn't really sell the stuff I do that well.

864
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I mean, maybe you could, but, like...

865
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

866
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And then I became a writer, and now that's my job,

867
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and now animation can become a hobby again, which is great.

868
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

869
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah, that's kind of...

870
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
There's probably some kind of bell curve or a bounce to be found there,

871
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and it kind of makes me wonder if, like, for your average,

872
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
like, non-career established with, like, a large income or following

873
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
or anything, for a person like that,

874
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I wonder if it makes sense to, like, have a day job of whatever kind

875
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and then to make their passion project be something they can spend years on

876
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
if they want to, and then to, you know, make it as good as they can.

877
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I mean, that's not a particularly weird, you know, set of circumstances.

878
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I mean, that's literally what I've been doing for years, so, you know.

879
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I think there's a lot of value to that, actually.

880
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I think there's a lot of value to having that sort of normal life,

881
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
you know, out in the world doing maybe a nine-to-five

882
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
or even just whatever other...

883
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's why...

884
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
...mini-label job you have.

885
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And then, you know, come home and unwind.

886
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I mean, I've been changed in my approach lately,

887
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but, like, that's why the six-month-long for a video sort of things

888
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
were, you know, taken so long.

889
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What's interesting about, like, working, you know,

890
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
just not having a job that you go to wake up, honey, toast, please,

891
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
thank you, kiss, goodbye, instead of having something like that

892
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
where you can just come home at the end of the day and be like,

893
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
well, I'm off from work, and then maybe you can turn on the telly

894
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
or maybe you can turn on, you know, your canvas

895
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and give out your praying bushes or something,

896
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you know, you have free time that is clearly yours

897
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
as opposed to that when you're doing what we do

898
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and just every waking moment from the moment you wake up

899
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
to the moment you go to bed, you could theoretically be doing work.

900
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's the life of an entrepreneur in one way or another.

901
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There's a lot of benefits to it.

902
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There's a lot of mental negatives to it, I feel.

903
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That's fair.

904
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's not for everybody.

905
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I think that's for sure.

906
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I greatly...

907
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I almost value it.

908
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think I might have pushed it away too much, like, out of sight, out of mind

909
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
in my youth, and I've been really considered the idea

910
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
of having a...

911
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Especially what Hippo is describing

912
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
of sort of like animation being like a busy work sort of thing,

913
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
just having a job that is sort of menial tasks,

914
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I kind of made it, in my mind, decided,

915
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
oh, I'm not going to do that.

916
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That's stupid.

917
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I wouldn't do that.

918
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I didn't even consider it for a while.

919
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But more and more, as I grow maybe a month or two older, I think,

920
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
maybe that's actually a good idea.

921
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Maybe I actually want to do that.

922
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Maybe I actually want to have dedicated work time,

923
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
where I can spend doing something that isn't necessarily creative pursuits.

924
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And then when I get home, I'll just have that time to myself

925
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
when I can do what I please.

926
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I resent.

927
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Listen, I understand the idea that having a regular 9-5

928
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
provides structure in your life and is maybe good in a pragmatic sense.

929
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But I hate...

930
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I can't stand the idea that I am laboring with the goal

931
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
of making my boss money,

932
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
which is the purpose of labor under capitalism.

933
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Well, I mean, you're making Patreon money with your Patreon.

934
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Are you also upset about that?

935
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't think you understood what I just said.

936
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I didn't say not...

937
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They're your boss, basically.

938
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You fool.

939
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, but I'm not working to make money for them.

940
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I don't understand. Aren't you, though?

941
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You are making money.

942
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No, of course not.

943
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
How?

944
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Are you having a stroke?

945
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I mean, you need money to live.

946
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Make money for them.

947
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Make money for them.

948
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And when you have a job, you labor so that the person employing you

949
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
generates wealth for themselves.

950
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I mean, it's called a job,

951
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and you agree to do the job to get paid,

952
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and the reason you have the job

953
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
is because you can provide value to your employer.

954
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's right.

955
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And I don't want to provide value to an employer.

956
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You...

957
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Nate, you got lost.

958
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You were talking about the fact that Patreon takes a cut of your earnings.

959
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah.

960
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That's correct.

961
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But that doesn't necessarily contradict what Ben was saying.

962
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't think that's what Nate was talking about,

963
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but that does annoy me.

964
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That does annoy me.

965
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I mean, there's the patrons as well, I suppose.

966
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

967
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm not making money for my patrons by working for their money.

968
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's not what's happening.

969
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Isn't that exactly what you're doing?

970
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you insane?

971
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
What are you talking about?

972
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Wait, wait, wait.

973
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Sorry, you said making money for them.

974
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yes.

975
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay, not money, but you are providing value,

976
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
so it's not money.

977
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Okay, but Ben's point is,

978
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
is simply that if he works for a boss in a regular job...

979
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Ben just got some issue with money, I guess.

980
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Shut up.

981
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
What did you say it?

982
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
No, you fucking idiot.

983
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If Ben is working at a regular job,

984
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
then that means that his boss is making money off of him,

985
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and he does not want that.

986
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's what he's trying to say.

987
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's correct.

988
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
He does not want his effort to make money for other people.

989
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And you resent the idea of other people having a boss.

990
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No.

991
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Why are you putting fucking words in my mouth?

992
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Listen, I said this in the comments in the last video.

993
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Someone was like,

994
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Ben, something, something, something.

995
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This must be why you resent people with corporate jobs.

996
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And I said,

997
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't resent people with corporate jobs.

998
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I get it.

999
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You gotta do what you gotta do.

1000
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Nothing wrong with making a living.

1001
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But I resent the jobs themselves.

1002
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Jobs are, I mean, not always, but, you know, a lot of,

1003
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I mean, jobs exist to generate value for the employer and,

1004
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
you know,

1005
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
They also exist to, like, make the world happen.

1006
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't know.

1007
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't think they do under capitalism.

1008
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't want to get into this, dude.

1009
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I will just get mad.

1010
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You are so retarded, Ben.

1011
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You're the dumbest person on the planet.

1012
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This pisses me off.

1013
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I would say,

1014
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
well, explain, Nate, why you gotta back that up.

1015
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I don't want to get in.

1016
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Look, just your whole conception about the exploitation of the worker

1017
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
who agrees to do the job.

1018
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh, no.

1019
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's so sad they're being abused by agreeing to take the job

1020
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
that their employer beneficially gives to them to do

1021
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
what a sad Satan fares.

1022
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm going to take the high road and not get mad,

1023
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
even though you are completely misquoting me

1024
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and putting words in my mouth that I didn't say.

1025
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I love you.

1026
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I love you.

1027
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
There you go.

1028
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Aw.

1029
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You fucker.

1030
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That reminds me a very different topic quickly.

1031
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The video that you guys recently released,

1032
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I just realized at the very end,

1033
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you guys lay in one bed, marriage confirmed.

1034
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah.

1035
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Indeed.

1036
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
True.

1037
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This was never in doubt.

1038
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And as with every marriage,

1039
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
there is one intellectual superior and one intellectual inferior.

1040
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I would agree.

1041
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And I think we've made our cases well here.

1042
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I think we know who's who, wink, wink.

1043
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Indeed.

1044
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Audience will understand my point.

1045
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
They will understand the truth.

1046
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So is the ending of the T-Bap not an angry beavers reference?

1047
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I have no idea what you meant when you said that.

1048
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It wasn't intended.

1049
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
There's this episode of angry beavers where the two of them

1050
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
wake up after experiencing some kind of dream within a dream

1051
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
kind of thing and I think one of them slaps the other

1052
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and then they keep waking up.

1053
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Or no, it was a time travel thing.

1054
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't fucking know.

1055
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No, he kept slapping him into last Tuesday.

1056
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's what it was.

1057
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He kept slapping him so hard that he would go back in time

1058
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
or something like that.

1059
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I mean, it sounds hilarious, but it was not intended to be.

1060
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I watched angry beavers and I don't remember that.

1061
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This is all I remember from angry beavers.

1062
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I saw like 15 minutes of an episode at a friend's house once

1063
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and it was like the one kept slapping the other back in time

1064
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and then like it kept happening again.

1065
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And it just had a very similar vibe to that scene in T-Bap,

1066
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
especially because Phantom kept slapping Keg for some reason.

1067
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Because it was the joke.

1068
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Because it uses funny.

1069
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It was just very...

1070
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It felt like a reference.

1071
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The question is, Nate and Ben, was the ending of this video

1072
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
a reference to this bit of a show that no one remembers

1073
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and I remember even less.

1074
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
This very specific moment from the show.

1075
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Was it a reference to that?

1076
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't think so, did you?

1077
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't think so.

1078
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Well, I didn't know if you guys knew it.

1079
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I don't know if you guys fucking were huge angry beavers fans.

1080
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I actually did.

1081
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I actually did really like Angry Beavers.

1082
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But I don't remember that specific episode.

1083
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm gonna find this fucking scene.

1084
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's the one with the beavers.

1085
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's the one with the blonde guy and the one with the red nose.

1086
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes.

1087
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I think I've seen the little beavers.

1088
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Norman something?

1089
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Angry Beavers Cow and Chicken.

1090
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
What else?

1091
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Cow and Chicken sucked Angry Beavers rule.

1092
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's my official opinion on the subject.

1093
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I remember the one where...

1094
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, God.

1095
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I remember the one I remember best is...

1096
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Okay, it was the one with...

1097
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
They have this candy or something called Lickety Splits

1098
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and it's just like a lot with like sap in the middle.

1099
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
They did gambling or something?

1100
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I think so.

1101
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, then it was like who...

1102
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
If they lost some challenge,

1103
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the other one had to be their servant for one day or something.

1104
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I remember one where they can't sleep.

1105
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Like they dare each other.

1106
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Like who can go the long way without sleeping

1107
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and eventually they get too tired to sleep

1108
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and they just stay awake for like eternity.

1109
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It was like dystopic.

1110
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay.

1111
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Hey, this is all cool and all,

1112
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
but on the subject of...

1113
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Of race and politics, God damn it.

1114
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No, no, no.

1115
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Of T-Bap Resurrection.

1116
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Let's talk more about that.

1117
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So people, in case you didn't see it,

1118
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
it's not on this channel, but on T-Bap.

1119
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's official T-Bap release.

1120
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Episode 26 of T-Bap officially.

1121
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Excluding the podcast.

1122
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's only 26.

1123
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I checked the stats and...

1124
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh my God.

1125
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Yeah, that was...

1126
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Well, I mean, so the whole podcast happened,

1127
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
but it was the 26th mainline,

1128
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
like normally edited T-Bap episode.

1129
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And it's out.

1130
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We max-revived.

1131
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It took 9,000 dollars for you to edit one of those videos.

1132
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes, it was the top award tier,

1133
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
or it was the top stretch goal for Radcon.

1134
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We hit it to max-revive T-Bap,

1135
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and we fucking did it.

1136
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It has been max-revived, although...

1137
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Which was the last promised thing from Radcon 3.

1138
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We have delivered on everything we said

1139
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
we would do at Radcon 3 officially.

1140
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And just for the record,

1141
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
it was on the exact one-year anniversary.

1142
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yes.

1143
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It was released yesterday of the day

1144
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Radcon 3 ended proper as we were doing it live

1145
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in the arena, so...

1146
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's time to start looking forward, guys.

1147
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It is.

1148
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It is.

1149
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I still want that GRPJ, goddammit, though.

1150
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That was not a promise.

1151
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That was not a Radcon promise.

1152
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, okay.

1153
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Munchy, can I put you on the spot?

1154
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
No, you can't.

1155
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You can't do that.

1156
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Okay, I won, then.

1157
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That wasn't an article in the Rad contract.

1158
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Indeed.

1159
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Indeed it was not.

1160
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, I'm curious about it.

1161
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
We can talk about it later.

1162
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
No, we can't.

1163
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I know.

1164
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I know.

1165
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What?

1166
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
No, stop.

1167
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Stop.

1168
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Hippo, you fucking bitch.

1169
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Fucking kill yourself.

1170
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Fucking kill yourself!

1171
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Fucking kill yourself!

1172
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay, all right, all right.

1173
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Okay, fine.

1174
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Let's move on to Radcon 4,

1175
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
because we gotta do it.

1176
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Wait, let me just finish my comment here,

1177
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and we can do that.

1178
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But I just want to thank everybody

1179
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
who was involved in helping.

1180
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That was Gib and Jesse, obviously,

1181
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
providing voice acting.

1182
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I really liked how that intro played out.

1183
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It was good.

1184
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I think it was great.

1185
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It was lore rich.

1186
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Despite the fact that neither of us

1187
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
listened to each other's audio,

1188
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
we had a good back and forth going.

1189
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Indeed.

1190
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We wrote out lines, so it was great.

1191
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Okay, I cannot find this fucking episode of Angry Beavers,

1192
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
but I figured out exactly what's going on in it.

1193
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
What happens is that the one beaver

1194
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
is continually annoying his brother all week,

1195
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
finding new ways to annoy him,

1196
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and then the brother bops him into last week.

1197
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That's the idea.

1198
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
He pits him so hard he goes back in time,

1199
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
but it keeps happening.

1200
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Every time he reaches the end of the week,

1201
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
he has annoyed his brother so much

1202
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
that he bops him into last week,

1203
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and it just keeps happening until he finally stops annoying him.

1204
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Fascinating.

1205
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So do more and more time clones start appearing

1206
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
because he keeps getting sent back in a time loop?

1207
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't know if it's one of those time travel versions.

1208
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't think it's like that.

1209
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's grandpa day, but beaver day.

1210
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah.

1211
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Maybe the episode's called beaver day.

1212
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
That's pretty funny.

1213
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's pretty funny.

1214
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He's got to learn his lesson or whatever.

1215
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
He's like,

1216
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I keep getting punched in the nose or whatever.

1217
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I keep getting punched.

1218
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Why does he keep repeating?

1219
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No matter what I do, I keep repeating the week.

1220
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's got to be it's got to be Norm punching.

1221
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Norm's the one who annoys Dag generally.

1222
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
No, no, no. Dag's the brown one.

1223
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah.

1224
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Is Norm kind of the smarmy, know-it-all asshole?

1225
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, but Dag is the stupid funny one.

1226
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I would imagine it was Dag annoying Norm.

1227
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay, maybe.

1228
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, that is the case.

1229
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Oh, okay.

1230
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
All right, for now.

1231
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Cha-ching.

1232
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Hey, wait.

1233
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Wait, let me finish my goddamn thank yous, goddammit.

1234
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I just want to thank-

1235
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Why are you giving a fucking Oscar acceptance speech

1236
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
over releasing the T-Bap episode?

1237
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Why is this happening?

1238
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I just want to say thank you to fit MC for recording

1239
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and Victor for filming.

1240
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's it.

1241
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That's all I wanted to fucking say.

1242
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It was a big deal, but you made it a big deal.

1243
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You unzipped me, you piece of fucking shit.

1244
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Why did you make me do this?

1245
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You ruined my Oscar acceptance speech.

1246
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It was going to be such a positive moment.

1247
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And now it's ruined.

1248
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Did fit MC voice the dad?

1249
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Is that what that was?

1250
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's not the dad.

1251
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's not their dad.

1252
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That's their manager.

1253
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That's whatever.

1254
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Or producer.

1255
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
The reason I said the dad is because I thought

1256
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that your dad had voiced him.

1257
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
No.

1258
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That would have been very interesting.

1259
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

1260
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Fit MC voiced Risky Business in T-Bap Resurrection.

1261
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Their dad, Gold Standard, appears in...

1262
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Gold Standard appears in...

1263
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Phantom Reviews?

1264
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Phantom Reviews.

1265
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes, in Phantom Reviews.

1266
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And he was voiced by Jesse.

1267
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And their mom, Angel Food, was also voiced.

1268
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And was that voiced by Jesse?

1269
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
He was voiced by Jenny Whatserface.

1270
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Jenny Nicholson.

1271
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's right.

1272
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Really?

1273
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You got her?

1274
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yes.

1275
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We also got Jenny Nicholson.

1276
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I know.

1277
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
She also played Kimmy Sparkle in the cutie marker fuffle part 3.

1278
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yes.

1279
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Which was her character.

1280
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But she also voiced Angel Food.

1281
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Which is cool.

1282
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We did it, lads.

1283
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Incidentally, for those who don't know, Ben and I...

1284
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So there was some weird thing.

1285
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We were both kind of on track to play a character in Friendship as Witchcraft.

1286
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And there is one or two lines.

1287
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I think it's actually both me and Ben doing two different bits of this character.

1288
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
This was weird.

1289
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
They were working on the next episode of Friendship as Witchcraft.

1290
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And they asked both of us to voice this character, Craig.

1291
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The character was going to be just a regular human who didn't know what was going on.

1292
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And was a completely normal person, human person in the world of Friendship as Witchcraft.

1293
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But he traveled through the Portland and became a pony.

1294
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That was the thing happening to him.

1295
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Was he?

1296
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, he walks through the portal in his first appearance.

1297
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Oh, I thought he was literally a human.

1298
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Like a human human.

1299
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
He was a human, but he walks through the portal and goes to the Pony World.

1300
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I know, but I thought he wasn't a pony.

1301
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But whatever.

1302
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay, maybe I'm wrong.

1303
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But yeah.

1304
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
There was like one line or two lines.

1305
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And I think they were going to just alternate between our voices or something.

1306
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
There was some confusion.

1307
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Look, we were fighting over this role a little bit.

1308
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So there was some...

1309
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah, we both really wanted to do it.

1310
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
There was a little bit of shenanigans going on there.

1311
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
They were like, I could be the singing voice and Ben could be the speaking voice or some shit like that.

1312
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Really?

1313
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I mean that.

1314
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yeah, that was disgust.

1315
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
The way you're describing it, it makes it feel like they approached maybe both of you to cast a wide net.

1316
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And when you both found out, they were like, oh, Jesus Christ.

1317
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I really wish they had just come and asked one of us.

1318
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I really hope the corporate red tape from that was like the reason the episode never got done.

1319
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They couldn't resolve the conflict.

1320
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm sure that was it.

1321
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
From what you described, I assumed that they were just telling you both that this guy was perfectly normal.

1322
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So you would play him that way when the reality is that he's some kind of like weird split personality.

1323
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And that they wanted to have a cycle between both of your voices the whole time.

1324
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
No, I'm afraid not.

1325
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Well, anyway, we both...

1326
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Who knows what would have happened?

1327
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1328
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I would argue that Friendship is a T-Bap was the highest produced, the highest production regular show of the Pony Review Crew.

1329
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So we certainly had the cred to take this role.

1330
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I mean, if you consider a horseshoe to not be a regular show, then...

1331
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Well, I do not.

1332
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, I do not.

1333
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Because ours was weekly and his was not.

1334
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Well, it was pretty close at first to weekly.

1335
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Not for very long.

1336
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Not for very long.

1337
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But whatever, it's not a point.

1338
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Anyway, fond memories, fond memories.

1339
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But we're canon, two Friendship is Witchcraft lore, so suck it.

1340
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Are we?

1341
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
We're in there.

1342
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah, we're in the first episode of Horsewomen. Craig shows up.

1343
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Wait, but there is no Horsewomen.

1344
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Horse... Episode one was made.

1345
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Oh my god.

1346
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Was it?

1347
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yes, Ben, yes.

1348
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Hmm, sorry, I was drunk. Sorry.

1349
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I'm intoxicated.

1350
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I was a little bit of an important to say, but angry beavers.

1351
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And that's that actually I don't never mind.

1352
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Ratcon for everybody. Here we go.

1353
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Ratcon for baby.

1354
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Maybe, eventually.

1355
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I mean, yeah, at some point.

1356
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
More lectures.

1357
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We'll see.

1358
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
We had ideas for lectures, but none of us have thought...

1359
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I have a concrete, hardcore, ready-to-go, anytime idea for a lecture.

1360
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So I'm ready.

1361
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Like no preparation required?

1362
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, I mean, I would need to draw the board other than that. Nope.

1363
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Are you keeping it under wraps?

1364
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Yes.

1365
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I haven't actually like written out or scripted anything for a lecture until we have like a plan for what we're going to do.

1366
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I mean, I know one or two that I would do.

1367
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Well, I'll drop this hint.

1368
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I don't know.

1369
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's just that I don't need to do any prep work.

1370
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I just know everything I need to know already.

1371
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So that's sick.

1372
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Sick.

1373
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Is it about Gurren Lagann?

1374
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
There's not enough material for a lecture there.

1375
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Is it about Homestuck?

1376
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Oh, God, I hope so.

1377
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't know why Nate would be doing the Homestuck lecture.

1378
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Because obviously, my famous podcast, Nate Talks About Homestuck, really shook up the metagame of YouTube and changed the world.

1379
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I have two planned lectures, but I'm not going to start researching them until we know when Radcon 4 is, because...

1380
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That could be forever.

1381
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
We got it.

1382
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Guys, let's do the Radcon 4.

1383
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We need Radcon 4 to metastasize already.

1384
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Metastasize.

1385
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah, I mean, if it's going to happen, we need to actively start thinking about it and planning it.

1386
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, because a lot of people just won't do any prep work until it's decided.

1387
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And people are like, well, I'm not going to work on it until I know what I'm going to do.

1388
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So, I mean, at some point, you just got to call it.

1389
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But that's not going to be for a while, so...

1390
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's looking at this summer.

1391
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's going to be another summer of pain where I'm racing across the map.

1392
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Just don't do that, though.

1393
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Just have a summer of good.

1394
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah, okay.

1395
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
All right.

1396
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
That's a good idea.

1397
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Hey, Mr. President.

1398
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yes.

1399
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Bang!

1400
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Sorry, guys.

1401
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I shut the present.

1402
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I knew I...

1403
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
All right, this is over.

1404
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh, no.

1405
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What even was that?

1406
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Listen, guys.

1407
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It was an assassination.

1408
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I went to Improv Asylum and I'm suing my fucking director.

1409
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He didn't teach me shit.

1410
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm trying to get some money back.

1411
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Hey, speaking of assassinating the president, you were pretty close to doing that the other day, Munchy,

1412
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
at that Bernie rally.

1413
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That's pretty cool, yeah?

1414
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Are we really going to recycle content from the bonus episode?

1415
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I just want to say we should definitely link in the show notes for non-bonus episode people

1416
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that one gift.

1417
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, okay.

1418
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
No upset.

1420
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I can't believe that gift is real.

1421
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I can't fucking believe it.

1422
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm still watching it.

1423
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
If you want to know the full story, then go to the bonus episode of Sunshine and Rainbows.

1424
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
If you just want to have confirmation that I'm there, click the link in the description

1425
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and you might melt.

1426
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Indeed.

1427
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Bernie's back in California to complete the political revolution.

1428
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And there he is!

1429
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And there Bernie is!

1430
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Just one of the boys that Bernie.

1431
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Bernie has moved his soul to a young vessel and is preparing for his new residency.

1432
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I have something that I want to bring up.

1433
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I don't have a lot to say about it, but I have a bit.

1434
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Do you guys know Petscop?

1435
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yeah, of course.

1436
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I know.

1437
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I'm thinking of the quote-unquote game.

1438
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I thought Munchy, I figured you would know about it.

1439
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
A pet shop?

1440
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
No, not Petscop.

1441
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Petscop.

1442
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It's the game, right?

1443
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It is a YouTube channel slash video series that is a let's play.

1444
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It's a let's play of a fake game and it's sort of a creepy pot.

1445
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The videos and the game itself are both like...

1446
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, I saw a game theory on this.

1447
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There is a game theory on it.

1448
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Recently I found another YouTube channel that talks about it called Nightmare Masterclass.

1449
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I have mixed feelings about Nightmare Masterclass, but I've been watching a bunch of it lately.

1450
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
He has a big examination series on Petscop.

1451
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I just think that things like Petscop are really inspiring.

1452
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I love things that are...

1453
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It has such a novel format and that plays with the medium and stuff.

1454
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think that kind of thing is so cool.

1455
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's so fucking cool to me.

1456
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Completely agree and I want to talk about Petscop a lot.

1457
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
However, I must just say that...

1458
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
What is the name?

1459
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Nightmare Mastermind?

1460
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Masterclass.

1461
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Nightmare Masterclass.

1462
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Nightmare Masterclass.

1463
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
There are so many Nightmind phony like fucking knockoffs on YouTube now.

1464
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
For some reason it's just loaded as a medium.

1465
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I have never watched Nightmind and I don't think I want to.

1466
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Nightmare Masterclass.

1467
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Why exactly?

1468
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Not that I'm really...

1469
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Okay.

1470
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So I know.

1471
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I clicked like one Nightmind video thinking that I was going to be in for some sort of

1472
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
like information dump or video essay or something and I remember there was like a...

1473
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I don't even remember what it was about.

1474
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I just remember I listened to it for 45 minutes the whole time thinking when is he going to

1475
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
actually start talking about the topic and then the video ended.

1476
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, okay.

1477
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That's a very strange experience Ben because that's his entire thing is information dump

1478
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
like down the rabbit hole ask explanation of ARGs.

1479
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Like that's what he does exclusively.

1480
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So I don't know what video you watched.

1481
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I don't know.

1482
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't know either.

1483
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It didn't impress me.

1484
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Okay.

1485
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Well.

1486
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But Nightmare...

1487
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Sounds like something I would like.

1488
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I want to see it.

1489
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Nightmare Masterclass.

1490
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
He's very...

1491
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
He will...

1492
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You know, sometimes I appreciate the spirit of like being willing to make like big logical

1493
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,880
leaps and ask what if this means something even when it's something really innocuous and

1494
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,360
maybe it doesn't mean anything at all.

1495
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,880
It's probably like Preston Jacobs.

1496
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,880
That guy isn't afraid to ask the tough questions.

1497
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,880
He's not afraid to spend a wild layout of control.

1498
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,880
He's not afraid to surmise that Quaith is bouncing telekinesis signals off the moon.

1499
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Indeed.

1500
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Indeed.

1501
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Oh man.

1502
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
That reminds me because I just...

1503
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,880
I watched the fucking Alex Jones on Joe Rogan podcast.

1504
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
It's a good one.

1505
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,880
It's a good one.

1506
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,880
It was so good.

1507
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,880
I haven't seen that one.

1508
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,880
Oh my God.

1509
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,880
Alex goes off the rail.

1510
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
I don't know if he's like this every day.

1511
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,880
Alex, he is.

1512
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,880
All right, but it's so funny.

1513
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,880
It's so funny.

1514
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,880
I honestly...

1515
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880
That does sound funny.

1516
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,880
The only Joe Rogan podcast I've watched is the Andrew Yang one as a matter of fact.

1517
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
Fair enough.

1518
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
The fucking...

1519
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,880
But it was good and I liked it.

1520
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,880
The fucking...

1521
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,880
What's his name?

1522
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,880
The Alex Jones episode is five hours long.

1523
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
Yeah.

1524
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
I enjoyed every minute of it and I am now a fan of Alex Jones.

1525
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Dude, Alex is so...

1526
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Oh boy.

1527
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Entertaining.

1528
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
He's so...

1529
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,880
Like you just have to be like this is obviously bullshit.

1530
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,880
And it's so funny.

1531
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,880
Even...

1532
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,880
I don't even find that much of what he says to be that crazy.

1533
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,880
Oh God.

1534
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,880
He talks about interdimensional elves, specifically literally interdimensional.

1535
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,880
Like when he talks about...

1536
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,880
The clockwork elves.

1537
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
You gotta kill the clockwork elves.

1538
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,880
It's just that some of the things he says, when Joe says like, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1539
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,880
you need to explain what that is, then he like elaborates and it actually is not as insane.

1540
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,880
Right.

1541
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
But it's...

1542
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,880
What he uses up front is just it blasts you with this information that obviously seems

1543
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,880
ridiculous.

1544
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,880
He's the one who says they're putting chemicals in the water and turning the frogs gay, right?

1545
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,880
Okay, that's a great example because the thing is, he's literally not even totally incorrect

1546
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,640
because what he's specifically referring to is that there is a documented chemical that

1547
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,040
was released into specific water bodies in America, I forget why, but what it did was

1548
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:19,880
it increased, I think it was actually like hermaphroditic mutations in frogs.

1549
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,840
So while it's not fair to say that it's turning them gay...

1550
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,240
That is in fact wrong, man.

1551
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Well, the point is that the way Alex Jones talks...

1552
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,240
It's basically completely wrong.

1553
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:35,240
No, listen, the way he talks, the way he explains things is he gets a piece of information that

1554
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:40,840
is crazy and is true and he has lots of these things that he talks about are verifiable

1555
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,400
and when they are, he'll say like, go Google it, you know, you Google it, you find out

1556
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,360
this fucking insane thing he said is true, but he will phrase it in a weird, somewhat

1557
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:59,920
hyperbolic way and also he will extrapolate on it into trying to understand, but at the

1558
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,480
same time, in this Joe Rogan podcast, there's a very clear self-awareness about the fact.

1559
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,760
First of all, he constantly says things like, I might be retarded or like, I'm very autistic,

1560
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,680
I'm kind of socially retarded, like he'll say things like that, right?

1561
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:26,960
And in the meantime, he also says things like, you know, I don't mean literally, like he

1562
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,000
keeps referring to aliens, but then he explains that he's like, aliens just means anything

1563
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,440
that is like, not inherently from this world.

1564
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:41,960
So he talks about, for instance, human chimeras, right, which are real, there are real experiments

1565
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:49,080
on human chimeras that were done on like the, they were only done on like a stem cell level,

1566
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:54,720
but like there are, there's not like real like human animal hybrids walking around.

1567
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,520
Your brain thinks of like a giant wolf with a human head or something, I just think of

1568
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,520
Nina.

1569
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:07,160
That is the totality of his, I mean, in this moment where he breaks down that he doesn't,

1570
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,720
like when he, when he says like, yeah, there's human chimeras, and then they look it up.

1571
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,800
And yes, there is a thing that happened.

1572
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:19,000
It's just not as extreme as it sounds, but it is not necessarily inaccurate to say that

1573
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,720
they are human chimeras, what he's describing.

1574
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,080
But then he goes on to say that like, those are aliens, because they are not something

1575
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,640
that naturally occurred on earth.

1576
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,220
So he considers it an alien species.

1577
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,320
So when he talks about aliens, he's talking about anything that falls under this huge

1578
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,360
category of what he considers aliens, you know?

1579
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,960
So basically Alex Jones says the wrong words, and that's why people get confused.

1580
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:49,840
It's kind of, it's that he, he's trying to explain something that there's not necessarily

1581
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,560
words for.

1582
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,660
And so he's making up whatever comes to his mind and trying to explain it.

1583
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:00,080
And then if you talk to him long enough, you can kind of extrapolate back and figure out

1584
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,120
what he's really talking about, and you go, oh, okay, you're just talking about this.

1585
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,620
Oh, all right.

1586
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:10,460
But yeah, that is a, there is a, because I mean, there is a lot of crazy things going

1587
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,900
on in the world, a lot of weird, you know, things that are being kept under wraps, things

1588
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:21,900
that are, uh, that are, you know, conspiratorial and like, there is some element of he's sincerely

1589
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,300
exploring these things, he's sincerely questioning and like trying to get to the heart of the

1590
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,740
matter, but he is an insane person.

1591
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,460
I mean, so the way he, the results he comes away with just sound like insane ravings, but

1592
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:39,420
you also have to look at it and go, okay, well, I at least can get that nugget of intrigue

1593
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:44,620
out of it, that nugget of what is real and is identifiable in what he's saying, and then

1594
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:48,380
try to come up with like my own take on it, you know, as opposed to trying to like, at

1595
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:53,540
some point I can switch off the Alex Jones, the vacation of the information and like consider

1596
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,700
it for myself.

1597
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,580
Um, but the stuff he talks about is fairly interesting.

1598
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,900
Like the stuff that is real is all crazy fucking shit that you're like, oh my God, that's real.

1599
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:08,100
I would make the argument that Alex Jones ladens the whatever truth he has in such levels

1600
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:14,020
of extrapolation hyperbole that it, I would make the argument that it is not worth my

1601
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,580
time to try to discern true fiction.

1602
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,580
That's very fair.

1603
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,260
The only thing that makes it that makes it worth my time is that he's so fucking entertaining.

1604
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,480
Well, that's like, he's just going, he doesn't stop.

1605
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,980
He just gets more intense.

1606
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,740
He gets more raw and like he also, he keeps saying throughout the podcast, like I've

1607
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:35,940
got Alzheimer's already, but like, and he doesn't mean it, but there's definitely something

1608
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,580
wrong with the man's brain.

1609
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,860
Like he will lose track.

1610
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,220
There's moments where he just seems to completely not know where he is anymore.

1611
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:47,700
Like he like, is it, he's ranting so fervently that he just kind of is like out of breath

1612
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,900
and he's like, what was I talking about again?

1613
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,700
Like I, I don't even, I don't even know what the fuck's going on anymore.

1614
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,460
And for a good long while, he demanded that every Eddie Bravo choke him out and make him

1615
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,460
pass out on the episode.

1616
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:07,460
He just, and like, dude, and after a little while, he was like, can we stop being pussies?

1617
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:13,180
Can you just jump in the back when he was in school?

1618
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,740
Like everybody used to choke each other at his school to get high or something.

1619
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:20,300
Yeah, they would all just choke each other all the time, which I've heard.

1620
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,820
I've heard a weird shit to get high, man.

1621
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:26,900
I used to know kids used to like, that sounds like the kind of thing that will give you

1622
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
brain damage.

1623
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,740
I used to hear about kids taking a deep breath and crouching down, jumping up, exhaling

1624
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,220
and smacking themselves in the forehead all at once.

1625
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:41,660
And it just kills some of your brain cells and makes you feel kind of high for a second.

1626
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,660
Great.

1627
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,660
Great.

1628
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,540
See, we should definitely get Alex Jones on this podcast.

1629
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,540
Yeah, we should get him on.

1630
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,540
He's looking for a platform.

1631
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,540
I would love it.

1632
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,740
Oh, I can't wait for the Munchie Alex Jones crossover.

1633
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,260
Oh, that's what we were all saying too.

1634
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,700
We were like, oh, imagine Munchie and Alex Jones in the same room.

1635
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,820
Just it would be so great.

1636
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,620
Just guess it vibe.

1637
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,820
That'd be a great episode of the Pleeve and the Weave.

1638
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,300
That's true.

1639
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,700
It would just be nonstop.

1640
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:11,180
Have you seen there's there's one clip on YouTube that some it's Alex Jones.

1641
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,380
So this wasn't intentional.

1642
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,860
It's just a clip from him on his first appearance and Joe Rogan, I think.

1643
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:20,260
And it's just Alex Jones explains the plot of Evangelion and then purely

1644
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:25,700
basically by accident, he details how he interprets like the modern political and

1645
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,420
like technological landscape about breakaway societies and whatnot.

1646
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,180
And that's it's literally silly.

1647
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:36,340
OK, literally like the what's called the in the Joe Rogan episode.

1648
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:40,940
It's like everything he describes is the plot of something like it's all

1649
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,260
it all sci-fi.

1650
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,540
It's all relatable to something.

1651
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,220
It's all like speculative fiction.

1652
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:49,380
Like it's it's clear from that podcast that he is very well read.

1653
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:56,100
Like he's read a lot of futurism texts and shit and like seen tons of sci-fi.

1654
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,540
And like the way he just throws out terminology like very, you know,

1655
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,420
casually sounds like somebody talking about sci-fi, like talking about an anime or something.

1656
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:10,540
And like I remember several times that he was just like describing plots of shows

1657
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,420
that I was like, oh, my God, that's isn't that just

1658
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,620
yeah, like Eva or Lane, especially.

1659
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,220
Yeah, yeah, that too.

1660
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,700
There is a channel called Art House Politics, which is somewhat

1661
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,940
I don't know, it may be divisive to the fans of the show.

1662
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,220
However, I think it's really funny and crazy.

1663
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,260
And I love it.

1664
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:37,060
And they have a video that is I'm going to link it.

1665
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,460
It's going to be in the show notes, hopefully.

1666
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,820
I'll just explain the world as a whole.

1667
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:44,300
It's just a clip of Alex Jones, which he has laid in visuals over

1668
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,460
in a in a in a very humorous way.

1669
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,140
And this is the video that I think about whenever I think about Alex Jones.

1670
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,660
Who loves to watch this.

1671
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,500
Like he talks in such circles that like having an infographic

1672
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,540
trying to like illustrate what he's communicating is harder than you would imagine.

1673
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:05,260
Like like one of the claims that he'll make a lot is he'll just say he'll just throw out there.

1674
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,300
There's at least 12 dimensions.

1675
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,660
And I'm like, but the thing is he's talking about like string theory.

1676
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,900
He'll say he'll say at least 12 dimensions, 10 proven.

1677
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,900
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1678
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,540
Wait, is he talking about that like 10?

1679
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,620
You know that YouTube video that he's definitely talking about that?

1680
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,420
Yeah, that's that's not just one video, by the way.

1681
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,540
That's a guy's entire channel that has hundreds of videos.

1682
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,460
Yeah, but there's like the one that started it.

1683
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,620
Yeah, well, the one that that's the funny thing about the 10 dimensions thing

1684
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,780
is that if you just watch the one original video, you're like, OK,

1685
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,860
cool, sounds reasonable.

1686
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,500
Then you see that the guy has like hundreds of hours of explaining

1687
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,420
that same point and it no longer seems reasonable anymore.

1688
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,780
That's interesting.

1689
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,060
Weird. OK.

1690
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:54,420
Um, why does he so why does Alex Jones say 12 dimensions, 10 proven?

1691
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,180
And what what's he getting at?

1692
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,140
Who the fuck knows?

1693
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:57,860
I don't know.

1694
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,820
Well, where's the nugget of truth, Digi?

1695
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,460
Where's the nugget of truth?

1696
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,580
Oh, well, I mean, I guess the nugget of truth is that there's

1697
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,500
possibly multiple dimensions.

1698
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,500
I mean, like the main thing that that resonated with me about Joe Rogan's

1699
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:16,100
whole spiel is this idea that he seems to think similarly to how I do

1700
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:20,620
that like humans are all we're basically trying to, you know, escape

1701
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:24,740
entropy, make it to the next sort of exit the dimension that we are in

1702
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:29,100
or achieve achieve awareness of a higher dimension so that we are not limited

1703
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,140
to the one that's, you know, this universe that's coming to an end, so to speak.

1704
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,780
And this he knows that's not what these dimensions are, right?

1705
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,740
These aren't like planes of existence that one can move between.

1706
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,820
No, the fourth dimension time or something.

1707
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,780
Yes, the fourth dimension.

1708
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,740
I don't remember the time.

1709
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:49,460
I don't remember the details of the ten dimensional thing, but it's something like that.

1710
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:53,580
There was a lot of talk of DMT and how it like allows you to access

1711
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,500
the fourth dimension potentially.

1712
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,460
This is crazy shit.

1713
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,540
See, I don't get down with that too much.

1714
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,620
But then again, I've never tried.

1715
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,460
So I got to try DMT.

1716
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,700
I got to do it.

1717
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,660
Everyone says I have to do it.

1718
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,980
Well, your oh, it's your brain.

1719
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,260
Yeah.

1720
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,220
Before you die, here's cancer.

1721
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,820
I learned that the other day.

1722
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,020
Well, that's good.

1723
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,220
But did you know that bank here is retardation?

1724
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:15,900
Oh, yeah.

1725
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,540
Oh, I'm talking it right now.

1726
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,740
It's not working, though.

1727
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,540
It's not working.

1728
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,660
I need to chug faster.

1729
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,100
It's not taking effect.

1730
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,100
Let's talk.

1731
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:24,860
Let's talk about.

1732
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,180
All right.

1733
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:30,020
So you discovered this energy drink called bang that I want to find.

1734
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,820
I'm going to try and find it in seven.

1735
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,980
Better be quick because I don't know if it'll be around forever.

1736
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,860
Oh, did you just you just happened to have been contacted

1737
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,780
in like the attempt to get you to like help take down big bang.

1738
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,620
Like big, big pharma.

1739
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,660
Yeah.

1740
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:48,260
Yeah, and apparently there's claims.

1741
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,460
There's like it's being sued by a bunch of people

1742
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,140
because it makes a bunch of claims, including but not limited to

1743
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,820
that it cures retardation.

1744
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:55,060
Yeah.

1745
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,540
OK, OK.

1746
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:55,900
All right.

1747
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,540
Well, here's the history of bang

1748
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,220
because this is an extremely long drawn out issue that is so

1749
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:04,540
that there truly is a big bang of information.

1750
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,500
This is exploded out in the past couple of days.

1751
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,940
This is this is being covered in the news.

1752
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:09,900
This is crazy.

1753
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,740
This is what we're going on right now.

1754
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:16,780
So I get back from a trip to Boston and I go to my local 7-Eleven

1755
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,660
for the energy drink run, which I always virtually do every single night.

1756
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,820
And I go there and I see next to the monster.

1757
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,340
I see a new kind of look.

1758
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:31,340
I see bang, super creatine, potent brain and body fuel.

1759
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,180
And now if you will indulge me, I just want to read the label,

1760
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,620
which is on the back of every single bank bottle,

1761
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:41,500
which is what compelled me to try out a few of the distinct and odd flavors.

1762
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,500
So bang, potent brain and body fuel.

1763
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,980
Make no mistake.

1764
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,060
Bang is not your stereotypical high sugar, life-sucking soda,

1765
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:52,940
masquerade as an energy drink.

1766
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:57,500
High sugar drinks spike blood pressure levels, producing metabolic mayhem,

1767
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,020
causing you to crash harder than a test dummy into a brick wall.

1768
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,340
Power up with bangs, potent brain and body rocking fuel.

1769
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:12,780
Creatine caffeine, COQ, 10 and BACs, branch chain amino acids.

1770
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:18,940
Life is an extreme sport and bang is the extreme energy source to live life extreme.

1771
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:24,060
All three of those extremes are spelled without an E, so it's extreme.

1772
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,020
And then there's a TM at the end.

1773
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,260
You had to be 18 years or older.

1774
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,940
Wait, do they each have a TM?

1775
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,940
Yes.

1776
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,900
They couldn't have trademarked extreme, right?

1777
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,380
No, no, no, I'm saying the end of that.

1778
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,460
Life is an extreme sport is tiered.

1779
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,700
OK, OK, gotcha.

1780
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,580
That's a little better.

1781
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,900
It's not much better.

1782
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:50,660
Zero zero carbs, zero sugars, zero calories, zero artificial colorings.

1783
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,900
And I am patient.

1784
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,860
What's in the number?

1785
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:57,500
I'm patient number, I believe eight million, eight point five million.

1786
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,380
I'm patient eight point five.

1787
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,100
Do they actually say a patient number?

1788
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,500
Yes. What is that about?

1789
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,460
That's hilarious.

1790
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,380
Like this is the one that's killing you, the eight millionth bangs produced.

1791
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,180
Right. So it's to be almost like a like a doctor,

1792
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,700
like like it's making some medicinal claims.

1793
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,940
It seems well, it is.

1794
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,500
It says that it reverses retardation.

1795
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:21,020
Yeah, it seems like this drink needs a disclaimer on it.

1796
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:25,620
Like this product is not meant to diagnose or cure any disease or really retardation.

1797
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:28,980
Be simply, but it doesn't just it doesn't say cure.

1798
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,860
Retardation says reverse mental retardation.

1799
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,940
I feel I feel like it's definitely like a funny joke.

1800
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,100
You'll actually be smarter than a regular person.

1801
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,740
I just didn't think people would take.

1802
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,300
No, it seems reverse retardation in the sense of the more retarded you are now,

1803
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,940
it will flip the script and you'll be even more intelligent.

1804
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,940
Once you drink this thing, it will, you'll have reverse retardation.

1805
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,620
Right, right.

1806
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,780
Hold on, this, the bottle.

1807
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,860
OK, I am intrigued by the bottle and there are some numerous strange flavors.

1808
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,700
Just as a cotton candy flavor, which I purchased.

1809
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:06,260
This cotton candy flavored energy drink, I get it, tastes pretty good, actually.

1810
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:10,380
Tastes kind of strange, actually, not really like monsters I've had.

1811
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:14,500
It's it's carbonated, but very mildly carbonated.

1812
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:20,860
It kind of tastes like a water, but just has an extremely, extremely

1813
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:25,900
potent, unbelievably potent, like they put too much serum in it.

1814
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,340
Con candy flavor, so I'm intrigued by this odd delicacy,

1815
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:36,020
which I am partaking in, and then begins my stumble down the bang rabbit hole.

1816
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,900
And I just became a fanatic for this energy drink after navigating

1817
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,260
to their official website.

1818
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:45,260
If you care to join me, bang dash energy dot com.

1819
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:49,140
And you'll be confronted with sites unknown.

1820
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,780
Dude, you're going to be studying more colors than you borrowed for.

1821
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,740
I want a pair of bang kicks.

1822
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,580
So fuck yeah.

1823
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,540
Yeah, OK, OK, OK, so they don't have just bang, nor do they have just other,

1824
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:03,820
you know, you know, this bag is marketed semi as a workout thing.

1825
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,500
So they have, you know, protein powder and, you know, keto coffee.

1826
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,380
They don't even have just drinks, delicacies, though.

1827
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,300
They have a peril that commercials.

1828
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,700
They have healthy keto recipes so you can make your own queue.

1829
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,740
Delicacies using the protein powder at various points in the recipe.

1830
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,420
They have events.

1831
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,860
They have a whole ton of YouTube videos.

1832
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:30,020
They have the bang anti diet, rapid body remodeling blast fat fast

1833
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,860
with the CEO, Jack, like literally Jack.

1834
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,060
Oh, whoa, spelled like, oh, whoa.

1835
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,580
With a C at the end.

1836
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:42,300
A walk, a walk, a walk, a walk, a walk, Jack, a walk.

1837
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,580
So I so the the intrigue to me about this, I received an email

1838
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,500
and I've seen the bang energy in stores.

1839
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,660
I've seen I've also seen some of the other stuff by the company

1840
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,980
because it's by a company called VPX Sports who does like all kinds of energy

1841
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,780
drinks, they also do red line is another thing you can buy.

1842
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:06,100
Yeah, I'd heard of I just linked to their protein drink, protein rush.

1843
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,940
And they also had what was the fucking bar that I've seen at the store?

1844
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,980
Oh, the zero impact bars.

1845
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:16,700
Well, apparently, so I got an email from just someone out of nowhere.

1846
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,140
The email is called campaign opportunity about false advertising.

1847
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,380
It says, I'm writing to see if you're interested in working with us

1848
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,980
on a campaign to help prioritize the case with the FDA.

1849
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:29,940
Bang Energy has eight active lawsuits due to false advertising and marketing.

1850
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,780
Check out the truth about bang.com to learn more.

1851
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,500
I'm sure you can think of some real interesting things to talk about

1852
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,660
once you visit the website.

1853
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,140
If you would like to participate in this campaign to help spread the truth

1854
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,340
and prioritize this case with the FDA, please apply here and let us know what it

1855
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,180
would cost to collaborate. So what the fuck?

1856
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:50,820
So these people are offering me money to help spread the word

1857
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:54,820
about the FDA case against bang energy,

1858
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,740
which I don't know.

1859
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,180
I don't know why I would get contacted about this.

1860
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,260
Yeah, I don't know if I'm just if it's just random,

1861
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:06,140
this guy is just emailing everybody with a fucking platform on earth or what?

1862
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,540
But if you go to the truth about bang.com,

1863
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,820
it's basically just about how they've made all these false claims

1864
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,860
about the energy drink, such as that it contains an enhanced form of creatine.

1865
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,860
Not true as a patent on super creatine.

1866
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,100
Not true can reverse mental retardation, cure Alzheimer's disease,

1867
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,980
Parkinson's, Huntington's, other forms of dementia.

1868
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1869
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,780
But at the bottom of the page, it says, don't get bang boozled.

1870
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,980
America is noticing.

1871
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,980
I've been banged.

1872
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,540
Fucking sneakers.

1873
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,700
Frequently in what is it?

1874
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,460
Defeat bang. Is it the truth about the truth about bang?

1875
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,540
The truth about bang.com.

1876
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:48,620
Yeah. There are videos from the CEO

1877
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,820
Jack, which I don't know why all CEOs are named Jack now,

1878
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,940
but that's just how it is.

1879
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,140
Yeah, that's what they do.

1880
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:00,460
So if you also want to mose on over to VPX sports on YouTube,

1881
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,660
I will also link that here.

1882
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:07,660
They have a lot of videos dedicated to bang, many of which featuring Jack.

1883
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:13,220
And let me just say Jack is my personal hero

1884
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,460
and someone who I look up quite a bit.

1885
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:20,380
He is quite the intense frantic man.

1886
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,140
Almost Alex Jones, which depends on the video.

1887
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,620
Sometimes I think he hasn't

1888
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,500
drank in a bang before recording, but in many he has.

1889
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,140
And he has a he has a this is going to sound strange.

1890
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,500
I would describe him as like a mixture

1891
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,940
between Alex Jones and Butch Hartman, a fairly odd parents name.

1892
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:41,180
That's kind of does he display all the outward symptoms of reverse retardation?

1893
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:44,220
I think he has an IQ well into the triple digits.

1894
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,460
Well, OK, great.

1895
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,980
So I I got really down this.

1896
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,100
This is like a weird coincidence, right?

1897
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,780
Digi, that we're both like now entangled in the bang.

1898
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,460
Yeah, totally.

1899
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,580
Independent of one another.

1900
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,100
Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.

1901
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:06,180
So if you want, I will select some some videos for your enjoyment.

1902
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:08,580
But needless to say, this YouTube channel is

1903
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,740
a shuck full of great parody level videos

1904
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:16,740
and commercials advertising bang as if it were like a joke.

1905
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,900
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

1906
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,980
Digi, please don't take down Big Bang

1907
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,620
until I've tried that cotton candy.

1908
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:26,820
I'm inclined to think that this might have even been inspired by Alex Jones,

1909
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,380
who is by a supplement shill.

1910
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,740
Like that's what he does. Yeah, that's true.

1911
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,940
Because looking at these, it's like it's the same set up of like guy

1912
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:38,420
at a desk with a big expensive mic with a green screen background

1913
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,820
that is probably just in his house.

1914
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:45,460
And like, yeah, these videos are pretty hilarious.

1915
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:52,180
Also, the the banner of the YouTube is just a bunch of chicks in bikinis,

1916
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:55,900
but with just their tits and bellies.

1917
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,700
No faces.

1918
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:02,140
No, this is so blatantly, it has to be thick, right?

1919
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:05,500
But then you can go to several of it and get your cotton candy flavored bang.

1920
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,700
It's not a joke.

1921
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:11,180
Yeah, to be fair, this might be pointing to their sculpted abdomens.

1922
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,660
You know, I'm looking at the website.

1923
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,580
I'm looking at the Rainbow Unicorn Fitness Collection.

1924
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,660
It's nice. It's like, well, these are these are keto, by the way.

1925
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,340
They have the meltdown keto caffeine free.

1926
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:23,500
How to make a keto pumpkin cheesecake?

1927
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,500
Yeah, there's a ton of keto recipes on the YouTube channel.

1928
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,300
Yeah, this is good.

1929
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,220
Older, you know, Ben, it sounds like.

1930
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,180
And I mean, their clothes look like they would be in Endless War.

1931
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,900
So clearly, they do.

1932
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,780
Clearly, bang needs to be the official energy drink of Endless War.

1933
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:43,540
Wait, I. OK, but I'm going to post a picture.

1934
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,660
Look at this.

1935
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,740
They're they're advertising. They're advertising slime.

1936
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,660
Here we go. Bam.

1937
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,380
This is what they want.

1938
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,060
This is what they want us all to be consuming.

1939
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,300
Smoothie bowl. That's literally slime.

1940
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,540
They're just repurposing slime.

1941
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,500
The colors like slime.

1942
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,420
That's fucking funny.

1943
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,020
You know, you know, Nate, can you can you let us know the inside?

1944
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,060
Is Jack Owowick also the CEO of Slime Corp?

1945
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:12,940
I, you know, number one, the N1 doesn't like us to talk about his personal affairs.

1946
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:16,340
So I can't I can't, you know, that's not relevant to our discussion right here.

1947
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,540
There's a there's a there's a lot of our

1948
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,340
layoffs of security you got to go through before you get a.

1949
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,100
What's the connection about the big man?

1950
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,940
What's the connection between Andrew Bang and Jack Owow?

1951
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1952
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,340
Oh, my God, there's Andrew Gang.

1953
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,900
There's Andrew Bang.

1954
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,100
They're going to go head to head real soon.

1955
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:37,260
Andrew, Andrew Gang is just Andrew Yang's body on top of Jack Owowick, by the way.

1956
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:42,340
It's Andrew Yang's body with with a Jack Owow's brain put into it.

1957
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:44,420
It's OK. A thousand miles per hour.

1958
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,260
Oh, it's like 120 FPS.

1959
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,100
I don't know what's specifically keto about any of this stuff,

1960
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:53,260
other than the fact that it's low carb, but whatever.

1961
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,940
Well, they had some some specifically keto drink on the side, I guess.

1962
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:02,060
Yeah. But I don't know what is I don't know what is keto about it.

1963
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,940
Like, pretty much the only thing about keto is that it is having low carbs.

1964
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,220
Yeah, you can probably make that claim about lots of stuff.

1965
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,820
I'm sure I'm sure water is keto.

1966
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,180
You know, like just probably make the same claim about Monster Ultra, for example.

1967
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,020
Yeah, there you go.

1968
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,140
Or like literally any diet drink.

1969
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,700
Yeah, or water. Yeah.

1970
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,860
Water, for example.

1971
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,860
Highly keto.

1972
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,300
God, this bang rainbow unicorn just looks so cool.

1973
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,060
Bangster berry killers.

1974
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,500
Fuck purple and white and black.

1975
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,820
Got to get me some.

1976
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,820
I've been marketed to you so effectively.

1977
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,980
I'm going to staff my suitcase with bangs

1978
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,980
and I'm going to bring it next time I come to Boston.

1979
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,700
And you're going to be able to try some.

1980
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,860
I'm going to smuggle you some. Don't worry.

1981
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,220
We're going to sell this one for all.

1982
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,620
I should just walk to Davis Square and just just I just got to be like,

1983
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,500
hey, Mr. Mr. 711, Mr.

1984
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,100
Mr. Dr. 711 CEO of 711 Corporation.

1985
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,340
You got any bang for me? Thanks.

1986
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,060
I bet they do. I hope so.

1987
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,620
Please, God. Maybe you get your own.

1988
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,020
Maybe, maybe.

1989
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,180
Anyway, so bang is is an endless joy.

1990
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,900
Just just navigate their website.

1991
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,660
Look at all of the crazy shit they have on display here.

1992
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,900
All the stuff that you can buy.

1993
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,060
There's so many.

1994
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,300
There's so much. It's a lifestyle brand is what it is.

1995
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,820
It is.

1996
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,820
Do they utilize the phrase bang for your buck anyway?

1997
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,060
No, I don't think so.

1998
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,100
No, these are extremely expensive.

1999
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,460
You don't want to be thinking about that.

2000
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:28,100
They are extreme. Why are they so much money?

2001
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:32,260
OK, at 711, they're like a normal drink, right?

2002
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,660
They're a normal drink.

2003
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:37,380
But these are like $50 for a 12 pack.

2004
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,900
Some of them are insane.

2005
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,620
Some of them are insanely expensive,

2006
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,220
and some of them are just a little expensive.

2007
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,340
They they there's like no real like pattern to how they're priced.

2008
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,260
Just like the weird the weirder ones cost more.

2009
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,420
Maybe I don't know.

2010
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,660
Maybe they're hard to manufacture something like that.

2011
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:56,380
Maybe like the keto coffee ones are more expensive

2012
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,540
than just the 12 pack of the cotton candy.

2013
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,740
Like the newer the newer flavors just cost like double.

2014
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:04,780
I think some of these are like $96 for a 12 pack

2015
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,620
for some of like to highly specialized ones.

2016
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,500
What the fuck? That's insane.

2017
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,740
It's a racket, right?

2018
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,140
Bang variety, 12 pack, $31.99.

2019
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,220
And that's not crazy.

2020
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,500
That's I guess that's fine.

2021
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,060
All right, I've had enough fucking bang.

2022
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,620
Yeah, yeah, move on to.

2023
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,100
Hey, hey, clip clip that clip at everyone.

2024
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,660
Clip clip saying did you doesn't want any more.

2025
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,220
I just want to say I just got a hilarious

2026
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:27,820
OK, so I got to say whatever.

2027
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,860
You know how with with the T-Bap stuff,

2028
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,660
I never once on T-Bap ever linked best guy ever stuff

2029
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,900
up to this very day.

2030
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,860
The first time I ever did was yesterday

2031
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,260
with T-Bap resurrection at the very end said like,

2032
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,540
hey, look what Kagan fans were up to.

2033
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,780
And I linked our channels.

2034
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,860
I just I just saw of a first comment.

2035
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:48,500
It's on my Gernlog and part two review.

2036
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:52,940
It's a proto gen solace with a pony avatar

2037
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,380
just saying this is such a good fucking video.

2038
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,500
Holy shit.

2039
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:00,540
We've got the crossover that's been achieved at long last.

2040
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,060
Hell, yeah.

2041
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,060
There was at least one subscriber to mine there.

2042
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:06,020
I already I already I already I already I already I already

2043
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,820
T-Bap comments like, yeah,

2044
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:12,220
surprise that they knew best guy ever and kickstand it,

2045
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:15,500
but they didn't make the connection until just the people do that.

2046
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,660
I don't understand how it.

2047
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:20,340
I had already cashed that check

2048
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,860
because when I started this Pokemon Sunnuz lock,

2049
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,460
I announced it on on TV.

2050
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,420
All right.

2051
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:29,260
I never had I already got a whole girlfriend out of that video.

2052
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:34,620
Oh, God, I mean, frankly, Michelle was a fan of T-Bap as well.

2053
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:39,180
And so I mean, we met much later, like during Mia Maffova.

2054
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,220
But it was originally with T-Bap.

2055
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:45,820
Michelle Watch was a fan of I mean, I guess she must figure out

2056
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,860
that you existed. I suppose I believe her.

2057
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:53,500
But, you know, suspect it is very we got to open an investigation.

2058
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,260
I think she might be a spy from Big Bang.

2059
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,700
She does love her energy drinks.

2060
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,940
All right. Not every episode has to be two and a half hours, guys.

2061
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,580
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to go to to voicemails.

2062
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,420
We might want to go to voicemails.

2063
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,300
Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'm for that.

2064
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:13,020
All right. I say, let's do it.

2065
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,500
I mean, we go to voicemails proper.

2066
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,700
We've got to check in with our with our current people

2067
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,980
investigating the elusive pizza party podcast.

2068
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:25,900
I don't have the I don't have the sound to queued up the intro music, whatever.

2069
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,820
Come on. I tweeted I tweeted at Rebel Taxi.

2070
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,060
Oh, I saw that. Yeah.

2071
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:37,620
And I included an ill he's he's mysteriously silent on suspicious.

2072
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,900
I'd say very, very suspicious.

2073
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,620
I was not here for this whole saga.

2074
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,260
Can someone explain to me what's happening?

2075
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,500
You don't you know, you don't know.

2076
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,860
Really? You miss the whole thing?

2077
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,540
That's what we're investigating the whereabouts of the podcast.

2078
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:52,900
Yeah, the so called podcast.

2079
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,100
It is it is ongoing yet to be found.

2080
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,620
The answers are just not forthcoming.

2081
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,620
But you know, the whole hashtag.

2082
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:01,060
Where's the podcast?

2083
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,340
No one can find it. There's no clues.

2084
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,500
Where's the podcast? No one knows.

2085
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,220
Understood. OK, so let's go to it.

2086
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,660
We've got someone reporting on the scene.

2087
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,740
This is electronic warbear.

2088
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:15,260
He's got some comments to say.

2089
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,420
So let's hear from him. Go.

2090
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,940
I've started my safari of the urban jungle of Atlanta.

2091
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,340
And what is this?

2092
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:29,020
A con for animation and gaming, Momo con.

2093
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,780
And who is this special guesting at this con?

2094
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,660
Why the pizza party podcast?

2095
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:43,060
Oh, my God, I've begun my mission to find the podcast.

2096
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,580
Yeah. Hashtag.

2097
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,300
Fulls errands. Boots on the ground.

2098
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,740
I appreciate it. Yeah, we've got it.

2099
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:52,220
We've got my fucking vision when black after you said Momo.

2100
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,380
And I just had I just started thinking about the Momo challenge

2101
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:58,900
and how and how much of my failure I am for not finishing the Momo challenge.

2102
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:02,060
Well, we've got a so we've got a soldier on the scene.

2103
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,260
We've got a special agent.

2104
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,420
Frankly, I fear for his well being. Me too.

2105
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,180
I mean, when he discovers that it's all a sham.

2106
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,740
Oh, I'm sure they'll show up.

2107
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:13,940
I'm sure some some agents, some blank faced, you know, glassy eyed agents

2108
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:17,180
will show up to this quote unquote pizza party podcast panel.

2109
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,740
But we all know that it's all a facade below the service.

2110
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,140
There is no podcast going on underneath there.

2111
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,620
Why do they even have a fucking Momo con appearance?

2112
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,580
They don't talk about anime.

2113
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,020
Well, because they're they said it's like a cartoon or animation.

2114
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,500
Con, I guess. I don't know.

2115
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,460
There's no. Why is rebel?

2116
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,980
Why is rebel taxis avatar so hideous and a bad?

2117
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,300
It's just very abstract.

2118
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,100
I don't know what it means or is it's awful.

2119
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,580
I guys, I showed you the Toy Story.

2120
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,100
Let's play it.

2121
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,100
Red Con 3.5.

2122
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,100
Yeah, indeed.

2123
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,020
Indeed, which is pretty funny.

2124
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:49,980
Yeah.

2125
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,100
Have we that to the people or the people aware of that?

2126
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,260
Because that is incredible.

2127
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:58,500
I I mean, all that needs to be said is just watch the first episode of

2128
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,940
toy pan pizzas Toy Story.

2129
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,140
Let's play and just watch it to the end and trust me.

2130
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,700
That's the first episode.

2131
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,820
Yeah, this is your intro to this.

2132
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:10,180
I can only imagine where it goes from the intro of the video.

2133
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,380
It's clickety-clack down the track.

2134
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,100
That's what he says to start out the episode.

2135
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,660
And it goes so, so far downhill.

2136
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:17,540
OK, you'll know.

2137
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,820
You'll know when you hear that clicking and clacking.

2138
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,260
OK, let's go to the actual voicemails here.

2139
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,140
Oh, this is this is appropriate.

2140
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,620
This first mail is from fuck the PPP.

2141
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,220
Long live the PCP.

2142
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,140
Hey, there we go.

2143
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:30,660
Sounds good.

2144
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:31,100
Yeah.

2145
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,780
Yeah, we exist, bitches.

2146
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,460
Commands.

2147
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,780
So I just wanted to say that the last episode of the PCP was some.

2148
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:41,900
Yeah, and I do not mean gay shit.

2149
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:44,500
I mean, yeah.

2150
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,220
OK, yeah.

2151
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,260
First of all, Pokemon.

2152
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,580
What the fuck is a Pikachu?

2153
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:52,700
Second of all, you didn't play maintro.

2154
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,900
Although the version by Ben and Nick was very nice.

2155
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,540
Oh, sorry about that.

2156
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,780
Capitalism.

2157
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:03,580
Nate, why don't you come hang out in this slum?

2158
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,740
Why don't you come to South America?

2159
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,820
Literally home to Brazil.

2160
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,660
And to call the money from.

2161
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,700
Why don't you get some perspective?

2162
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,940
Lots of all, what the fuck is going on with the editor contest?

2163
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,340
You know, I want to make some money.

2164
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:17,900
Oh, yeah.

2165
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:20,260
Get out of this fucking awful place.

2166
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:22,420
There is Argentina.

2167
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,620
But I can't if I use fuckers don't say that I won't.

2168
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,700
I want the contest.

2169
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:28,700
I won't.

2170
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,700
I won't.

2171
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,820
How do you fix a party podcast?

2172
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,500
Well, thank you.

2173
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,540
Appreciate that.

2174
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,020
I'm glad I said that.

2175
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:37,940
I put that in.

2176
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:39,220
I just wanted to say, hey, everybody who's

2177
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,340
waiting to hear back about the editor contest,

2178
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,100
we're still voting and deliberating.

2179
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:43,940
You will hear back.

2180
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,020
So we haven't forgot.

2181
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,540
Obviously, it's high priority.

2182
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,940
I've already cussed my judgment.

2183
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,060
Indeed, most of us have.

2184
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:52,060
Listen, I edited the last episode,

2185
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,380
and it ruined my whole week.

2186
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,100
It was a nightmare.

2187
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:54,620
I hated it.

2188
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,660
I'm never doing it again.

2189
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,460
I'm so fucking eager to pick a winner

2190
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,180
and never edit another podcast.

2191
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,020
Well, that's great, Ben, because I

2192
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,300
think you're one of the people we're

2193
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,740
waiting to hear from in terms of your votes.

2194
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,140
OK, yeah, I should.

2195
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,700
OK, I'll send you the list.

2196
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:08,660
I've got the list.

2197
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,100
My B. OK, all right.

2198
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,340
I have to do it, too, so I'm dragging ass.

2199
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,020
OK, next one, let me see.

2200
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:18,540
This voicemail here is from Arith Dyes.

2201
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,300
I notice he says, Arith, not Arith.

2202
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,380
I appreciate that.

2203
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:23,780
Go.

2204
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:26,860
OK, I've been playing Final Fantasy VII,

2205
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,900
and I just realized that, like, Arith fucking dies.

2206
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,860
And I'm at that point, and that happened.

2207
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:33,580
And like, do you get her back?

2208
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,860
Or is she dead forever?

2209
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,500
What the fuck?

2210
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,620
Oh, I love that music.

2211
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,620
I grinded her levels of shit.

2212
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,420
She's gone now.

2213
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:41,100
What the fuck?

2214
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,700
I want her back.

2215
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,700
Ah!

2216
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,180
Is this one of those things where it's like he's known

2217
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:49,180
forever that Arith dies, but when it actually happens,

2218
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,380
he's like, oh, she actually died.

2219
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,740
Yeah, like, I actually spent like 20 hours grinding her levels.

2220
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,380
I just thought this was a meme.

2221
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,380
Yeah.

2222
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,660
You knew she was going to die.

2223
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,180
Why didn't you?

2224
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,660
Why didn't you just not grind her?

2225
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,460
Why didn't you prepare yourself?

2226
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,020
I mean, to be fair, that's it's.

2227
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,980
He didn't think they would actually do it, the Madman.

2228
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,780
It's kind of like that argument that's like, you know,

2229
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:14,020
like, if you think that ex-mechanic is in a game,

2230
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,300
is overpowered, then just don't use the mechanic, bro.

2231
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:19,780
Like, impose your own difficulty challenges.

2232
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,540
Like, I would argue it is a, look, I mean,

2233
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,340
I love that Arith's died.

2234
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:23,780
That's dope.

2235
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:26,460
But it is technically kind of like a flaw

2236
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,820
that you can invest time and resources grinding a character

2237
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:29,580
only to have them removed.

2238
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,500
What do you mean it's tech?

2239
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,180
I don't know.

2240
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2241
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,820
No, it's not a flaw.

2242
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,140
It can be annoying.

2243
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,060
It's a good thing.

2244
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:39,420
It's literally a good thing because you have more

2245
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,620
than a story reason to care about Arith.

2246
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,220
You know, that's true.

2247
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:42,720
Yeah.

2248
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,340
For story sense, that's true.

2249
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,780
You have a gameplay reason.

2250
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:48,140
I'm just saying, like, if you just say on a gameplay side

2251
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,860
alone, and you spend a much time grinding a character,

2252
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,340
especially if you played the first time, you don't know.

2253
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,100
Oh, that adds to it.

2254
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,660
Well, imagine if in the remake they made it so that all

2255
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,220
of her XP goes to your other characters when she dies.

2256
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,060
I don't even want that.

2257
01:34:59,060 --> 01:34:59,980
I don't even want that.

2258
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,700
I mean, you could complain about it.

2259
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,100
Someone might not like it.

2260
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,980
That doesn't make it a flaw.

2261
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,900
OK, fair enough.

2262
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,700
I guess it kind of depends on your perspective,

2263
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,820
but OK, I get the point.

2264
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,340
OK, now actually, I'll fucking fight.

2265
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,820
I'll fucking fight someone criticizing that,

2266
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:15,540
because that's great.

2267
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,300
It's just great.

2268
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:16,900
Totally hippo.

2269
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:17,380
Yeah, hippo.

2270
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:18,260
You're right.

2271
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,060
You're invested.

2272
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:20,060
You're invested because you work.

2273
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:20,620
Yeah, that's true.

2274
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:23,060
It feels like a real loss, especially if you fucking got

2275
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,980
her fourth level limit, which you can get by that point,

2276
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,940
even though it's hard, but whatever.

2277
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:30,460
By the way, next voicemail is from, I think

2278
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,540
it's senior, sad, and depressed.

2279
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,140
It's like SR period, so I assume it's senior.

2280
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,180
Maybe it's senior?

2281
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,980
I don't know.

2282
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,740
But this is another one about loss.

2283
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:43,300
SR period definitely means senior.

2284
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:43,780
Does it?

2285
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,900
OK, senior, sad, it's senior.

2286
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,740
It would go at the end of a word, because like the opposite

2287
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,300
of junior.

2288
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:50,940
It's at the beginning.

2289
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,500
I choose to pick senior.

2290
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,660
I think it's senior.

2291
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,020
Maybe it's senator.

2292
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,580
Oh, it might be.

2293
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,660
OK, let's hear what you have to say, sir.

2294
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,220
Hang on, it's loading.

2295
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:04,780
There it goes.

2296
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,300
Mr. Sander, please.

2297
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:10,060
Mr. Best Man, in all times you mention girl and log in,

2298
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,260
please explain why in all the videos

2299
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,220
that I've watched before now, where you've done so,

2300
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:20,740
you never once said that Simone's brother is Kamina.

2301
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:24,300
So I was thinking like, oh, you know, Simone's brother dies,

2302
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,380
but you know, they're not actually real blood

2303
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,620
siblings, and he can't die, right?

2304
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,060
And so I just never thought about it.

2305
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,860
Then when you get to episode nine, you're just there,

2306
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,420
and he kisses Yoko, and they're going into a fight,

2307
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:40,580
and you're just thinking like, does he actually die?

2308
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,740
I know, I was thinking that too.

2309
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,740
I pause it at that point.

2310
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:45,140
I was like, thinking, like, recalling all the times

2311
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,500
you had mentioned him, and I was just like, no, he doesn't die.

2312
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,180
You know, he's been, he said brother.

2313
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,740
How did we get two of these in a row?

2314
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,300
You asked for this?

2315
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,780
You never said Kamina, Mr. Best Man.

2316
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:55,780
What the fuck is the point of this?

2317
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:58,940
So I paused it, and I scrolled through the thumbnails,

2318
01:36:58,940 --> 01:36:59,740
and I saw him.

2319
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:02,700
Episode 16, I saw the thumbnail, had Kamina in it.

2320
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,740
That's a flashback episode, you dumbass.

2321
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,900
Whoa.

2322
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,380
All right.

2323
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,900
I had shipped him with Yoko.

2324
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,020
I was just thinking they're going to have such cute kids,

2325
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:13,580
but it wasn't true.

2326
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,820
He did die.

2327
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,580
You know, it is a bit of a sin.

2328
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,940
I should do that, Mr. Best Man.

2329
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,340
I think you should make a rule.

2330
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,220
OK, OK, that's enough.

2331
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,180
I heard that before he stopped.

2332
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,500
This is me off.

2333
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,260
Naheads are fucking banned.

2334
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,540
If you're in Nahead, I'm going to fucking ban you from the PCG.

2335
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:29,860
That's just someone who's really invested in current law.

2336
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:31,060
Yes, that's all I got from that.

2337
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:33,460
It fucking drives me insane when you go on my anime list,

2338
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:36,020
because they fucking have a list of,

2339
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:37,980
if the show is on Crunchyroll, they'll

2340
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:41,100
have thumbnails of the episodes.

2341
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,180
And the first one that appears will always

2342
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:45,500
be whatever is the last or latest episode.

2343
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,260
So if you see a thumbnail with the characters,

2344
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,540
fucking Crunchyroll just auto-selects a face

2345
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,220
from early in the episode.

2346
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,900
So if you see a face on episode 12 when you go to Mal,

2347
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,060
you immediately know that character is not dead.

2348
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,660
I mean, obviously, it could fuck with you,

2349
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,820
like this case and this voicemail.

2350
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,980
But I'm always, I'm just like, what the fuck?

2351
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,780
You literally have spoilers right on the page

2352
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:10,340
where you tell me about the show at all.

2353
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:12,020
I mean, it's kind of weird.

2354
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,140
It's like you want to balance not spoiling people,

2355
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,140
but I guess they just want to get a little snapshot

2356
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,980
of the content of the episode as a preview.

2357
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,100
But yeah, it's just like, this character is definitely

2358
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,540
not dying by this episode.

2359
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,540
So rest assured.

2360
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,820
What's that one show that you talked about

2361
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,940
where there's a character who you think isn't,

2362
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,500
the twist is going to be they're not dead, but you see them.

2363
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,300
But it was like a hallucination or something.

2364
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,420
It was like a hologram.

2365
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:39,820
I don't know, you did your, I want to fucking video on it.

2366
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:40,900
You know what, who cares?

2367
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:41,900
Doesn't matter.

2368
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,700
Are we talking about Steins Gate Zero?

2369
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,700
No, it was like, what's the one with the kids

2370
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,980
and like the post-apocalypse, and they're all

2371
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,380
sci-fi or something.

2372
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,300
I don't fucking remember.

2373
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,140
Okay, whatever.

2374
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,700
Sci-fi.

2375
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,260
I mean, don't they have like psychic powers or something?

2376
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:03,060
You know what, who literally cares?

2377
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,780
Shinsekai Yuri?

2378
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,140
I think that's what I'm trying to think of.

2379
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,460
Wasn't there like a guy who died?

2380
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,300
Oh, yeah.

2381
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,180
No, it's that he dies.

2382
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,700
And then like through the whole show,

2383
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:16,820
this girl like thinks that he is still out there.

2384
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:20,460
And then in like one of the last episodes at the very end,

2385
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:23,820
like she emerges from this dark cave and the guy is there

2386
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:27,100
and he's all grown up like he would be

2387
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,860
cause he had died when he was younger.

2388
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,620
And then it just straight up at the start of the next episode

2389
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,860
turns out she was just seeing shit.

2390
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,180
Oh my God.

2391
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,620
It was just a different character

2392
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,420
and she was just seeing shit.

2393
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,500
And it was totally meaningless.

2394
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,340
That's fucked up.

2395
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,140
So fucking annoying.

2396
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,340
And people defend that show.

2397
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,540
People call that show a 10 out of 10.

2398
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,620
Maybe other parts are good.

2399
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,980
I don't fucking know.

2400
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,820
Not being impressed.

2401
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:51,780
Fucking terrible.

2402
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,620
Okay. All right.

2403
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,620
Next call.

2404
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:56,420
This one is hashtag bring back to Voo.

2405
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,620
Let's see what he has to say.

2406
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,540
This is what I was saying.

2407
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,060
This is what I was saying before we started.

2408
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:00,900
Gotta bring back to Voo.

2409
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,740
People crazy.

2410
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,660
The official scarcity of the Voo.

2411
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:08,660
I remember every episode will have like one mention of them,

2412
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:12,580
but only for like a second.

2413
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,500
And then no one talks about him ever again.

2414
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,660
I just listened to some of the older episodes

2415
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:20,020
of the podcast with the Voo on it.

2416
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:23,580
And I listened to it with my mom and they were fantastic.

2417
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:26,020
I have not enjoyed a podcast for 10 years.

2418
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,140
It was a period of sex one with your mom.

2419
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:30,740
I finally did because of the power of the Voo.

2420
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:34,580
And we barely get any Voo content.

2421
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:37,260
He's kind of like a limited edition thing.

2422
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,940
Why is this?

2423
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,900
Why do all podcast members have to be

2424
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,140
Wait, hang on.

2425
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:47,180
Flaky, floppy, gloopy, basically hardened air

2426
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,220
like all PCP members are.

2427
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:52,460
And we enjoy the Voo.

2428
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:56,060
Why is the only Voo content we get a video game?

2429
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:57,060
I can't do anything with it.

2430
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:57,900
What's wrong with that?

2431
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:58,740
I can do it.

2432
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,780
It's just late.

2433
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:03,620
You can't do what are you supposed to do with a video game?

2434
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,980
I'm usually in favor of capitalism.

2435
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:10,980
But if it takes a couple of government interventions,

2436
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:15,380
national policies, higher tax rates,

2437
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:20,180
utilitarianism, whatever it takes for Voo to come back

2438
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,460
on the show, let's do it.

2439
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,300
Big problem.

2440
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,980
The problem here is that you're barking up the wrong tree.

2441
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,500
Like you're asking us why isn't Voo on the show?

2442
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,540
None of us knows.

2443
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,340
He can come back anytime, any day.

2444
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:34,180
Yeah, literally Voo just doesn't.

2445
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:36,780
I mean, he seems to be very adamant about not wanting

2446
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,020
to have a public persona.

2447
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:38,860
So there's that.

2448
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,100
He just fucked off somewhere.

2449
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,420
Because he wanted to.

2450
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:45,180
I suppose, because I didn't think about this point till now,

2451
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,380
but I suppose this whole not wanting to have a public persona

2452
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,460
might just mean he does not want to be on podcasts.

2453
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,700
I mean, especially ours anymore.

2454
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,540
I don't know.

2455
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,700
I mean, it would seem so.

2456
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,020
Yeah, I don't know.

2457
01:41:55,020 --> 01:42:00,020
I do know that he's, go on, get it, go on.

2458
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,700
I do know that he has explained a little bit

2459
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,100
about what's going on on his Patreon, if you patronize.

2460
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,940
Oh, really?

2461
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,780
Oh, okay.

2462
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:08,860
Well, mostly just that he's working on stuff

2463
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,420
and that the Patreon is active again.

2464
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,260
That's pretty much it.

2465
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:14,060
It's not that we like pick every episode

2466
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,300
of who's going to be on.

2467
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,460
It's whoever wants to be on.

2468
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,060
It's just whoever shows up.

2469
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:22,060
Like, listen, we want Voo here as much as you do.

2470
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,780
We all want more to Voo.

2471
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:25,020
It's not up to us.

2472
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:25,980
We can't do it.

2473
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,540
We, he's gonna come to us.

2474
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:31,700
If you got, like, I would encourage if you want

2475
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,020
to know what's going on with Voo, talk to Voo.

2476
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:37,260
Do not, like, Voo really does not like

2477
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:39,140
when other people speak for him.

2478
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:42,740
So, like, I would, I don't want to even speculate

2479
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,180
about what's, because I don't really know.

2480
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,260
I don't know what the hell is going on with him,

2481
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,820
because he barely talks about anything

2482
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,980
other than editing my videos.

2483
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,580
He's not even in the chat.

2484
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,500
He left the PCP chat.

2485
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,340
He's not even on.

2486
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,180
He did that ages ago.

2487
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:55,020
Let's not be hyperbolic.

2488
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:55,980
He's done that before.

2489
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,260
He could come back anytime.

2490
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,740
No, yeah, he can come back anytime.

2491
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,060
Just saying, if you guys want to know

2492
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,140
what's going on with Voo, ask to Voo.

2493
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:02,980
Don't ask us.

2494
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:04,940
I was just gonna say, I see Voo in the chat,

2495
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:06,580
but I realize that's just Victor.

2496
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:11,340
Yeah, yeah, I changed Victor's name and role to be Voo.

2497
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,020
It was, we were talking about this right before this.

2498
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,260
Wait, so never mind.

2499
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,380
I guess we've got a new Voo.

2500
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,220
It's okay, guys.

2501
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,060
We've replaced Voo.

2502
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:17,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2503
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:18,740
It's all good.

2504
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,580
It's all good.

2505
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:20,900
We built a better Voo.

2506
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,180
If only Victor ever came online on Discord,

2507
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:24,660
even one single fucking time.

2508
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:27,940
I don't think Victor even has Discord, like, on his computer.

2509
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,700
Probably, yeah, probably not.

2510
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,540
So he's just like this?

2511
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:31,380
Can't read.

2512
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,500
To us, and essentially.

2513
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,060
Yeah.

2514
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,300
He's just as much of a limited-edition

2515
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,340
artificial scarcity boy.

2516
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,620
Even more so, even more so.

2517
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,900
But yeah, fair enough.

2518
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,740
Anytime, people, and don't bug him,

2519
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:44,820
don't harass him or anything,

2520
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,860
but I don't know, if you want him to come back,

2521
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:49,060
you could inform him in a polite and respectful way.

2522
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,740
I mean, he's on Twitter.

2523
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:53,060
You know, there are ways to contact him.

2524
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,540
I don't know if he's still doing that thing

2525
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,140
that he had before, though,

2526
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:59,420
where his Twitter, because he had adblocked everything

2527
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:02,460
that wasn't the text entry form,

2528
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,940
so that he doesn't see any Twitter except for,

2529
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,620
I don't know if he's still doing that, though,

2530
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:09,100
but for a while, he had it so that if he opened Twitter,

2531
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,260
it was just a type your tweet

2532
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,300
and then a submit button and nothing else.

2533
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:15,220
So he can't even see the response to it or anything?

2534
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,060
No, nothing.

2535
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:16,900
Oh, that's interesting.

2536
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,340
I don't know if he's still doing that, though.

2537
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,860
I copied him for a while.

2538
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,580
Dude, I, oh God, what was it?

2539
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,500
I talked to Oolulilia,

2540
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:28,140
and he told me that he has software,

2541
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,420
he's done something to his computer

2542
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:32,340
at the operating system level

2543
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,420
that doesn't let him see certain website,

2544
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:41,420
doesn't let him see anything that Google owns,

2545
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,740
including YouTube.

2546
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,260
So it was like a robot.

2547
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:50,260
He had much of the internet just blocked from his view.

2548
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,780
He's still on Facebook, though.

2549
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:54,940
He's doing that.

2550
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:56,980
Even this is his data.

2551
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:59,660
Such lengths to avoid a certain company

2552
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,380
for various reasons, I don't know,

2553
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,300
but then Facebook's totally okay.

2554
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,100
Well, I mean, it's monopolized, dude.

2555
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,060
It's either one or the other,

2556
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,220
or you're a fucking in no man's land, basically.

2557
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,060
Yeah, I guess.

2558
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,340
Space exists.

2559
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,140
Yeah, fair.

2560
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:16,220
Did you hear that MySpace just lost eight years of posts

2561
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,540
or whatever?

2562
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:18,380
Everybody's, what?

2563
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:22,500
It's lost, like somebody spilled some fucking bang

2564
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,180
on the hard drive, and it all exploded.

2565
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:26,820
They really banged up that hard drive, and, yeah.

2566
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,220
That big bang is just control.

2567
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,060
It's control.

2568
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:31,460
No, do we have any more voicemails?

2569
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,820
All right, we've got a couple more.

2570
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:33,900
Let's go through.

2571
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,940
Okay, next one is, oh, this is a good one.

2572
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:38,420
It's Ben St. Killed My Grandma.

2573
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, but before we play,

2574
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:43,180
I just wanna say for the past three months,

2575
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:45,140
for the entire voicemail section,

2576
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:48,580
I have been on the YouTube homepage,

2577
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:53,580
just like watching shitty fucking terrible

2578
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,700
new Western animation like teaser trailers

2579
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:59,980
without the sound on, and trying to match

2580
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:04,980
your guys' voice to shit, ah, Western animation characters.

2581
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:08,060
So right now, right now I am the bunny

2582
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:10,460
from the Secret Life of Pets 2,

2583
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,740
being really angry on screen right now.

2584
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,100
I highly recommend this experience.

2585
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,820
Please give us a screen cap or something.

2586
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:17,760
Secret Life of Pets sounds like the most

2587
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,820
human core fucking show I've ever heard of.

2588
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,500
But isn't it Animal Core though, because it's pets?

2589
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,020
Liking animals is human.

2590
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,300
Okay, I guess that's fair.

2591
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,260
Okay, let's move on.

2592
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:28,620
Ben St. Killed My Grandma, and I wanna hear about it.

2593
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:29,460
Yeah.

2594
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,540
Let's go.

2595
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:34,780
Oop.

2596
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:39,020
Commencing audio playback.

2597
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:43,260
Classified information moving in three, two, one.

2598
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:46,460
Guys, listen to me, I don't have much time.

2599
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:49,100
I'm from the future, the year 2021.

2600
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:52,980
In the year 2020, the PCP falls apart.

2601
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,060
When them snakes, the guy who dropped that awesome track,

2602
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:59,220
he buys Ben's kidney stone, reverse-engineers it,

2603
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:04,100
and creates an army of Ben snakes, it's Armageddon.

2604
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:09,100
Ben rises in power, he's playing so much Garfield Go,

2605
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:12,660
that now he declares every day Monday for the populace,

2606
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,460
only he gets to experience Fridays.

2607
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,340
Every other day's Monday falls.

2608
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,980
He controls everything.

2609
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,060
The stores only sell keto food.

2610
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,660
It's, I can't do this, or you don't think it affects

2611
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:24,780
the PCP, you think I'm being overdramatic?

2612
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,500
Listen to this.

2613
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:30,300
As the inheritor, as the new inheritor of title

2614
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,060
of PCP dictator, what?

2615
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:35,980
Just like to say, best guy, we wish you well

2616
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:36,820
in your future.

2617
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:37,660
What is this?

2618
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,460
And our attorneys will be contacting you soon

2619
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,100
and we'll see you in court, you motherfucker.

2620
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:44,940
Ben.

2621
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,620
I remember, yeah, that sounds like something

2622
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,460
I would say in the future.

2623
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:48,660
In the future, yeah.

2624
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:51,540
You have to drag me out of my gold-plated office

2625
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:53,100
by my dead fucking claws.

2626
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:56,700
When them snakes clones my kidney stone

2627
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,060
and turns it into an army of Ben Saints, guess what?

2628
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:00,380
We're all voting for Yang.

2629
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:02,100
We're all gonna be Yang gang.

2630
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,260
I guess, fair enough.

2631
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,460
So you have complete domination over the world,

2632
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,820
but you're still voting.

2633
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,140
Yeah, that's right.

2634
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:11,460
Well, Yang gang wants Yang gang for life.

2635
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,180
That's really all there is to it, so.

2636
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:16,020
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's incremental steps.

2637
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,460
2020, Ben St, the Ben St collective,

2638
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,300
elects Yang.

2639
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,420
2021, we are Yang.

2640
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:25,340
We replaced him.

2641
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,260
All right, let's move along here.

2642
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,580
That's a terrifying thought,

2643
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:32,620
but next up is hipster Cthulhu calling in again.

2644
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,700
The future's looking bright, boys.

2645
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:37,460
All right, Cthulhu, lay it on us.

2646
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,820
Hey, PCP, you know, it's a bit windy outside.

2647
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,660
Let me just open the window.

2648
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:42,500
Oh, okay.

2649
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:49,180
That's it.

2650
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,140
That's the entire podcast call.

2651
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,900
Yeah, this is pretty good.

2652
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:53,740
I feel refreshed.

2653
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,140
I feel, yeah, it was nice.

2654
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:55,980
It was cooling.

2655
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,460
Oh, okay, you know what?

2656
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:02,940
So last time I said, we got a call from a podcast

2657
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:04,700
in the middle of someone else's podcast.

2658
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,780
That one was shit, but this one's a little bit better.

2659
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,700
So let's hear what he has to say.

2660
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:09,820
Hello, and welcome back to the podcast

2661
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,500
that takes place in the middle of someone else's podcast.

2662
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,540
Today's theme of this podcast is the crushing

2663
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:17,380
existential dread you feel

2664
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,020
when the members of the podcast,

2665
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,660
you are trying to have your respectable podcast

2666
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:24,340
in the middle of don't deem you worthy,

2667
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:29,340
but still have the gall to mention the fact that you exist.

2668
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,460
So it's not just like they just missed over you,

2669
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,660
but it's like they noticed you were there,

2670
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,060
but you were just not good enough.

2671
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:39,780
And you know, in a way that is crushing and soul destroying,

2672
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,260
but another way it pushes you to make better content.

2673
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,260
So that's the end of this podcast.

2674
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,100
Thanks for listening.

2675
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,860
I'll give you an example of that, I'm guessing.

2676
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:50,500
Who sent that one?

2677
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,980
His name is simply podcast

2678
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,620
in the middle of someone else's podcast.

2679
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,340
That's all I know.

2680
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:57,380
He sounded a little bit like no thank you.

2681
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,580
Maybe it's him.

2682
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:01,700
It's a mystery to everybody.

2683
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,300
Well, maybe we'll see improved content for him coming up.

2684
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,700
Okay, moving on.

2685
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:09,980
Something about black people with British accents.

2686
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:10,820
Yeah.

2687
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,660
What a, it's so, it's so.

2688
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:13,820
Oh, do you think that was a black guy?

2689
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:15,380
Did it, I thought so.

2690
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:18,220
That'd be my guess if I had to guess.

2691
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,060
I didn't.

2692
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:19,900
Who knows?

2693
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:21,940
Ben confirmed racist.

2694
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:23,180
Okay, moving on.

2695
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:24,020
That's right.

2696
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:27,620
We've got LPCP roll call, Scorcho.

2697
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,820
That's his full name.

2698
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:30,460
Okay, go.

2699
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,300
Ooh.

2700
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:36,900
I think it's time for a bit of a roll call.

2701
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,740
It's a weasel.

2702
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:38,580
Starting with the DeFu.

2703
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:39,420
Yeah.

2704
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:44,420
And Tom Oliver nades the best guy in the world.

2705
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,060
Yeah.

2706
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:50,660
She wears tiny hats.

2707
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:51,500
Yes.

2708
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:56,260
And let's jazz and hypocrite.

2709
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:01,260
We thought we'd be defencings.

2710
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:04,620
Hopefully they didn't miss anyone.

2711
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:06,140
Yeah, I think that was everybody.

2712
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:09,980
I feel very denigrated.

2713
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:11,540
I just mentioned my name.

2714
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,660
I didn't even get a blurb.

2715
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:13,500
Yeah, that's true.

2716
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,820
I mean, Digi didn't even get mentioned, right?

2717
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:16,660
Oh, did I?

2718
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,500
No.

2719
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,340
I'm pretty sure you just skip it.

2720
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:19,180
Wasn't he at the very beginning

2721
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,980
right before he started saying, or did I miss it?

2722
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:22,820
Oh, okay.

2723
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:23,660
No, it was DeVu and Tom.

2724
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:25,140
Yeah, DeVu and Tom, lol.

2725
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:26,340
Oh, wait, did he miss anybody else?

2726
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,540
I think it was just Digi, right?

2727
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:31,780
Well, I think that is lay joke, but okay, moving on.

2728
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,620
Okay.

2729
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:35,180
Hey, whoever's editing this episode,

2730
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,900
are we gonna use, remember last episode,

2731
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:39,020
someone had a song that we all said,

2732
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:42,060
like, oh, this should be the intro song this episode?

2733
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,260
Don't remember, but I believe.

2734
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,740
One of the voicemails last was just a funny song

2735
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:47,780
about the podcast, and we were all like,

2736
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:49,460
that should be next episode's intro.

2737
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,220
Okay, someone should, we should check this out.

2738

2739
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,060
Okay, next call.

2740
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,540
This is from Mozilla Fennecann, writing it again.

2741
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,380
Oh, yeah.

2742
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,220
Go.

2743
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:01,580
Hey, you argued about interrupting effects

2744
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:04,140
of podcast or whatever, and as a long-time fan

2745
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,980
and podcaster myself, I wanna give my thoughts.

2746
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:07,980
I think that interrupting-

2747
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,420
Okay, hold on a second.

2748
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:10,260
I wanna say something.

2749
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,140
I think that interrupting is always bad.

2750
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:13,900
I wouldn't ever do it.

2751
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,520
I'm really enjoying, it's really hard to listen to.

2752
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:17,580
It's so weird.

2753
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:19,480
I'm just like a bunch of baby chicks.

2754
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:41,220
It's so wrapped in tape

2755
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:44,940
Indeed case point proven interrupting is the best

2756
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:53,980
Wait that wasn't megalovania that was um that was like

2757
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:05,100
I thought it was like a heavy metal remix of the Star Wars cantina

2758
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,100
It's not a meme

2759
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:16,580
It is a meme they're both way bigger meme than megalovania is actually about that dude. I don't know mash up mash up

2760
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:21,020
Yeah, but somebody please mix that okay sound off in the comments. What fucking song was it?

2763
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:34,760
St. Patrick chased all the snakes from Ireland

2768
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,640
Like if you look at like a Welsh

2769
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:07,080
Like road signs there are some like extremely long and impossible to pronounce roads play like names

2770
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,160
There's a video of a weatherman like a Welsh weatherman like pronounce

2771
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:17,640
He's he says like the weather in and then he proceeds to pronounce a like 50 letter long

2772
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,200
Name that makes you know fucking sit but he says the whole thing and it's like an entire sentence of a word

2773
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:27,680
And he just says it perfectly and he seems a little bit just a little bit satisfied with himself that he got through

2774
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,400
Without without fucking it up. I'm proud of him. He did a good job

2775
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:36,620
Well, you made an enemy for life of the Welsh people munchie. That's your bad line. I couldn't be happier

2776
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:42,800
Okay, moving on. Oh, we've got okay returning hero riddle my ass Batman is calling it again

2795
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:17,600
Thinks it's like a like a former Chinese warlord or something or like some kind of sound like that

2796
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,920
Makes me think of waiting for

2797
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:25,520
Love you love your stuff. That wasn't our brittle though. That would that just was like

2798
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:30,680
So it's Nate Nate is green and it has sunglasses

2799
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:34,680
Okay, just because the riddle was pretty much the same as mine

2800
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,960
Yeah, just because the answer was relatively easy to decipher. It doesn't mean it was not a riddle

2801
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:43,280
It was just you know riddle for babies. My mind was just like who does

2802
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:47,240
Credit where credit is due in rhyming. This is a hilarious fucking premise

2803
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:52,280
It's not that he was able to decipher what each line meant. He figured out that BGE started the sentences

2804
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:56,200
This is comedy. Monty. Do you understand comedy and jokes?

2805
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
Riddle my ass Batman

2806
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,720
Another soul laid

We've got one more actual voicemail from concerned citizen of America. Okay go

2811
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:41,400
Same you know a lot of the times you guys would say stuff like this isn't an anime podcast

2812
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:49,040
And this isn't a podcast where we talk about anime you losers stop asking about it, but considering I also didn't assume it was a

2813
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:54,320
podcast about politics and you seem to talk a shit ton about that I

2814
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:59,800
Think it's only fair that we finally get the answer to the age-old question

2815
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,160
Favorite anime

2816
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:19,520
Let's say our favorite anime is wait, but I don't I don't want you better think real fast you

01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
three

2818
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:29,320
Popey the performer. I think it's good enough. Yeah, I think he speaks for all of us when he says poppy the performer

2819
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,320
Leafy ahead into the wild

2820
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:41,280
Nate are you also talking about Shinsekai yori again

2821
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,720
Let's just put it down put me down for Shinsekai yori everybody that sounds good

01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:54,080
All right film yeah, but oh but only the sub not the

2823
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,720
Leafy that leafy ahead into the wild is a Korean animated not even anime

2824
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:08,680
It's about a hen who adopts a duck

2825
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,560
It's about a hen who adopts a duck kind of and raises it as her son

2826
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,480
It's a heartwarming film and it's really good

2827
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:27,080
It's so good. It's all right. I'm sold. I don't know about you moving on mate maids mate maids

2830
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:46,000
Yeah, that was that was the last one we're all done people so thanks for listening everybody

2831
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,040
This has been another episode of the procrastinators podcast patreon.com slash

01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:56,800
Procrastinators, right? Yes. Okay. Thank you. I always I don't know why

2833
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:06,640
Five dollars bonus episodes. We just recorded a new one people

02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,720
Should we say should we say

2835
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:16,680
It'll come out one two. No, it'll come out three days after this episode comes out

2836
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,320
So we'll let you speculate. We'll tell you after it comes out

2837
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:24,840
So give us you know what will do you know what will be out by the time you're listening to it will not be up by the

2838
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:31,400
Time they listen. No, no, I'm asking. Do you know what will be? Oh by the time you know supposedly no, I don't the real the real

2839
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:33,800
PCP dating Sam

2840
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,640
Yeah, that's right, of course

2841
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:43,120
But not the not the original one, which will be out two days on from now from when you're listening to this on April 1st

2842
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,440
But the other one supposedly will be out

2843
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,440
Gonna be a demo I

2844
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:57,400
Think that's it is a demo. Yeah, that's that's right. You know a voicemail by the way go on much. Go ahead

2845
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:01,040
Well, I just want to say that I don't believe you

2846
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:03,640
That's the thing. We'll have to see

2847
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:07,680
I've doubted this project from the beginning April 1st, right April 1st

2848
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:11,560
Hmm that day has no larger significance than I'm aware of so that should be fine

2849
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,880
They seem they seem I mean despite the day

2850
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:23,160
They have been on record at saying that the best kind of surprises on April fools are actual things that you think are bullshit

2851
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,880
But turn out to actually be real and cool and dope

2852
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:33,080
So maybe you know, I will reserve judgment. I will reserve judgment. How exciting first how exciting anyway

2853
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:36,320
Follow those guys. Well, go go check out if it's out by the time you're hearing this, I guess

2854
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:43,240
Interesting that's that's at PCP dating sim and at PCP dating are the two competing, you know

2855
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:48,560
We got a voicemail from somebody it was something essentially like he made like a in one minute

2856
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:54,400
He made a PCP dating sim that was like a Google text thing you could type into it wasn't I think was a joke though

2857
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:57,240
So I didn't you know what it sounds while we're doing our promos

2858
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:01,400
I just felt the need to say if you're listening to this podcast

2859
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,760
And you need more content in your life

2860
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:11,960
Subscribe to everybody on the podcast and watch all their videos. I

2861
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:19,920
Don't know it's it's it's weird because I know there's people who listen to PCP who only like actually follow a couple of us

2862
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,400
Or maybe just one or somebody. Yeah, yeah

2863
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,580
The conceit of this podcast is a bunch of people who make good videos

2864
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:33,140
So go watch them all make good stuff. Yeah, I well, you know

2865
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:38,460
We'll say good content

2866
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:42,860
Everybody in the group makes good content, so go follow the rest of their content

2867
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:51,300
Because I just I just hear every once in a while people who are like

2868
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:57,340
Oh, I don't know anything about X member of the PCP and I'm like why why do you not know anything about any

2869
02:02:57,340 --> 02:03:01,700
Member if you're a fan of one of us, why would you you would like all of our content?

2870
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,500
It's all the same kind of shit

2871
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:10,740
There are always there are all every episode there are links to our YouTube channels in the description

2872
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:15,300
Everyone who's on that episode and from our YouTube channels, you know, there are links up in the top

2873
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:19,180
We've got we've got our other social media and other platforms and stuff linked

2874
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:26,140
Mine always links to my web that's right. You're right. Yeah, stuff. Um, yeah, like

2875
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:32,620
Did few like weeks ago now I that video I just made about me talking about what I do

2876
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:35,540
Ended up with a lot of people

2877
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:42,420
Learning about me and like I got contacted about something special and secret and it's cool

2878
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:47,220
Do you mean the hippo talks for minutes video? Yeah, hippo crit talks for minutes. Yeah, sometimes

2879
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:53,680
Focus on basically marketing yourself can go a long way a very long way

2880
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:58,140
My reputation for patreon.com

2881
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:02,940
Slash been saying I had never say it anymore and it's been to my detriment indeed indeed

2882
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:07,580
It was this essential me a foundational meme really. So I'm no so any any

2883
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:13,900
Ben say also read my any marketing campaign eventually starts to ring hollow to people when they hear it too much

2884
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:17,780
It was got to be re-entering. Yeah platform. I couldn't strike the right balance

2885
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:22,740
I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't just keep ramming that down people's throats forever. I had to find a new tactic

2886
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:24,740
So instead I just stopped

2887
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:30,760
Why is this always? Okay, that's it everybody. Thanks for listening

2888
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,300
Oh, we can follow us of course at TP craftnators
