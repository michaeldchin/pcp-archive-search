00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello, welcome to the show. We're here to let you know.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Time is running out, there's something running out. Remember that song from that movie?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, couldn't possibly in any way.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the pony movie.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What? There was a song?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the pony, it was the two, yeah, the one with the rock band.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
With the sirens.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The only thing I can remember is that one Aladdin scene because it was so out of place with the cat.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What? No, no, no, not that pony movie. I'm talking about the Equestria Girls. Equestria Girls, two rainbow rocks.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, yeah, that's sad. Why do you remember any of that?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, you're wrong. That's the only Equestria Girl that's kind of good. That one's kind of okay sometimes.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The other ones are terrible.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was mediocre. It was like, this is not enough classic rock for me.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They got guitars, but where's the solos at? Where's the Jimmy Page shit?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That one has its moments. That one has its moments.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Moments of pure devastation on the part of the viewer.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I mean when you're right, you're right.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So how's your week been, Gib? What's been going on over there across the pond?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's been fine.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, wait, well, there's a news thing.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't really want to, I mean, it's like a thing happened.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh my God.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's just that I have an opinion on it, but it's kind of a stupid like making it about me opinion.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But there was this lady who got murdered by a policeman or something.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Or like the police didn't help or it was like it was really tragic or something.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't look into it too much, but I did see that there was like a memorial service.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The vigil.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The vigil.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And the police came to that and they pushed everyone around and said,

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
get the fuck out of here, you're not allowed.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And it's like, I guess they're not allowed. It's true, but it didn't look good.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Super bad.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And there was a lot of stuff on BBC.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I was just like checking BBC every so often just because whatever.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't get British news from American pundits.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I just have to check myself.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there was a lot of women talking about how they are mistreated and they're not listened to

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and that men are evil and well, not evil.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They didn't say that.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And there was all that stuff going on.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And the only thing I could think of, I mean, obviously there's always like a problem with misogyny and stuff.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But the only thing I can think of is that that could so easily turn into hardcore turf bigotry.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I was just thinking about...

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Everyone in England is a turf, Gib.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I know.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All of your people are like that.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm like, true.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Women, they don't feel safe to walk the streets at night.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's some parts of London that are very dangerous and it's not good.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But at the same time, I could so easily see like if I spoke out or if I was involved in any way that I would be potentially sort of attacked or like...

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You wouldn't be taken seriously.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I would be...

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Like, I don't know.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I mean, there was nothing in the news that indicated that like trans issues was any part of the discussion.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I'm just wary of it now because I'm just...

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's so obvious in other parts how transphobic the UK is.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ah, just pissed me off.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It didn't piss me off.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It just made me a little, ah, jeez.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ah, jeez.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ah, jeez, Rick.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, ah, jeez, Rick.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're saying we got to take a whole 23-minute episode, go to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and kill JK Rowling.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ah, jeez.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
God, they should do that.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They might do that.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They might...

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They were making a fucking...

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They made a Gamergate reference in the last season.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was really like late on that issue.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I could see them saying turf.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I could see Rick saying turf.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Like, you know what Morty, it's cool to be hating turfs.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I know how influential I am because of Pickle Rick Morty.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to teach the kids how to kill the turfs.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ah, fuck.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Guaranteed plotline.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can't wait.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It just rolls...

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, it's just such a natural...

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's just a natural thing.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Rick is just so interested in social justice and in making people's lives better.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He won't let any injustice stand.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And he's probably just...

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think he would probably just wipe Great Britain off the map.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think it would probably be the simplest solution.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then everyone would be happy.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No losers.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, okay.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That brings me a little bit to...

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Some people in my Discord were talking a little about the Kiwi Farms thread.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
About the Trixie thread on Kiwi Farms.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I read some of it.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I...

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There were a couple funny things about it that were worth noting.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But there was one post in particular that made me lull so hard.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let me... hold on.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think I...

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, I have a screenshot.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, like, the context is that all the Kiwi Farms people, a lot of them are like,

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, fuck Trixie.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Fuck the PCP.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But Nate, though.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, but that Nate guy, though, he's kind of like a trad chat.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'm like, I have daddy issues and I will latch on to anyone as a role model.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, like, hmm, maybe this Nate guy's all right.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want to, like, put that on Nate.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not Nate's fault that these people are idiots.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But this...

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to read this out loud because this is so fucking funny.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
On a side note, I hope Kantent dies soon.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let Nate go.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He's a meme lord, but will never ever trune out or even joke about doing so.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He thinks buff males are peak aesthetic for men and likes women with fat tits unironically.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Guy is straight as a board.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wait.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What does trune out mean?

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's straight.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's kind of a slur at all.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Nominally.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In theory, in theory, a trune is a fake trans person who's just doing it for attention.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But in practice, every trans person is a trune to these pig fuckers.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So, I just love the like...

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What sort of person is like...

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nate will never go trans.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Nate will never go trans.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's straight.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's fucking straight.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What a strange thing to say.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is my favorite.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is like copy pasta worthy.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dude, unironically likes fat tits.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bruh.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's just like me.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's just like me.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know, that argument doesn't even make sense.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because if he were trans, he could still like men and women with fat tits unironically.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That could still be true.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But like this person doesn't fucking understand anything.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Such a strange reason for content to die is that Nate is not trans.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't believe how straight he is.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Trixie is too much of a bad influence.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Too much of a degenerate influence on Nate.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like the two of them are like oil and water.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like they must naturally repel from one another.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
For them to have a show together is like a violation of the natural hierarchy.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, is that why they're saying it?

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, I think this person just has distaste at seeing the two of them together.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I see.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because they respect one and hate the other.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think that's the point.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's more what I would have expected from...

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
At first I was thinking, why the fuck is Nate here?

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Get the fuck rid of Nate.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's not trans enough.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's too straight.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I hate looking at Nate.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That doesn't make any sense.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not it.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's not it.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's not it.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I like the part when he says he will never trun out or even joke about doing so.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is this guy...

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I just wonder what this guy is gonna...

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What is the cop gonna be when the OVA comes out?

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Lol.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, no.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He would never even joke.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He would never even joke about being a girl.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's just how straight he is.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And unironically, this is like pre-transition Chris Chan being like, I'm straight.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have a subscription to Playboy.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's the feeling here.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But it's not even about himself.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's about someone else.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I love this.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is the new meme.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Insane.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Guy is straight.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He thinks buff males are peak aesthetic for men and likes women with fat tits unironically.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Guy is a straight...

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Guy is a straight as a board.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's a jewel.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's a jewel I had to...

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I just had to share it.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, that's over.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What next?

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, Bitcoin.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, no.

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bitcoin.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's going to the moon.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I guess it's a good thing, but it's like the continuing arc of like, oh, did you know

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
coin went up or down?

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, it went up.

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It went up.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It went up past the previous peak.

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's the news.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's the news.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yep.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's up.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It is at...

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It is at...

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It is just over 60K.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It went up to almost 62K.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's down a little bit, but like it's still up overall.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I am waiting for it to hit 64K.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If it hits 64K, I will have recouped everything that I lost from GameStop.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So that would be...

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That would be very nice.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's what I'm hoping it happens.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Also, I'm still waiting for...

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was kind of expecting it to jump when people started getting stimmy checks.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I haven't really seen that happening.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I know some people are saying they're getting their stimmy, but it's not...

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know if like most people have gotten it yet.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So I'm still waiting to see if there's a jump.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, about like the...

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I mean, obviously, I don't know nothing.

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't even know why I started speaking, but like there's a lot of big...

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There's a lot of big investments from big business people being like,

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
oh, Bitcoin is good and they're pumping money into it.

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So I think that's what's causing this spike rather than like individuals getting into it.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's a whole lot of like, oh, we've got to make sure it doesn't crash.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Keep fucking putting money in it or something.

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Maybe you're right.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean, I'm looking at it and like early on the 13th, there was like one...

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like couple of minutes there where it just like shot up like crazy.

244
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And like, yeah, that has to be some like big company being like,

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
time to dump all our assets into Bitcoin.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Got a dumb pass on this Bitcoin.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A dumb pass on Bitcoin.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We've waited far too long.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The investors are clamoring for those Bitcoin gains.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, they'll get them in the short term anyway.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I do think it's going to crash again.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I just don't know when.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, whatever.

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But great segue, great segue to Psycholonials,

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
which also has Bitcoin shenanigans involved.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, it does.

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah, it does.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So you're caught up to Chapter 5 now?

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've caught up to the current Chapter 5 of Psycholonials.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I would say it's great.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's like...

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I love it.

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I love Psycholonials.

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's like the sort of hype that you get from a homestuck with a few flash.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, I guess there wouldn't be flash.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's just like movies, cutscenes, if you will, of stuff happening with music.

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And the writing is cool.

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The characters are really good.

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And it's...

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah.

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They are.

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They're actually good.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How's he actually wrote a thing that's good?

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In fact, put this audio before we talk about spoilers.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Go play Psycholonials.

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's very, very good.

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's a visual novel.

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hussie written.

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Extremely good character development.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Would you believe it?

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone was so skeptical.

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Everyone said, ah, Hussie, he's a washed up old dish rag.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He's never...

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He fucked up with Hive Swap and now he's fucking dead.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Nah.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I was very optimistic.

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was like, oh, this is him.

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is him untethered from any weird corporate shit or monetary expectations of like, oh,

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have to write this thing for Hive Swap.

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, I have to deliver on these Kickstarter expectations.

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He's like, no, that's a separate thing.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is just a thing he felt like making and he made.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And that's what I'm interested in seeing.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it's good.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Zee is really cool.

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She's a literal cop killer and they call her that and she wears purple.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's pretty good.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Very like super Bencore.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
She is super Bencore.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think, do we want to...

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do we care about spoilers or...

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We can talk about spoilers in a little bit.

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I just want to say that the whole Hussie washed up thing.

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't ever think it's been because of his writing.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because like, the epilogue was extremely terrible, but like it was written.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't read it.

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I didn't read it.

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I don't know.

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I didn't read the candy side.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There was the meat and the candy meat.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I read purely so that I could see the finality of what happened with the Lord English battle

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and what happened to John Egbert for real.

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Canon.

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Now I know.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
John's dead.

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's dead.

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And Roxy is trans and various other things that are interesting and good.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But like it's tied to Homestuck and the whole, you know, Homestuck has a lot of baggage with it.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So like, you can't make an epilogue to Homestuck work exactly.

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like you can't make it like satisfy everyone.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So he just made it kind of as unsatisfying and ridiculous and stupid as possible.

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And it was kind of funny in that sense.

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But also I didn't, yeah, it was whatever.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then there was Homestuck too, which is like not really written by him.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And so that's not really a, it's like plot points and various some things are written by him, but not all of it is.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So the only thing I've really seen of his post Homestuck writing wise is his authors notes on the latest like Homestuck books.

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The physical print versions.

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've enjoyed those.

331
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you own those?

332
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I own Act, let me check.

333
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I've got my shelf here.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, I have books four, five and six.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Book five is Act five, Act two, part one.

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Book six is Act five, Act two, part two.

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I don't think it gets to Cascade.

338
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think that would be the next one.

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
All I wanted was like Act five and Cascade.

340
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And Cascade is like still not, it's so much pages, but the author notes are really good.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Very insightful, very good analysis stuff.

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And since it's written like more modern times than his previous book commentary was,

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I get to understand a little bit of what he's going through right at the moment as he's, you know, like after Homestuck is finished and seeing the author notes and like that that's pretty cool.

344
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So I was never under the impression that Hussier has like got bad or shit.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's just that he didn't like Homestuck.

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You didn't want to work on it anymore, but it was sort of like yeah.

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And that's why I was like, oh, this is this thing is not Homestuck.

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Like, yeah, Homestuck had so much baggage.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was like, oh my God, and non Homestuck property.

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like finally, like I've sort of, I've wanted Hussie to stop making Homestuck for a while now and just do something else.

351
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you, did you play Hiveswap?

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I guess there's two Hiveswaps.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know.

354
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh yeah, the second one is out.

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is it?

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think it is.

357
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, I played the first one.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It was all right.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Here it was all right.

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, it was all right.

361
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It was just a point and click like puzzles run that interesting and it was quite short.

362
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm just not that interested in like exploring the like troll culture, which seems like a lot of what Hiveswap is about.

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know if that's accurate.

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's just my impression.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The first part is like half in Joey in the mansion, like the human world.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And it's a mansion that is tied to Jake English grandpa or Jade Harley or something.

367
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's like tied to those characters in some way.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then the troll stuff is like after her Imperius condescension left troll land.

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No, this is before.

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is, I can't think of what the, I think it slots into Homestuck somewhere.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's like before a lot of stuff happened, but it's got a different Empress and it's a different Empress and a bunch of trolls.

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And there they are.

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't know.

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They never gave a shit about any of them.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They had that fucking fucking talking game where you talk to a bunch of troll OCs and you learn about them and I never had any interest in that.

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Nice.

377
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I should probably play it.

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I mean, they're short, right?

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone says they're short.

380
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hiveswap?

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's like not a shit game.

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So, okay.

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The branding on Psycholonials or like the blurbs about Psycholonials that I could read before I started playing it.

386
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They emphasize that it was like about some kids trying to like start like a media brand.

387
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

388
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I feel like it didn't talk about like spoilers, by the way, all like the murder and the cop murder.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I mean, that was a surprise.

390
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I wasn't really expecting it to go away.

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, I wasn't expecting that.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
At the end of chapter one, I'm like, oh, it's that kind of story.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All right.

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's like it starts off because the first Homestuck was like ostensibly.

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Obstensibly, it was a thing.

397
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It was about like four kids and, you know, Homestuck, like they're stuck at home.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like they are not old enough to leave home.

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
They are not old enough to venture on their own.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And it is a coming of age story in a way.

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You're saying that that's what you thought it was?

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, there's lots of like theming of like, I'm trying to like wrap Homestuck up in like one description.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's kind of difficult.

404
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But like, it's about four kids who are kind of young.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
They're like 13 stuff.

406
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And the adventure they go on is in part about growing up and also about the way the internet works.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And the model of, you know, how the comic is portrayed online with GIFs, with Flash, with, you know, HTML is like, and all of the mannerisms of like the trolls are like, it's like a web comic about the web.

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
On the web.

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And it's a comic.

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's like a new thing.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's like an interesting idea that hadn't really been done before.

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And so this, I feel like Psycholonials is like Hussie finding is another interesting way, like the internet has changed.

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And this, you know, the way culture has changed.

414
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Homestuck doesn't really make sense anymore.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It also is broken in a lot of ways.

416
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And you can't exactly experience it the same way.

417
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And like Psycholonials is clearly his, like he's interested in the way that it's changed.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And he's telling a story with that as part of, part of something.

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You know, it's not finished yet.

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I haven't seen it a little bit.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But like, I get the feeling that that's the reason he was interested in this idea is that it takes place in the real world.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
COVID-19, 2020.

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And people are, you know, they're not just human beings.

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They also have brands and everyone's trying to make their brand good.

425
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And these two girls are influencers.

426
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But also this shudder guy.

427
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Hmm. Yeah.

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I mean, do you think Hussie just like wants at all times to be writing a story about what the internet is like?

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, I mean.

430
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is just like the newest iteration of that.

431
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:18,000
No, I think it's just that like maybe to move on from Homestuck, which was that is like deliberately showing that like Homestuck is not that Homestuck is old or whatever.

432
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But like the internet in the way that it's portrayed in Homestuck is very outdated.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And people are different in the way they interact with each other is different social media and all that.

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They just found that interesting.

435
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And also he just wanted to write another clown story because he's been like clowns is like the every single comic has clowns in them.

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Every single one, every single thing he's done has clowns except for maybe that.

437
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, the wrapping.

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Homestuck was like the least clown thing he ever made.

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Well, I guess close.

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's close.

441
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Problem Sleuth has clown like a clown race in it, but they're not that forefront.

442
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They're sort of just a funny little extra thing.

443
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They're just kind of there.

444
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I mean, I mean, Homestuck has like all like the gamsy stuff is like pretty is juggler stuff.

445
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But I mean, he's like one character out of like, you know, 400 or whatever.

446
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, this is like the clowns clowns are back their front and center back with a vengeance.

447
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
His his like his like Instagram posts of like himself in like the E boy clown makeup.

448
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, it was the E boy cast that in like a funny new new life.

449
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He had those the E boy like looking funky fresh out in the world taking pictures doing silly poses in front of stuff and horses.

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And like the the sunglasses with sports on them that Z wears he has those and has taken a picture of those.

451
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I recognize that was like a long now.

452
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

453
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah, that was another thing I was going to say is like it's very clearly a reflection of his.

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You know, experiences being extremely influential creator that has been canceled a few times and it's like a little bit of that mixed in.

455
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
To the story a little, I mean, a little bit, a little bit someone.

456
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Munchie told me that he he hadn't read it yet, but he I asked him if he was gonna and he said that he heard somewhere that someone had like told him that like the story was cringe because it was all about cancel culture and how and how bad cancel culture is.

457
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And I'm like, I don't know who told you that but like that's totally wrong.

458
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No, I guess there's a little bit of that in there.

459
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, it's it's like it's using counts, counts, council, cancel culture, so culture.

460
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's using cancel culture, culture, culture as as like a like a plot point.

461
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You know, it's just a new way that somebody something from your past can come back to haunt you is another is it's a cancel culture is just a modern way of saying that sort of thing happened.

462
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Like you did something fucked up and people remember it and that will haunt you forever.

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, the fact that it's like can cancel you is like the fact that she doesn't really get canceled at all.

464
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Maybe she will in the future, but like that it's it's more of a storytelling device just like a contemporary way of telling a thing happened.

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,000
She she got canceled in the past, but we don't like they allude to something that happened before that made everyone hate her.

466
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, but like they we never find out what that was.

467
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, it's just like it might not even be important.

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's like saying, you know, it's like, oh, this story sucks because it's about a backstory.

469
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And that's all it's about.

470
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's like, well, I mean, backstories exist in all sorts of things.

471
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This one just happens to be cancel culture related.

472
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't really I don't really think it is cancel culture really.

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know.

474
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Well, the whole like the whole everyone hates her now is like it's so vague about like what it's meaning that like I wouldn't call it.

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I wouldn't call it.

476
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I wouldn't really call it anything.

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, yeah.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Who fucking knows what it is.

479
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Not a cancel culture.

480
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's just the words they use.

481
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's what I was getting at.

482
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's like this is a normal thing that happens in a lot of stories.

483
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's just got the words cancel in it and it's like, oh, that's a modern thing.

484
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I guess.

485
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, I guess so.

486
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She I don't know.

487
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't know where the story is going.

488
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean, I can see the where it's at now how like the brand combined like the brand people liked it.

489
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And then the news broke of the cop murder and that was like completely on brand for it and it only like propelled the brand to greater heights.

490
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And then it turned into like this kind of tertiary social movement that sort of piggybacked off the George Floyd stuff.

491
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And now there's like a militia on Nantucket.

492
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That all makes sense to me.

494
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That all seems like a pretty natural progression.

495
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I have no clue.

496
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, like what this is like what the end is going to be.

497
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I I mean, I asked, you know, like the clown God, the Jubilee God.

498
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Is he real?

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Is it real entity or is he just hallucination?

500
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, like, you know, Hussey has had things that seemed real and then didn't be real in like problem sleuth started off as like, oh, it's a like a video game private detective thing.

501
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then it spiraled out of control and something completely insane.

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Homestuck similarly, people will be wondering if this is the same sort of thing.

503
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Is it actually like supernatural or is this just like a psychological manifestation?

504
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I don't know.

505
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It could be.

506
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It could go either way, which is why I'm interested in finding out.

507
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I guess go play psychological on steam.

508
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I was I was going to say time.

509
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's timestamp this moment right now because it's after spoiler, but no, it's not done because I want to spoil a little bit more.

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm really wondering about like, will will Z will Z be like redeemed?

511
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Like, will she like, will she come out on top of this or not?

512
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Because it seems like she's kind of evil, but also like all the things she says are like good and like Hussey agree.

513
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I agree with them and Hussey agrees with them.

514
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, like she's kind of like a folk hero, even at the same time that she's like a complete sociopath.

515
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah.

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And like getting into some people killed.

517
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:48,000
She's a psycho and and but she's also like a rad socialist and a crazy juggler and that's a goth girl GF like sort of that's kind of cool.

518
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It is kind of cool.

519
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And like, I don't know.

520
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm rooting for her.

521
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't know.

522
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
She got her she got Percy killed though.

523
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
She did seem sad about it.

524
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So it was like, I feel like she didn't seem that sad about it.

525
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
She seemed like performatively.

526
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
She seemed like, I mean, it was an intense moment.

527
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:15,000
She gives him she gives him the kiss and then she seems like she's like moved by the moment, but not in a way that it's like, oh God, what have I done?

528
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This innocent person is dead.

529
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
No, yeah, she's too deep in it.

530
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is such high drama like like things are coming to such a such a cataclysmic head like yes, like I'm feeling like the drama of the moment.

531
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I got to give him a kiss because that's just what you do in this situation.

532
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That was my read on it.

533
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, I it's I think it's more that to show that she's not like completely lost her humanity that she does feel sad, but like she's too deep in it now to like turn back.

534
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
She's going to continue war.

535
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That moment made me think that she's like lost her humanity even more than I thought she had like that.

536
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like she immediately she's not even she's not worried about Percy the person she immediately starts like mythologizing him is like this is like the this is the first martyr in you know in the Jubilee war revolution or whatever.

537
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, maybe hadn't thought about it like that.

538
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But I but I know that like.

539
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But still, like, I like what she stands for and I think Hussey does too like she's she's not like completely villainous.

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I think it seems like maybe it's heading for like a like a hubris like a like a like a hubris down like a Lorax.

541
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

542
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like like this is like a good person with like some tragic flaws that will eventually lead to their destruction.

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That seems like the trajectory, but I don't know that the whole the whole Jubilee cosmic clown god thing could perhaps could perhaps have some impact on the direction.

544
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The story too.

545
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know.

546
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's that's just a possibility.

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I think the fact that there's like psychic damage and she's like clearly has like mental issues that the Jubilee clown is more likely like a like a mental problem.

548
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But like that we can see a cool space god thing.

549
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If I had to bet right now, I would say that this story is not actually like a supernatural thing that the God is the clown is just a thing in her mind.

550
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's my that's my I'll bet all my Bitcoin on that.

551
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, no.

552
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh, yeah.

553
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And then it will keep going up.

554
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then I'll have lost even more.

555
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
My losses will just keep compounding forever.

556
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah, never, never sell, never sell Bitcoin give you all only buy.

557
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, it goes down by it goes up by because it will only ever go up never down.

558
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But if it does go down, definitely buy.

559
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I like looking at the long term.

560
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't care about Bitcoin.

561
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm trying to talk about psychologials.

562
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Although, yeah, the Bitcoin stuff in there was funny.

563
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The whole like, like, I forget the name of the other girl.

564
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What was there?

565
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Abby.

566
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Abby.

567
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I like the whole like, you know, the super billionaires and then Z has this ingenious plan to steal all of their money.

568
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And flirts with Abby's mom.

569
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Gross.

570
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It was it was really like through emails and then gets Percy to do the voice.

571
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And it's such such a elaborate.

572
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's such the such an elaborate plan that I couldn't even imagine thinking of it for a character to think of in a story.

573
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know, I I thought it was weird that like there's like a throwaway line about like how Abby.

574
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Graduated Harvard by fucking all her professors and Abby's just like, lol, true.

575
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And like, I just thought that was a weird detail.

576
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I understand that like sex isn't bad, but like, I don't know.

577
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That doesn't.

578
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't feel like that's like a good.

579
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't feel like that reflects well on a person still.

580
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't even think I'm approved to think that.

581
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I mean, the fact that I don't think Abby is like an angel.

582
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She's no angel.

583
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
She's like, she heard she hears about like the fact that Z like shot a cop.

584
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I mean, admittedly, it was like.

585
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
In self-defense in a way, but we saw that it wasn't exactly when you get shot at.

586
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, like she's these these these gaslighting us, right?

587
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like was these keeps saying it's in self-defense, but like she's definitely.

588
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It wasn't completely.

589
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
She jumped at him, bit his arm or something, took the gun and then shot him a bunch of times.

590
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah.

591
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's like.

592
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He wasn't even really aiming for her.

593
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He shot her thing.

594
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Honestly, she but she says it.

595
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
She says so often and so confidently that like it was in self-defense that like I started to believe it.

596
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And then I was like, wait, and I had to go back and check and like.

597
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
She fooled me.

598
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
She gaslit me.

599
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's manipulator.

600
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So yeah, Abby sort of buys that.

601
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I guess that's just her being a good friend, but it's also like covering up a murder.

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So like she's not.

603
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's kind of covering up a murder.

604
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And she's totally okay with I mean, it's interesting because it's like.

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The literal what she's okay with.

606
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Like stealing all of her parents' money and then tricking them into having a divorce.

607
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It seems to be.

608
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's good for them, obviously, but she's sort of like it's good for her parents as well because they're not in a happy marriage.

609
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And she's like.

610
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't know.

611
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's hard to say that Abby is a bad person for going along with all that because there's like reasons why.

612
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That they sort of those billionaires deserve what they're what's coming to them as well.

613
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The billionaires deserve it.

614
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And like if she thinks that like the cop murder was in self-defense, like that's totally reasonable.

615
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah.

616
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Abby is like, yeah, like Abby doesn't really know.

617
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So like I just think it's it's kind of no.

618
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay, go on.

619
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I think.

620
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Well, yeah, I think she leans towards being the innocent sort of person in this.

621
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I assume is going to be a tragedy.

622
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I think Abby might be killed in this war, which will just feel Z to do even more danger dangerous blow up stuff.

623
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

624
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I just think it's a little weird and I don't really know what to think about the fact that like.

625
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I know that Hussie is like a cab kill cops and like loves clowns and like his the hero of this story is is like that.

626
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And yet she's kind of being portrayed as like this this dangerous like a sort of mentally unhinged like manipulator at the same time.

627
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's what he loves, dude.

628
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I guess I created risk and he loves her more than any other character in Homestuck.

629
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What you make an excellent point.

630
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's it's it's it's interesting because it's not just like an idea that you can root for like, oh yeah, like a cab like fuck the police and there's like a character that's just doing that and they're perfect in every other way.

631
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's it's not an idea it's a flawed human being which makes it more difficult to root for them even though you want to and that's why characters like that, like people really latch on to.

632
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Like the fact that Vriska was such a horrible person, but so right so often is like why is she so controversial and why I enjoy like her in so controversial and yet so brave and yet so brave.

633
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Literally.

634
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Good point.

635
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Good point.

636
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I fucking.

637
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Cyclone is so good.

638
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I want more people to play it.

639
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
There's like no.

640
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There's like no tweets about it.

641
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:13,000
There's like there's like six pieces of Psycholonial's fan art that you can find on floating around Twitter if you Google for it or if you if you search for it.

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's like very much like an on.

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I hadn't looked into it.

644
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But I would have assumed.

645
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh, it's the new Hussey thing like loads of people would be into it.

646
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Maybe they were all waiting for it the story to be over and there's silently hype.

647
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't know.

648
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I actually have like a half drawn picture of Z that I started doing and then kind of never quite finished.

649
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I should finish it and just post it somewhere because I really like it.

650
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Her clown makeup is pretty good.

651
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah, it is pretty good.

652
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's pretty good.

653
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's pretty good.

654
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I kind of for a minute there.

655
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I was thinking about making a clown so now just a little bit.

656
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Why not?

657
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Why the fuck not?

658
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't know.

659
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm not really I'm not that into wearing makeup and painting my face or anything, but I guess I could do it for a laugh.

660
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And then repeatedly every day until you die.

661
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because it would be really funny.

662
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Clown gender based horse gender cringe.

663
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, the horse gender aspect.

664
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The horse gender is so like like it's so dumb and it's I don't know.

665
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know whether to think that Hussey is dumb for even including the idea or are the characters dumb for for doing it.

666
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think it's part of like the cat because it was Abby's idea and then Z was like, no, it's perfect.

667
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, I suppose you have a point.

668
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I like the idea of it being stupider.

669
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So I'll make it stupider for you.

670
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Abby just has like this stupid idea and Z is like, yeah, she is like, okay.

671
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're my friend.

672
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So, okay, I'll make my sit my ideas dumber just like because you would like it.

673
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay, cool.

674
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah, the triangle of genders with the clown at the top coming together.

675
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's pretty good.

676
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's pretty fun.

677
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't know where I would put my side.

678
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I haven't really considered it.

679
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
In a way, I don't care.

680
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I guess like it's weird because like non binary, like being perfectly in the middle non binary would technically be like quite clown gendery in the sense that they don't necessarily ascribe to one or the other or care so much.

681
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But I guess they care about being in the middle.

682
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's like, how do you care?

683
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
How do you be a super non binary horse gender?

684
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
How do you be extremely both?

685
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You're like, you're extremely neither.

686
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're like a militant, a militant rejector of all that is.

687
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But that's, I feel like that would be clown gender.

688
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like a complete, like, I guess the clown part is like it doesn't matter.

689
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I think clown gender.

690
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
If you can do whatever.

691
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If you're clown gender, you can do masculine things, but it doesn't make you masculine.

692
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It doesn't mean anything because you're just a clown, right?

693
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah.

694
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Where I mean, it sounds like horse, horse non binary would be, yeah, would be, I guess you could do like a very deliberate melding of masculine and feminine, or you could be a very militant rejection of all this.

695
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:36,000
A horse, a horse gendered non binary person would be like half, they got a beard like half the side of their face and like long hair on the other side.

696
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And like they wear half of a dress on one side and then it's like completely split down the middle.

697
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Sounds like a contra points character.

698
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yes.

699
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But I was going to say something else about the the whole the clown gender thing is like the Psycholonial's version of like the shipping grids.

700
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah.

701
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Pussy loves stupid graphs that I mean I do as well.

702
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah.

703
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Just find take some take some concept that like clearly defies that like obviously defies like rigid categorization and then like very like very sort of bluntly like place it in a in a graphic form and then adhere to that graph.

704
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Religiously.

705
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yeah, it's like inherently funny.

706
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The idea of flooding gender on a specific graph and then clown also involved.

707
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And clowns are also just inherently funny.

708
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So, there you go.

709
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The whole the pranks.

710
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That was really good.

711
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Pranks is pretty good.

712
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I think I like I understand it intuitively, but I couldn't like describe pranks to someone like it's it's like doing stuff.

713
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I think it's funny.

714
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I think it's just I mean it's just it's just it's just being a it's just it's literally just being a socialist clown is what pranks is and also you you you fuck with people in ways that are funny.

715
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't know.

716
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Pranks is a funny name for a pretty for a pretty a pretty common sense concept I think which is fine, which is fine.

717
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I mean, Bitcoin, Bitcoin fraud.

718
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Bitcoin fraud doesn't strike me as as pranks is but that just kind of strikes me as just, you know, theft, which is fine.

719
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's particularly funny.

720
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's like Robin Hood.

721
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I guess the way she's doing it by seducing Abby's mom is pretty funny like that.

722
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That I might consider pranks like getting amateur porn and then Photoshopping the face of the guy she thinks she's talking to onto the amateur porn and sending that to her.

723
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Nudes is like that that's the prank part of pranks is that it wouldn't be funny if you just stole the money.

724
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You have to make it extremely embarrassing.

725
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I like I like hearing Abby, I like Abby's disgust at like her dad, her Republican dad.

726
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm like every every time Abby talks about that.

727
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I get like a little I don't know.

728
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's I know he's a fictional character, but you know, imagining this imagining this piece of shit like his daughter fucking like just duping him just duping him for being like a like a Republican fuck and just using that against him while like loathing him the entire time.

729
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm like, yes, it's fine that you fucked all your all your professors.

730
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Abby, you've redeemed yourself.

731
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah, it is a lot of it's it's like it's very cathartic because like obviously a militant clown uprising probably wouldn't be the best way to do socialism.

732
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But like for like seeing it like appear before you in this in this in this game this visual novel.

733
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's like, oh yeah, God, if only I wish, you know, yeah, yeah.

734
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Um, I had one more.

735
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I have one more thing I was going to say about clowns, Bitcoin Republicans.

736
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Fuck it's gone.

737
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay.

738
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We're going to say about like the how they switched to supporting Biden just because they

739
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, like in their pockets or whatever.

740
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I was just going to say that I feel like when I read Psycholonial's like in the very first chapter it talks about like it talks about like the elections and stuff and like cycle when I read Psycholonial's

741
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I can feel that like Hussey was feeling angst about like the state of politics, American politics.

742
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And I'm like I even though it's not even though that's not like a super.

743
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's not like a super important like story beat like it comes through in the writing and the way he talks about like current events and the times and I'm like, Hussey, I feel a connection with you through through this work.

744
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah.

745
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If you remember, if you remember like Homestuck had the Obama stuff and and the the future ridiculous future where Violent J Shaggy too dope and Guy Fieri will like took over the White House and and like took a shit on the Constitution.

746
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And it's like that stuff is so like ridiculous like wow crazy.

747
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
But then a few years later, Trump and it was like, oh, it's kind of true.

748
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's like it was a little bit of a little bit of to it would be like not even that satirical to make a joke like that in Homestuck.

749
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Was that was that pre Trump was the clown was the clown was the twin clown president stuff pre Trump.

750
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That was definitely pre Trump.

751
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't know if Homestuck ended before before Trump was in office, but I know that that part was already there because I caught up to it before 2016.

752
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Wait, wait, what if.

753
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Okay, just hear me out for a second.

754
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I got a great idea we should we should go back and we should fix Homestuck and the way we fix Homestuck is that you insert up.

755
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's on the day that Trump was elected.

756
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You have a panel where John Egbert just looks directly into the camera and says so here's the thing.

757
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I fucking hate Trump.

758
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He embarrasses me every day.

759
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
He makes us all look like backwards idiots and frankly the fact that he got elected means that we are all backwards idiots.

760
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You know what I'm referencing.

761
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Quinton reviews.

762
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, that's the Quinton just have John just deliver that word for word.

763
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It missed missed opportunities, though.

764
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

765
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm thinking, I don't know.

766
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I mean, I'll have to finish it and see how I feel.

767
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I think I would like to maybe make like a video or something in which I discuss.

768
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Psycholonials like after it's over.

769
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

770
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And I've read the whole thing.

771
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You should do a PCP again and just ask Hussey to be on.

772
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It'll be like, okay.

773
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
He's, I mean, he's getting no love for Psycholonial.

774
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So maybe he'd fucking do it.

775
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Maybe he would.

776
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah.

777
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah.

778
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, you got to stay optimistic.

779
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

780
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, you're right.

781
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
We should do some pranks on Hussey.

782
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We should invite him on the PCP and then.

783
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That's the best prank of all.

784
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And then steal all his Bitcoin while he's not looking.

785
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I think that's how you do it.

786
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I wonder if I wonder if Hussey has Bitcoin.

787
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Probably has a little bit.

788
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Who doesn't want to have a little bit of Bitcoin?

789
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's true.

790
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's true.

791
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Everybody's got to have some.

792
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because when the United States implodes and fiat currency is worthless,

793
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you better hope you have at least a little bit coin just to cover the necessities.

794
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's the hardest form of money ever invented, don't you know?

795
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Harder than diamond.

796
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Harder than diamond.

797
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh, no.

798
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's under 60K.

799
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, wait, it's back over 60K.

800
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay, it's fine.

801
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Few.

802
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
60026.

803
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Few.

804
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It was down.

805
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It was down to 59985 or something before a minute there.

806
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Incredible.

807
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's wobbling.

808
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No.

809
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's wobbling around the 60.

810
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But it's wobbling.

811
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, 60.

812
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
41.

813
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Why do you watch something that updates so much?

814
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I literally watch the like minute to minute, like by the second update.

815
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The app I have only updates by the hour and even then it's not accurate,

816
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
so I usually have to wait anyway.

817
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I mean, I go to, I use Kitco.

818
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I use kitco.com slash Bitcoin price charts, USD.

819
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Don't go there.

820
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Don't go there every few seconds.

821
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The link not in the description.

822
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Okay, all right.

823
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But I just got to know.

824
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
If it's updating once an hour,

825
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
like hell, 40 minutes ago, the market could have crashed

826
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and it could have lost 40% of its value.

827
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And I would, and I would never know.

828
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'd have to be a sap.

829
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'd have to be a sap not to watch one that updates every minute.

830
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
This was the problem the first time.

831
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
No, it's not that this, I don't, I don't look at it like all the time.

832
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
For a while I was looking at it all the time.

833
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
This time I like, I'll check it like once a day, like twice a day maybe.

834
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I don't actually like watch it going up and down.

835
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I mean, on the PCP, I'll keep it open continually.

836
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh, 23.

837
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh, down to 22.

838
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Are we going up or down from here?

839
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It just had a killer minute.

840
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The last minute it rose from 59915 to 60038.

841
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That was all in the space of one minute.

842
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Hovering at 60022.

843
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
60023.

844
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We're up.

845
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
We're up a dollar.

846
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
We're up a dollar.

847
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

848
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I'm closing it.

849
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm closing the app.

850
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I need this.

851
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I need this in my life.

852
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
What else?

853
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What else?

854
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, now is the time.

855
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Eleazar, link in the description here for, for cook, put, put a link to where you can

856
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
skip the Psycholonial spoilers.

857
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Because I genuinely, if people want to not be spoiled on Psycholonials, I don't want

858
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
to spoil it.

859
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah.

860
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Because I think, I think a lot of people should, I think people should be encouraged to read

861
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
it themselves.

862
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

863
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah.

864
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
In fact, put this audio before we talk about spoilers.

865
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Go play Psycholonials.

866
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's very, very good.

867
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's a visual novel, hussy written, extremely good character development.

868
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You will not want to be spoiled for it.

869
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And here's Tom Oliver.

870
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm here for my dollar.

871
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm here for the dollar I earn.

872
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Here's Tom Oliver.

873
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Just in time for us to stop talking about Psycholonials.

874
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Oh, good.

875
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
The game I've never, is it a game?

876
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Is it a show?

877
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't know what it is.

878
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's a game.

879
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I've never heard of it.

880
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It is a visual novel.

881
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So it's technically a game.

882
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Oh, all right.

883
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well.

884
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
By the most, by the most generous definition, it is a game.

885
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah.

886
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's good.

887
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Cool.

888
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Sick.

889
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Keep playing that game.

890
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What's up?

891
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Okay.

892
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We will, we will.

893
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Next, next update comes out on, was it like next Wednesday or there might be an off week?

894
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
No, there's an off week.

895
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The next update comes out on the 24th.

896
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So.

897
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Plenty of time for people to play it.

898
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
True.

899
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
True.

900
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Maybe I'll listen back to this episode and see if you can convince me to try it.

901
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Probably not.

902
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
If you don't care about spoilers, you can listen to what we said because it's, it's good.

903
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
All right.

904
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Um, what if we, what the fuck?

905
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah.

906
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
What's going on?

907
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm just vibing, hanging out.

908
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah.

909
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I was just on another podcast that was supposed to start at noon and it didn't start till

910
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
two.

911
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And I was like, well, I can't be on two podcasts at the same time.

912
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Or can I?

913
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You started a Mrs. Doubtfire sort of like two discord accounts open in two different windows.

914
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You just flipping your microphone back and forth from one to the other, two pairs of

915
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
headphones, one in each year.

916
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah.

917
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Imagine the antics.

918
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Laptop open on one with a microphone attached to there, desktop, the other one just kind

919
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
of flipping it back and forth.

920
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You know, I wasn't thinking.

921
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
They should, they should remake Mrs. Doubtfire, but it's about being in discord calls in 2020

922
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in the, in the pandemic.

923
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah.

924
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh yeah.

925
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I got a zoom, I got a zoom thing with like a family and I got a discord school in a Skype

926
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
poll.

927
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And it's, and it's about, and it's about being trans.

928
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's about being a boy motor and like you got one call with your family because like,

929
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
oh, my family's having their zoom call because we haven't seen each other.

930
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And the other one, it's like, oh, my cool, my cool zoomer friends, like, oh, they think

931
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I'm a girl, but my family still thinks I'm a boy.

932
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That's, that's Mrs. Doubtfire for the modern age.

933
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That's true.

934
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That would be.

935
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Send me a check, Hollywood.

936
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That'd be pretty powerful.

937
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Go, go on and sell that idea so Hollywood can fuck it up and make it really insulting.

938
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't care.

939
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
As long as I get paid.

940
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
As long as you get paid.

941
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's fine.

942
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Pay them a bit point.

943
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Please.

944
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's going to the moon.

945
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
As we talked about NFTs yet.

946
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I can't remember.

947
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
We talked about NFTs on the podcast.

948
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, we talked about them that one time.

949
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We didn't know what we were saying.

950
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We had just heard about it.

951
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
No, it's under 60.

952
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's under 60 K.

953
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, God, my life is over.

954
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You said you closed it.

955
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You closed it.

956
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I lied.

957
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I lied to your fucking face and I could do it again.

958
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Did Bitcoin hit 60 earlier today?

959
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yesterday, I think.

960
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, really?

961
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I didn't even.

962
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It almost hit 62, but it dipped a little bit since then.

963
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I like was getting excited about Bitcoin going up.

964
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And then I realized I have so little invested in Bitcoin.

965
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It would have to hit like 120,000 for it to do any significant amount of gains for me.

966
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Well, the solution is to buy more Bitcoin.

967
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
In fact, that's the solution to every problem in life.

968
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
My plan right now is every time Nate sends me a PCP payment,

969
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I just immediately I'm going to put into Bitcoin.

970
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Are you actually?

971
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That's what I did last month.

972
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know.

973
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
That's why I have Bitcoin.

974
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm holding for now, but I think a crash is coming.

975
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I really do.

976
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean, it has to eventually.

977
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It has to eventually.

978
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Brian's smarter than both of us combined.

979
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So I trust him with my life.

980
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Absolutely.

981
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
By far.

982
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I mean, this is the first time it's been so high.

983
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We haven't seen a crash from so high.

984
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So maybe it will never.

985
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I don't think it will crash.

986
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's too big a fail.

987
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It will crash all the way back down.

988
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
But it could drop 20K easily.

989
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It crashed like that percentage before.

990
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah.

991
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That's when you capitalize.

992
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
No, I think that like eventually it will crash back all the way down to like 20K

993
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
or maybe even low at some point.

994
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Like it's.

995
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I am.

996
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't think it's thinking about Ethereum though, because Ethereum is what's

997
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
powering all this NFT stuff.

998
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And I feel like that's to explode once NFTs really start taking off.

999
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I don't think NFTs are going to take off.

1000
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I don't think NFTs are going to take off.

1001
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
No, they totally will.

1002
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I think they're a stupid meme and everyone hates them.

1003
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
They're a meme in their current form, but I guarantee you that like the entire

1004
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
like Zoomer culture is primed to be like bragging rights, digital ownership.

1005
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Like it's going to be big.

1006
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
There's going to, it's going to be.

1007
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I don't, I don't think that's true.

1008
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't agree.

1009
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think it is.

1010
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's like, it's like patently, it's patent nonsense.

1011
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Like what, like an NFT is like so manifestly, like a worthless thing.

1012
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But like we do, we spend money on worthless things all the time.

1013
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Like, you know, like you can buy a baseball with a signature on it.

1014
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's worth like $10 trillion.

1015
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That, that, that weird illogical sense of like connection to something is, is there

1016
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
in human psychology.

1017
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But that's not true.

1018
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But like an NFT is something that like anyone can just make like out of, out of the ether

1019
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
can just generate it.

1020
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Like there's no supply and demand.

1021
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
The supply and demand curve is just, okay, all it needs is a few people who know how

1022
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to make NFTs and suddenly everything in the world can be NFT'd.

1023
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And, and that's that like fucks up the supply demand curve.

1024
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Well, that's because I don't think that's how it works.

1025
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It's not, it's not just making an NFT.

1026
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's about, it's about tracking where it comes from, right?

1027
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Like if some random person tried to mint an NFT of like a famous YouTubers like content

1028
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
or something, that wouldn't be worth anything.

1029
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But if the YouTuber themselves minted the NFT, it's the connection between like this

1030
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
is an NFT made by this person.

1031
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's attached permanently on the blockchain to their initial source of ownership.

1032
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And just like signing a baseball is like attached to a famous player.

1033
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Once a celebrity like attaches it to that, it's just a digital version of that same

1034
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
sort of collector mentality.

1035
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But it's gonna stick.

1036
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I guess that makes sense.

1037
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm wondering though about how you can, like how visible and obvious that would be.

1038
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Like, like if, if.

1039
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
As far as I understand, it was like, there's like a, the ledger lets you know where it's,

1040
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
where it's been, where it's come from.

1041
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Like you track of sales so you can see where it originated.

1042
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm just thinking of like smaller people, smaller creators, not super celebrities.

1043
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And then like people who like make accounts that have similar characters in them, but

1044
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
like instead of an eye, it's like an eye with a slanted thing at the top and they could

1045
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
just pretend like, I know it like for the largest, like huge things like a, I don't

1046
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
know, Johnny Depp took a picture of his himself taking a shit.

1047
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And that's like a thing.

1048
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then that's like, oh, it's a Johnny Depp original from his phone.

1049
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Like this is the one, like people would pay attention, I guess, pay attention to like

1050
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
something that is big celebrity.

1051
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But like, there was a lot of people talking about how it's the future of like, like just

1052
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
art in general, just anyone who wants their art to be like.

1053
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't, I don't think, I think it's gonna be just like anything else where like,

1054
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
most people won't get anywhere with it, but there's going to be a few people.

1055
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It's just going to be another way for like you to leverage the cloud you already have,

1056
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
you know, it's not like any random schmuck is going to be able to mint an NFT of like

1057
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
their DeviantArt account and make billions of dollars.

1058
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Like you already have to have some social currency in order to make your NFT valuable.

1059
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But I think if you, if you already have a brand and NFT is just going to make it more

1060
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
valuable because I think one of the most interesting things about NFTs is that

1061
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
the smart contract attached to them gives you residuals.

1062
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So like, let's say, Ben.

1063
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

1064
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Okay.

1065
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Ben, Ben, let's say you mint an NFT representing like, like the first issue of the Vapors,

1066
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
right?

1067
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's like, there's, this represents the first issue of the Vapors that I made and you can

1068
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
buy this NFT and it represents it, right?

1069
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
And you put it up there and people can buy it, but part of the contract, like part of

1070
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the thing of the NFT is like, you can set a percentage.

1071
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So every time it's resold, you get X% of that sale.

1072
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So let's say someone buys that NFT off you for like $100.

1073
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Let's say the Vapors blows up and gets fucking huge, like when like, you know, like issue

1074
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
five or six, whatever comes out, like it does gangbusters, whatever reason.

1075
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
The NFT's value goes up and someone's like, I want to sell this NFT now that it's worth

1076
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
money.

1077
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm going to sell it for $60,000.

1078
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
In that contract, you get $6,000 from that sale.

1079
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And then if someone sells it again for $100,000, you get $10,000 and in perpetuity, every time

1080
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
that NFT gets resold on the market, you get a kickback, which is better than a collectible

1081
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
because a normal collectible, all the money goes to the whoever acquired it.

1082
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And that's an interesting idea.

1083
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
That is an interesting idea.

1084
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I mean, is it like in the form of like some Ethereum that just like appears in your wallet

1085
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
or whatever?

1086
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I believe it's all done through Ethereum right now.

1087
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And then you can obviously exchange that for real currency.

1088
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But the idea that like you can have a digital equivalent of like a collectible and then

1089
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
in perpetuity, you can keep making money off of its reselling.

1090
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I think is a really interesting idea even on a small scale, right?

1091
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Like let's say when you release the Vapors five, you mint like 15 NFTs.

1092
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Like the first 15 people who buy this, they get an NFT attached to it.

1093
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You know, you get the digital file and you also get an NFT.

1094
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And then if somebody else in your audience wants to buy it for like 20 bucks, you get two bucks.

1095
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You know, like that's kind of cool.

1096
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The biggest problem with NFTs is the environmental impact, which I think is definitely a problem.

1097
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Ethereum is saying they're changing the way that mining Ethereum works.

1098
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's not going to be done based on mining starting next year, which could severely reduce the energy problem,

1099
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
which could be interesting.

1100
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't know.

1101
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I just think that there's something about like an NFT is just not as attractive as like, I mean,

1102
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
the obvious parallel here is like the fine art world where some like rich idiot pays like $50,000 for some painting.

1103
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But at least that's like a thing that you can understand what it is and see and look at.

1104
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
An NFT is like most people just don't know what it is and it isn't really anything.

1105
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's literally just like a handshake of like, OK, we both know you own something now.

1106
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But the same reason, I agree, and I totally think you're right.

1107
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I think the problem is that there's just...

1108
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I feel like that's a problem for adoption.

1109
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I feel like it just doesn't have that as much social value attached to it because people don't understand it.

1110
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I just think there are people out there because there is, people have bought NFTs for $70 million.

1111
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
This is a thing that's already happening.

1112
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But I think there's just people out there who are like, the reason they would buy a fine piece of art is for the clout,

1113
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
like for the bragging rights.

1114
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And an NFT gives you the exact same thing.

1115
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Like even though you're not getting a tangible item, it's still the underlying reason is the same.

1116
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The thing you're bragging about is not something that as many people can appreciate what you're telling them.

1117
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It is that you own.

1118
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I think people our age will think it's stupid.

1119
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I think younger kids who have grown up with an iPhone in their hand and everything has been digital

1120
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and microtransactions and buying digital goods is a part of their psychology are going to be way more into it.

1121
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And I think that's why it's going to be viable going forward.

1122
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I don't know about that.

1123
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I think that growing up more exposed to the internet might just make you more likely to be like,

1124
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so it's just like some random data that you both agree represents a thing.

1125
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Obviously, that's worthless.

1126
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I feel like the younger people might be even less likely to take it seriously.

1127
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
If I think of the parallels to reality, if you've got a big old mansion, you're like,

1128
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I want to show off my art clout, my taste.

1129
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm going to buy some big old paintings and put them in here and people will come around for dinner parties.

1130
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And they'll look at them and I'll say, haha, I'm rich and I bought this and I have great taste.

1131
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And this is the clout. You're impressed, aren't you?

1132
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Right.

1133
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The equivalent of that in the digital space, I don't know where you would show off that you have it.

1134
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You would just have to make a platform.

1135
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's the same way that back in the day, you would customize your MySpace page and put all a bunch of memes and images and songs on there.

1136
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,000
You would acquire things and put them on this space to represent who you are and to show to the world who you are.

1137
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And NFTs are going to be the exact same thing.

1138
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They're going to be platforms, but they're already a platform so you can show what's in your wallet, what you own.

1139
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And it's just a way of like, I guess flexing, I don't know.

1140
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I don't personally think it matters. I think it's dumb. I think society's going to like that.

1141
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Sure, sure. I'm just trying to think of like, if it's a flex and obviously if you want people to see,

1142
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it needs to be in a place where people can see it.

1143
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
If it's a new social media that is just for flexing, nobody's going to go over there to look.

1144
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It'll need to be on like current social media or whatever integrated.

1145
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Like you go to someone's Twitter.

1146
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Or it could be built. It really depends.

1147
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think we're still a few years out from it becoming mainstream if it ever picks up that kind of steam.

1148
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's not going to happen like tomorrow.

1149
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Say for example, Elon Musk buys like the founder of Twitter's first tweet or something.

1150
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
That sentence you just said just made me want to throw out.

1151
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's already going for two and a half million dollars.

1152
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It's fucking stupid, but say that he wants to show off that he did that.

1153
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,000
He could pin a tweet saying he did. He could put it in his description or what?

1154
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's so very volatile right now.

1155
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,000
If they become big, they'll be integrated into platforms and new platforms will spring up to facilitate the system.

1156
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I don't know. I just feel like ultimately where the people are is where this is the most useful.

1157
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think the thing is people don't really, at the moment, because it's hype.

1158
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They don't really care about the art itself.

1159
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
They buy these things under the assumption that they will appreciate in value and then they can sell them on.

1160
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:51,000
If that's the case, I don't see how it's going to stick around at all.

1161
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
The market that's there right now I think is going to crash eventually.

1162
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's too big and people are just riding high and it's going to be just like the internet.

1163
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The early 90s web boom, it popped and the same things that happened in NFTs.

1164
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
How exactly do you display that you own an NFT?

1165
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I think there's some websites like OpenSeenRarable where you have your wallet and if you go to your profile, it'll show all the NFTs you own.

1166
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
On the record of the NFT, it shows who the current owner is.

1167
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
If you go and look up a people NFT, it'll show whoever owns it right now.

1168
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I suppose it's not that different in theory from buying adoptables.

1169
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
People are so fucking stupid.

1170
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:49,000
My little sister was showing me a video yesterday about a YouTuber who spent four months trying to get number one on the leaderboards for the world's fastest pencil sharpener.

1171
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Unassisted, like tool-less pencil sharpening.

1172
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Tool-assisted?

1173
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
This strat is task only for sharpening pencils.

1174
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Well, that's the whole thing. There was a leaderboard for drills and no drills on this.

1175
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I'm just thinking if people are stupid enough to chase that, why wouldn't NFTs make sense?

1176
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
You laugh, but that's as valid as any other field of human endeavor.

1177
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It's about attaining excellence for its own sake. You're just a hater.

1178
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I saw a video about a guy on his journey to the top of the leaderboard.

1179
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It was such a small thing, and then he made his video, and then it became a big thing, and now everyone's doing it.

1180
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I was at the iCarly one?

1181
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I have no idea.

1182
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I saw that.

1183
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But that's my whole point. People are doing this just because A, for the meme, and B, because I can be number one on this.

1184
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's chasing that pseudo-glory, I guess.

1185
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And I feel like NFTs tap into that same kind of part of your brain where it's just like, I want to own the thing for the cloud.

1186
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's too much. It's too similar, because it's also an environmental drain, because all of those pencils get destroyed and used.

1187
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh, sure.

1188
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Get all those trees. There's no trees left.

1189
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Yeah, that's the big problem with NFTs right now, is that the whole market is so unsustainable, and so environmentally unfriendly, because it uses so much energy.

1190
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And that's a problem that's going to have to be addressed.

1191
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
To be clear, I'm not endorsing NFTs.

1192
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm saying, I believe they're going to happen.

1193
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Just like everything else that's bad about the internet has happened, despite me not liking any of it.

1194
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I don't know. I understand. They just seem so backwards and counter-intuitive.

1195
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It kind of takes us a huge step backwards in terms of what the internet enabled, which is access abundance.

1196
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
We've artificially introduced scarcity again, which can be beneficial in some ways.

1197
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Being able to make residuals off of tokens from your art and stuff, that's kind of cool.

1198
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I do kind of like that idea, but it's going to enable so much worse things than just that.

1199
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
A better idea is just getting rid of the need to make money. That's probably a better idea.

1200
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That's never going to happen.

1201
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I saw people were saying, OK, Sean on Twitter made a tweet that said,

1202
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
we can't solve climate change under capitalism.

1203
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
He was roundly attacked from so-called leftists who claimed that he was being a doomer

1204
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and saying that there was no hope to fix climate change then.

1205
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Obviously, the implication there is we have to remove capitalism.

1206
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
We need to become socialists. That's how you solve climate change.

1207
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
His bio said he was a socialist. This is like a streamer or something.

1208
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
This is a socialist guy who's like, you're just making people want to give up.

1209
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Saying you can't solve climate change under capitalism, that's just so doomer.

1210
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
This is just accelerationism.

1211
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I don't know. I think there's some people who just want-

1212
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You fucking idiot. Don't you not like capitalism? What's wrong with you?

1213
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I think they're projecting. They are the doomers

1214
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
because they think that capitalism is so difficult to get rid of

1215
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that it's not even worth trying.

1216
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
They're the doomers because they're the ones that will never abolish capitalism

1217
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
or at least not within our lifetimes.

1218
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Maybe they're right about that, but I don't know.

1219
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I believe that we probably can't fix climate change under capitalism.

1220
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
We will have to move to socialism.

1221
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
If you believe that, then it's not doomer to just acknowledge that

1222
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
because then the hopeful thing to do

1223
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
would then, even if we can't achieve it in our lifetimes,

1224
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
to try to move towards it in whatever ways we can

1225
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
because that's what leads to long-term improving the situation.

1226
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's not doomer just to acknowledge that if you think it's true.

1227
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I really hate the attitude that a lot of people had about calling it-

1228
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It's like you don't even understand what words mean.

1229
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
A doomer would be-

1230
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You get it. You understand.

1231
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah, it's just like the-

1232
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's what Sean's saying, and I haven't seen the tweet itself,

1233
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
but based on what you said-

1234
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I think I said it or made him.

1235
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's not mutually exclusive.

1236
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You can understand that capitalism needs to go before climate change is completely possible,

1237
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and you can combat climate change under capitalism as well.

1238
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You can do both of those things.

1239
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't think what Sean's saying is implying that you should try not to do anything under capitalism.

1240
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You can both try to get rid of capitalism and then also climate change.

1241
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
He totally was not saying that, and yet tons of people read that into it

1242
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
and criticized it as though that was what he said.

1243
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Very, very frustrating.

1244
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I hate Twitter.

1245
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
The left has always been very bad with language in general, so it doesn't-

1246
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
That's true.

1247
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That's true.

1248
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It's sad but true.

1249
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
More like shitter.

1250
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
More like shitter.

1251
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Oh, I want to mention about the Noida stream that I did on Wednesday.

1252
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I have some things.

1253
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
One, it was really fun to play Noida and tell everyone about the game.

1254
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Two, I don't understand why it had all these problems.

1255
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
The game lagged in ways that it never lags before.

1256
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I closed all my other applications.

1257
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I was cutting off CPU usage.

1258
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I couldn't get it to run at its normal speed.

1259
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I don't know why.

1260
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It was very infuriating.

1261
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I beat the game on stream.

1262
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It was very satisfying.

1263
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And then a guy, a guy who was in chat, I guess he was just so chuffed that I beat Noida.

1264
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
He bought me a fridge.

1265
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
What the fuck?

1266
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
A fridge?

1267
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
This Chalupa-kun is his name on Discord.

1268
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
He was like, yo, congrats on beating Noida.

1269
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Let me buy you a mini-frame.

1270
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And he did.

1271
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And I have it.

1272
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I have it here.

1273
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Right now, it's an $80 mini-fridge.

1274
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
What a madman.

1275
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
That's literally what I said.

1276
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I said, absolute madman.

1277
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's a 1.7-foot cube.

1278
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Cubic.

1279
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's a galan's.

1280
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It arrived from Amazon.

1281
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It is currently holding many bottles of flavored seltzer water.

1282
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So I just want to say that this is just what happens when you're a pro MLG gamer like me.

1283
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You make dividends.

1284
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You reap the rewards of pro gaming.

1285
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You put all your energy drinks in there.

1286
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Your gamer fuel.

1287
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm all out of Summit Gridlock.

1288
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
In fact, I'm out of almost every source of caffeine.

1289
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I've had to brew coffee.

1290
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Ugh.

1291
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I've had to do it like the cavemen used to do.

1292
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah, I had coffee earlier today.

1293
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I had moved entirely to Gridlock in pills.

1294
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Oh my God.

1295
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
There's no joy if you have caffeine pills.

1296
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
That's half the fun.

1297
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Half the fun is getting caffeine and enjoying the process.

1298
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Not, you know.

1299
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's the most efficient.

1300
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
You say it like that.

1301
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It's the most efficient.

1302
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I don't know.

1303
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I enjoy having a nice beverage.

1304
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I think I'm going to try moving back to Gridlock.

1305
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I just got a bunch of red thunder and it's just not nearly as good as Red Bull.

1306
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I'm just like, ugh, it just tastes terrible.

1307
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Maybe I'll try Gridlock again.

1308
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I don't understand how a person ever stops drinking Gridlock once they start.

1309
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's simply the beverage champions.

1310
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
The last time I had Gridlock, I just remember being like, this is like monster but worse

1311
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
because I don't even like monster that much.

1312
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
But it's so cheap I have to give it another shot.

1313
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I would agree.

1314
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It is like monster.

1315
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It is maybe slightly worse than monster but not like, notice, not much worse.

1316
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And I like monsters.

1317
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So to me, it's like still good.

1318
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Right, right, right.

1319
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
That's just me.

1320
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That makes sense.

1321
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
That's just me.

1322
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Nice.

1323
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Very nice.

1324
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Too many, too many seltzer waters.

1325
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, Tom.

1326
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Project Blue.

1327
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah, the Windows version of Astropad.

1328
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Do you like my starter there?

1329
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That was a good one.

1330
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I don't know.

1331
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That was like skipping a stone.

1332
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Project Blue, it's like a, I got my iPad on the assumption that eventually this thing

1333
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
would come out called Astropad.

1334
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It took way longer than I told you it would.

1335
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yep.

1336
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
But it's fine, it's whatever.

1337
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:19,000
But my tablet that I've been using for my computer for a while, like my bamboo is broken.

1338
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And I just wanted a way to like draw on my computer, my PC.

1339
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And this thing apparently-

1340
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You can draw on a computer?

1341
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I know, it's weird.

1342
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
You get a crayon, you shove it in there and you draw.

1343
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
No, very nice.

1344
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And now I can get my iPad, my Apple product, and compatible with Windows.

1345
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And I've been drawing a little bit.

1346
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It doesn't really seem to work with pen pressure on Photoshop.

1347
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I don't know why.

1348
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Maybe it's an older version of Photoshop and it doesn't recognize it or something.

1349
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It works on some other things.

1350
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yeah, I looked into Windows Inc.

1351
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
But I couldn't figure it out.

1352
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
What version of Photoshop do you have right now?

1353
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Let me check.

1354
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
How do I check?

1355
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm hovering over the icon.

1356
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Photoshop CS6, CS5, CC.

1357
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I don't think they added Windows Inc. support to like CC.

1358
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Like the older ones.

1359
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Like the older ones don't even have high DPI support.

1360
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
That's like the problem.

1361
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
That's why I don't use Photoshop anymore.

1362
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I have band in that motherfucker.

1363
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
CC 2018 is what I have.

1364
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It should have Windows Inc. support then.

1365
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That's pretty new.

1366
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That's new-ish.

1367
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Well, I don't know.

1368
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Whatever.

1369
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I'll try and figure it out.

1370
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Just yell at them on Twitter until they respond to you.

1371
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Yeah.

1372
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But yeah, it's cool.

1373
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I just like that finally my iPad can be used for the thing I bought it for.

1374
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Even though it's been great for drawing with Procreate this whole time I've been drawing.

1375
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The only annoying thing with drawing on an iPad is having to transfer my files.

1376
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Because I haven't found a really smooth, simple way to do it.

1377
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I've just been like sending them to myself through Discord and then opening them in Discord on my PC and then using them there.

1378
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The file manager on iOS still is not great.

1379
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
They'll never fix it because they're like, you just need to pay for iCloud Drive storage.

1380
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
That's what we want you to do.

1381
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I'm just like, no, I refuse.

1382
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

1383
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So what's Project Blue?

1384
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's the thing where I kill you.

1385
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Okay.

1386
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yep.

1387
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm dead.

1388
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Sorry.

1389
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Got to listen back to the podcast.

1390
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Okay.

1391
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I would never listen to this hog swallow.

1392
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
This corn swash.

1393
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It's a public beta of a company called Astropad.

1394
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
They started by making an application that let you hook your iPad up to your Mac and use it as a waycom.

1395
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Like a waycom sensitive sensor.

1396
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And they finally released their public beta of using it with Windows because Apple two years ago they added that feature natively to macOS.

1397
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Basically stole their idea, bundled it in there and fucked them over.

1398
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
There's actually a term in the Apple community.

1399
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's called getting Sherlocked because they made a feature called Sherlock that copied something back in the day.

1400
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
But yeah, they do that all the time.

1401
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
They'll pilfer the best ideas from their community and then copy them and fuck their developers out of money.

1402
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So once that happened to them, they're like, well, I guess we got to go port it to Windows now so we can keep making money.

1403
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Okay.

1404
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Makes sense.

1405
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah.

1406
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Sounds good.

1407
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah.

1408
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Ben, you've not...

1409
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Should I invest in it?

1410
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Should I sell my Bitcoin and invest in Project Blue?

1411
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You should give me your Bitcoin so I can invest for you.

1412
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Okay.

1413
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Thank you.

1414
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I expect returns at an undetermined point somewhere in the future.

1415
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
On my grave.

1416
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You can have it back.

1417
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Okay.

1418
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's basic.

1419
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But yeah, the Apple Pencil version one, at least.

1420
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I've really enjoyed using that.

1421
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
It's a great little stylus.

1422
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It's surprisingly good.

1423
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Sort of little rubberized tip with the screen.

1424
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It feels so much like an actual pencil on paper.

1425
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I was super...

1426
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There's no way this is going to work.

1427
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It doesn't have a cursor.

1428
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It doesn't have float support.

1429
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Like a Waycom thing does.

1430
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You can't see where the cursor is and then it's like, oh no, it's just so good.

1431
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It just works like a regular pencil.

1432
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It just feels like a real pencil.

1433
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
It's so much easier to transition from physical to iPad.

1434
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I like it.

1435
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I think it's good.

1436
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
It's pretty good.

1437
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Well, la di da.

1438
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah.

1439
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Well, I just thought about it.

1440
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Okay.

1441
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
You don't have to kill me.

1442
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yeah.

1443
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Well, you shouldn't have.

1444
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Please don't kill me.

1445
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I do have to do that.

1446
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

1447
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Some of us try out Project Blue.

1448
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Some of us get a free mini fridge.

1449
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You know, lives take different paths.

1450
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
You can't do both.

1451
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You can't do both.

1452
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Something.

1453
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Okay.

1454
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Fair.

1455
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Okay.

1456
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Fair.

1457
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Well, my replacement Cintiq since my last one broke recently is doing great.

1458
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Thanks for asking.

1459
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Hell yeah.

1460
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Hell yeah.

1461
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Why'd you get a replacement from?

1462
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Did you buy it?

1463
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I think I just bought it on eBay.

1464
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I think I bought one on eBay.

1465
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
How much?

1466
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It's a Cintiq.

1467
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Well, I mean, Cintiqs are old now.

1468
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
This is, um, I think it cost me like 200 and change.

1469
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Okay.

1470
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Like not that much.

1471
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Uh, I had to, I had to get a new pen though because I had an, okay.

1472
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The story is my old Cintiq was a, um, hang on, let me, let me look at the back of the,

1473
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
of the monitor.

1474
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It was a, I might be able to switch things around.

1475
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I think the old one was a DTK and then they had basically made an updated version of the

1476
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,000
DTK that was identical, except it had like a slightly different button layout and a slightly

1477
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
higher, like pixel resolution.

1478
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And that was the DTZ.

1479
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I might be switching them, but whatever.

1480
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So the DTZ was basically identical, slightly better.

1481
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,000
The old one that I had, um, um, somebody gave me as a, just as a gift and that was a DTK

1482
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
and those ones were like over a decade old.

1483
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The new version, they made, they redid it that the DTZ like a few years later.

1484
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So this one is like slightly less old, but the DTK eventually just the screen stopped

1485
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
displaying.

1486
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Like it would still like know that I was drawing on it and it would take input, but the screen

1487
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
just was dead and wouldn't show anything.

1488
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So it was like too old.

1489
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I don't know.

1490
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So I got this one, which is, um, basically the same model except like a slightly newer

1491
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
iteration of it.

1492
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And yeah, I mean, these are old machines.

1493
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
They don't, uh, they were like thousands of dollars when they were new, but now they're

1494
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
just like a couple hundred.

1495
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
This one came, but it came with a, even though it's like a newer, even though it's like a

1496
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
newer, uh, model, it needed like a different thing, even though it's like the same item

1497
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
as the previous one, I just, I needed to get a different stylus, uh, which is irritating

1498
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,000
because the first time I had the original one, the original one, I had bought a newer

1499
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
stylus and tried to use it.

1500
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And they were like, no, this model doesn't work with the new styles.

1501
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You have to use the old stylus.

1502
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So we got that.

1503
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And then I get this one and I realize I've lost the other, the other stylus that I originally

1504
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
bought that didn't work with the other model would have worked with this one, but I lost

1505
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
it.

1506
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I don't know where it is.

1507
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So I just have to buy another one, but a stylus is like 70 bucks or not even that.

1508
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Let me be like 50.

1509
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
So like, it wasn't that big a deal.

1510
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Just annoying.

1511
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Uh, but I mean, that's all in the past.

1512
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
That's all in the past.

1513
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It works poifically now.

1514
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Poifect.

1515
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And it's better.

1516
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
It has more buttons than the old one too, which is nice.

1517
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And also the old one was like dim and like the colors were a little bit like tinted red

1518
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
and kind of dim and they didn't look the same as my normal monitor.

1519
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
The new one looks much closer in its color display to my regular monitor.

1520
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:02,000
So I think it's a good upgrade from something that's like 12 years old to like eight thumbs

1521
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
up.

1522
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And that's my story.

1523
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Wow.

1524
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Yeah.

1525
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Thanks.

1526
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,340
Uh, I don't know if you guys got anything else to talk about, but if you don't, we could

1527
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,000
move on to voicemails.

1528
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,500
Um, I guess the only other thing is I've been playing minesweeper a lot.

1529
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,500
Getting into that.

1530
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Oh yeah.

1531
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,500
Oh God.

1532
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,500
I guess I got to practice.

1533
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,800
I've been practicing.

1534
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,500
I've been getting so good.

1535
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,000
I can find the mines.

1536
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Damn.

1537
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Find those mines and sweep them.

1538
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I can sweep those mines.

1539
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Against the average idiot, I would feel pretty confident that I could win minesweeper, but

1540
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
if you like actually, you play pick cross and you're practicing minesweeper.

1541
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So I'm going to disadvantage.

1542
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to study up.

1543
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah.

1544
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
You're going to study yourself.

1545
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm going to have to study advanced mine, not Minecraft, sorry, minesweeper theory.

1546
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
But I mean, I'm a pro Minecraft player, so like the skills are probably transferable

1547
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
in some way.

1548
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Dude, what if there was like minesweeper in Minecraft?

1549
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah, like there's mines in some blocks and you have to, and like they tell you the number

1550
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and you have like, yeah.

1551
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
That would be funny.

1552
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Somebody, somebody should have made that mod.

1553
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
There's TNT in the game, so.

1554
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You'd have to have like a minesweeper craft.

1555
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You'd have to like get a code that like plants bunches of TNT all over the world's generation

1556
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
in every biome.

1557
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, here we go.

1558
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I think, I think there is minesweeper version two in Minecraft.

1559
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
This is a video posted on September 8th, 2011.

1560
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Let me, let me get it here.

1561
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Here we go.

1562
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It's real.

1563
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
September of 2011.

1564
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's so old.

1565
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
You can't, there's no, not even hunger.

1566
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
You can't even run.

1567
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Wait a minute though.

1568
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Okay, I think this is too, I think it's a 2D game just being played in Minecraft.

1569
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Like the minesweeper game.

1570
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I would be cooler if it were 3D.

1571
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You know what I mean?

1572
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Like, like if the mines were not just on a 2D plane.

1573
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
God, when's it gonna hit the, when's it gonna hit a mine?

1574
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
This is such a great podcast as reacting to a video that nobody can see.

1575
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It's really uninteresting a video.

1576
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I thought, is he just taking it himself?

1577
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
No, don't play the video.

1578
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It's not even worth it.

1579
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I'm waiting for him to hit a mine.

1580
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Show me the mine.

1581
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
He's not even, it's not even a mod.

1582
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
He's just like placed blocks and put dirt on top of it and he's just digging them.

1583
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
He knows where everything is.

1584
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
He put it there.

1585
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
This guy's a fucking liar.

1586
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Is this, no, is this just a single minesweeper map?

1587
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Yeah, I think it is.

1588
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay, that's lame.

1589
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That's so lame.

1590
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Oh, he did it.

1591
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah, he's going.

1592
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
He's dying.

1593
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Oh, it doesn't even kill him though.

1594
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Well, that's, no, it's not good unless it like generates a random map.

1595
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
That's the only way that it's okay.

1596
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Disappointing.

1597
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Wasn't there a minesweeper in RFCK?

1598
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yeah, you would have to play like a mines, a version of minesweeper when you were mining to get slime for a while.

1599
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I think they took it out because it was like really annoying or something.

1600
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Imagine like tech space, like click on this square, put flag on this square, like it's be so slow.

1601
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I never like saw the game.

1602
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I never saw like what that looked like.

1603
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think it's like, it's a weird thing that I know existed in the past, but I don't know what it looked like.

1604
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And I think I want to leave it that way.

1605
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Just like leave the mystery.

1606
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But yeah, there was minesweeper in Endless War for a little bit.

1607
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Voicemails?

1608
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Uh, yeah.

1609
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Oh, wait, we're gonna do the bonus episode.

1610
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Uh, we should record the minesweeper bonus challenge this week.

1611
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, I could, I think, I think I'm gonna lose, but it's okay.

1612
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I want, I want it poker.

1613
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I want it poker.

1614
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Anyone who subscribed to the Patreon knows about the time that I beat you and Nate at poker and I took all your money and it was really funny.

1615
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, but you didn't take all my money.

1616
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
You took like most of it though.

1617
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Didn't I, didn't I like clean up?

1618
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Didn't I end up with like the entire pot?

1619
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,000
No, I think, I think the idea was like if you lose, you don't lose like 100% of your earnings for that episode.

1620
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Yeah, it was some, maybe it was some, some like funny because I knew I was not going to win.

1621
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So I didn't want all of it to be gone.

1622
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It was very, very good though.

1623
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Very funny.

1624
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Um, yeah, we'll do, you can do that this week.

1625
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Uh, I, man, I would maybe, I would be willing to do more Noida streams.

1626
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I just wish they weren't so plagued with like technical bullshit.

1627
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Like, like too, too much of that stream was me just like trying to under, like figure out like why the CPU was chugging so much.

1628
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
You just need a better computer.

1629
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I know it can't be true.

1630
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It's always the answer.

1631
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
What is, what's your computer specs?

1632
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
They always be the answer.

1633
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
What's, how old's your computer?

1634
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
What, what are you running?

1635
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
What's that hardcore band rig?

1636
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's not that old.

1637
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I, I, this is the computer that I bought from the GoFundMe that I did when I was living at, at Trixie's house in like 2017 or 2018.

1638
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So it's only like three or four years old.

1639
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Like it's not an old computer.

1640
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That shouldn't be terrible, I guess.

1641
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
The definition of old changes with time.

1642
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I guess, like, how high end was it at the time? That's the question.

1643
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It was, it was decently high end.

1644
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I think I spent like, I spent more than like $1,000 on all the parts and stuff.

1645
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Like it has like, it had like a graphics card that was like very new at the time.

1646
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I mean, you can't even buy a new computer right now anyways.

1647
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Everything's so fucking expensive because it's all out of stock.

1648
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That's true.

1649
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So you're kind of fucked.

1650
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Nothing to be done.

1651
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah.

1652
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:55,000
The graphics card that I bought two years ago for $180 used right now is going used for $550.

1653
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Oh my God.

1654
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know if you, I don't know if you guys remember, but there was a whole thing when I got this computer that was like the GoFundMe paid for.

1655
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Somebody told me, like, somebody gave me like specs of like what motherboard to get and what graphics card to get and all these other parts.

1656
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And I was like, okay, and I got the, but someone was like, hey, you can get this different motherboard for like $50 less.

1657
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And I was like, I want to save $50.

1658
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And I got it.

1659
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And that motherboard ended up being a complete nightmare.

1660
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And it, it made the computer like unusable for like six months while I was like taking it to repair shops and like sending the parts back and waiting for replacements.

1661
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That was like the worst 50, I think I ended up just not even getting, I think I ended up buying the more expensive one in the end.

1662
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That was like so annoying.

1663
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That was, that was the worst.

1664
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
You don't really want to cheap out of any component.

1665
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It worked.

1666
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Like on paper, it looked like it was perfectly good, but just for some reason, it just didn't do it.

1667
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
There's like different tiers of motherboards.

1668
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
They have different chip sets and you never want to get the lowest end chip set that's designed for like potatoes.

1669
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:17,000
If you want to do anything more advanced through the computer, you want to get at least a mid-range motherboard that has like decent capacitors and shit so it won't die on you instantly.

1670
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Tragic.

1671
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
It really is.

1672
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Just tragic.

1673
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Okay, voicemails.

1674
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I think it's time.

1675
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
All right.

1676
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
All right, we got them.

1677
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We ready?

1678
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Okay, hold on.

1679
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Let me get to fucking speak pipe.

1680
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Man, I should have skipped this back half of the podcast, not the first half.

1681
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
You're all floundering here and I am offering a way out.

1682
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm offering an escape from this and you're all treating me like I'm-

1683
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
If you don't want to go to voicemails, then just don't flounder.

1684
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Guns blazing with a great topic.

1685
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
All right, it was high energy.

1686
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Everybody loved it.

1687
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Yeah, it was a good-

1688
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
No, it was a good topic.

1689
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Hey, it was a good topic.

1690
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It was a good topic, but it's over.

1691
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It's time has passed.

1692
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
You got to live in the present.

1693
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I know.

1694
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
The present is voicemail.

1695
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
How unfortunate for us all.

1696
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It's true.

1697
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It's sad but true.

1698
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
The first one looks like this week is called Roger Roger.

1699
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Are we ready?

1700
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Yes.

1701
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Tom?

1702
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Yes.

1703
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yes, I'm ready.

1704
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Okay, Roger Roger.

1705
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Three, two, one, go.

1706
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Hey, guys.

1707
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
In the last episode, you were talking about maybe getting a 12th member.

1708
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
How about more logic, the Wonder Bread guy?

1709
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I mean, he's kind of a weirdo, but he's kind of a fun weirdo.

1710
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
He's got a good sense of energy to him.

1711
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I think it'd be a good fit.

1712
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I mean, if you want to, of course, if you want to, but I think it'd be a good thing.

1713
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Anybody call me back?

1714
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Call me back.

1715
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Never.

1716
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
That wasn't a Star Wars episode one battle droid reference.

1717
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'm very upset.

1718
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
No, like what's up with the name?

1719
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I don't know.

1720
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Merlogic is my best friend and we go out for salads twice a week.

1721
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Next one is called Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

1722
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Three, two, one, go.

1723
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Fun fact.

1724
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Alec Robbins, AKA Mr. Boop is caught up on one piece.

1725
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
How about that?

1726
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
What's your excuse?

1727
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Damn.

1728
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Okay.

1729
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
That is embarrassing.

1730
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
That is embarrassing.

1731
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I can't.

1732
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I want to be like Alec.

1733
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Okay.

1734
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
There's more reason than ever to catch up, I guess.

1735
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Next one is called intro three, two, one, go.

1736
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Y'all look, I'm supposed to be working right now.

1737
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Yeah.

1738
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1739
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
No, I ain't working.

1740
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Shit.

1741
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I'm doing nothing.

1742
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Damn.

1743
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
My dick.

1744
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I'm jerking and myself.

1745
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I'm sucking.

1746
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Oh, I am an asshole.

1747
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Damn.

1748
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You are a stupid.

1749
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Damn.

1750
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I got a deadline, but don't want to do it.

1751
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I mean, pretty good.

1752
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Not a lot of production on that.

1753
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Needed musical accompaniment to really sell it.

1754
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Needed musical accompaniment.

1755
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yeah.

1756
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I don't know.

1757
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Maybe just a little clap, like clap it along.

1758
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Maybe just clap those cheeks along with it.

1759
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1760
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Hey, send me some, hey, send me some twerking videos.

1761
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Don't say that.

1762
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Who, who was the, was it Onision who like asked, asked people for twerking videos?

1763
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Was it pyrocynical?

1764
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I think it was onision.

1765
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I don't know.

1766
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
No, Onision was the one who like had the like underage roommate that like him and his wife

1767
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
or husband were having sex with.

1768
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Well, I didn't need to know about that.

1769
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Now I do though.

1770
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Who was the one who was asked for twerking videos?

1771
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It doesn't matter.

1772
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Bad people.

1773
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I saw the video about it.

1774
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It wasn't, I don't know, whatever.

1775
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Who cares?

1776
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Next one is called Greg.

1777
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Three, two, one, go.

1778
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:17,000
The lesson in all of this is to never trust a woman to deliver a man's lecture.

1779
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Lol.

1780
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
True.

1781
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Sad but true.

1782
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
That's just, that's just biological.

1783
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
That's just genes.

1784
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You know.

1785
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Am I right?

1786
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Am I right guys?

1787
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Can I get a high five?

1788
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Can I get a high five here?

1789
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Under duress.

1790
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Oh, okay.

1791
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That often high five where you're just like, ugh.

1792
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I must mention that I've been delivered a burger and I am eating it.

1793
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
What the fuck?

1794
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Gusting.

1795
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
How did you do that?

1796
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
How could it be?

1797
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Last night, I was really craving chicken.

1798
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I caved and I bought some buffalo chicken and I ate it.

1799
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I went a little over my, I went a little over my calorie restrictions just because I really wanted that sweet, sweet wings over.

1800
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I almost had bad food yesterday, but I resisted.

1801
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I went to D&D, it was really fun.

1802
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I threw a fireball at seven cultists and they all died at the same time.

1803
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
It felt great.

1804
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That's pretty good.

1805
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Nice aim.

1806
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Nice aim.

1807
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It was a good hit.

1808
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Rolled high.

1809
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Good damage.

1810
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
33 points of fire damage on one fireball.

1811
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Oh, wow.

1812
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
They must not have made their reflex saves.

1813
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Only one did, but then I immediately killed him next round.

1814
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It was great.

1815
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
It was a good time.

1816
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Okay.

1817
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Excellent.

1818
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I'm glad.

1819
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Next one is called, I recorded this in my car and people near me heard it.

1820
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Three, two, one, go.

1821
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Like an absolute fiend.

1822
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Pump that crocodile right into the base of my cock.

1823
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I'm like Arnold Schwarzenegger and pumping iron.

1824
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Cause every time I play risk of rain two, I'm coming.

1825
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Just like I'm coming over to your house to give you that companionship you so freshly deserve.

1826
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
On this cold, dark nights when you cry out for the warmth of a woman's touch.

1827
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You know what I was doing?

1828
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Getting fucking cracked on the stage with my boys in risk of rain two.

1829
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I didn't like risk of rain one.

1830
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I don't know if two is good.

1831
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
He made a compelling argument.

1832
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Risk of rain two.

1833
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
That bit about the woman's touch was very, very compelling.

1834
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Risk of rain two, I think is in three Ds, three dimensional games, completely different.

1835
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
So maybe.

1836
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
What?

1837
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Yeah.

1838
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I was surprised.

1839
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I was like, they made risk of rain.

1840
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
You just platforming side to side.

1841
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Survival game?

1842
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
They should have saved that for risk of rain three.

1843
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Risk of rain three D.

1844
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
When are they going to make a risk of rain?

1845
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Rogue like third person shooter.

1846
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Oh, wow.

1847
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Okay.

1848
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
That sounds pretty cool.

1849
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
But I mean, I'm a little hesitant because I thought the original risk of rain sounded really cool.

1850
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And then I played it and I thought it was bad.

1851
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So I might look into it.

1852
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I might look into it and check it out.

1853
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Okay.

1854
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Came out late last year.

1855
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
No.

1856
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
No, it came out in early 2019.

1857
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
This is old.

1858
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
This game is old as fuck.

1859
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Okay.

1860
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I'll look into it.

1861
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Might be cool.

1862
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,000
From now on, Ben will only play games that came out after Noida, which unfortunately

1863
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
means he forfeits Minesweeper by default.

1864
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
That's true.

1865
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
It's too old.

1866
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
It's too old.

1867
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's just not relevant to the young people these days.

1868
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
People these days don't care about Minecraft.

1869
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
They're all about Picross.

1870
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Next voicemail is called soon.

1871
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Three, two, one, go.

1872
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Hello, Benjamin.

1873
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
That's me.

1874
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I am in the process of acquiring a certain picture from three men in Aqours, Georgia.

1875
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Do you know what that picture is been?

1876
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yes.

1877
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
It is that picture.

1878
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That picture which you have tried to hide from us all these years.

1879
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Picture of three men.

1880
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That picture of your butthole, a gape, so supple and so inviting.

1881
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Yes, Ben, soon, very soon.

1882
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Dude, I'm trying to eat.

1883
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I will have seen your butthole.

1884
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
You could have just asked.

1885
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Three men in Aqours, Georgia.

1886
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
What does that have to do with my butthole?

1887
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I don't understand.

1888
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I don't understand.

1889
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Listen, if you find it, Godspeed.

1890
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Next one is called I Have DLC.

1891
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Three, two, one, go.

1892
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
The whole big lip controversy is fucking stupid.

1893
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Do people seriously think that black people are the only ones in the world with big lips?

1894
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I'm an Asian guy and I have huge lips.

1895
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I've been made fun of it my entire life, but I'm not going to cancel people on Twitter

1896
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
just because they want to draw big lip characters.

1897
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I don't find it offensive, nor is it meant to be offensive.

1898
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's the whole same thing with lollies.

1899
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
There are petite women in the world, too.

1900
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Are you just going to deny these people's existence just because it doesn't gel with your own personal tastes

1901
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
or you just want to be some moral guardian?

1902
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
People who just want to get offended on behalf of everyone, you're actually disgusting

1903
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
because you're not doing this for the sake of other people.

1904
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You're just doing it to make yourself feel better

1905
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,000
and you need to fucking stop because it is actual cancer.

1906
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
No one was really getting canceled over it, though, is the thing.

1907
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
No, it just been.

1908
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah, just me.

1909
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
It really wasn't a big deal.

1910
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
That's why I'm like, eh, what was even the point?

1911
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
What was the point?

1912
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't think that it equates so well to lolly stuff, though.

1913
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I don't really think that's really...

1914
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
That's kind of apples and oranges, too.

1915
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah.

1916
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Some of them are just women who are small.

1917
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
He said lollies, but then he was describing adult petite women.

1918
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Adult petite women.

1919
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So he's conflating some things.

1920
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Absolutely.

1921
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Lollies that are supposed to be cute.

1922
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
To be fair, people do conflate those on the time on Twitter anyway.

1923
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Children.

1924
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Sure, whatever.

1925
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I mean, I think if you're drawing, if the character is an adult,

1926
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
even if they're small, then they're not a lolly, right?

1927
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Or is a lolly just an aesthetic and how they look?

1928
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I'm not entirely sure, honestly.

1929
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Okay, whatever.

1930
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Whatever.

1931
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Next one is two deaf punkers pitch about a weekend at Bernie's.

1932
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Three, two, one, go.

1933
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
There we go.

1934
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Did you catch the question?

1935
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I'm not going to lie, my brain completely ignored all of that.

1936
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:52,000
It was a little difficult to grasp what the words were.

1937
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I don't know.

1938
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Something happened.

1939
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
There's a shark involved.

1940
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I sure hope the shark's okay.

1941
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Once it goes to shore, we'll know for sure.

1942
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Were there any reason for...

1943
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I can't hear the last word.

1944
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I'm sorry.

1945
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I'm sorry.

1946
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I couldn't make it out.

1947
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I didn't feel terrible.

1948
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
But I can't do it.

1949
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I'm doomed.

1950
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I'm doomed.

1951
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Nice flow, though, as always.

1952
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Next voicemail is called a desperate plea.

1953
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Three, two, one, go.

1954
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Release me.

1955
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
You.

1956
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Release me.

1957
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
No.

1958
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
No, definitely not.

1959
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
This bondage.

1960
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I am trapped.

1961
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Oh, good.

1962
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Monty.

1963
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Betray us.

1964
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Turn his back on us.

1965
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Easy.

1966
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Just listen to yourself.

1967
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Nothing could be simpler.

1968
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Okay.

1969
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I don't know.

1970
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I think if Monty betrays people like that,

1971
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
it reflects well on him as a person.

1972
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Thanks for the voicemail.

1973
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Next one is called investments.

1974
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Three, two, one, go.

1975
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Hey, PCP, you get a lot of financial advice lately,

1976
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
but it's really boring, so I want you to consider this.

1977
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
An investment, right?

1978
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It's something that you set aside and it comes back stronger.

1979
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Literal definition, right?

1980
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Stock market is gambling and a distraction from the real shit.

1981
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Let me give you this first tip, diversity.

1982
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Feel like you missed out on Bitcoin or GME,

1983
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
early Google, those golden gooses.

1984
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Well, don't be, because you don't have a crystal ball.

1985
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
You can't know if that shit's going to explode.

1986
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
What you do know is that over time,

1987
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
stocks rise and fall while the market always grows.

1988
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Don't bother searching for that needle.

1989
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Just buy the haystack.

1990
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Diversity.

1991
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Secondly, you want to get a Roth IRA and cap it yearly.

1992
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
M1 Finance is a good service for this.

1993
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Consider you put in 6K a year into one of these accounts

1994
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
for 30 years.

1995
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Once you put in about 180K with proper investments

1996
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
and diversity, your total is going to be at around

1997
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
a million dollars for doing fucking nothing.

1998
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Once you're 60 years old, you can withdraw from this account

1999
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
tax-free and live a good life.

2000
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
If you need money short-term, this is, of course, less useful,

2001
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
but if you have 6K a year, you can put aside

2002
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and don't expect to die before you're 60, this is what you want.

2003
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I have a Roth IRA.

2004
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I didn't cap it last year.

2005
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I'm like stunned at just like the extreme change in tone

2006
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
when someone who actually has a brain between their ears

2007
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
speaks on the show.

2008
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I'm like, whoa, where am I?

2009
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I'm afraid.

2010
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I need an adult.

2011
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
But the adult left the voicemail.

2012
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
He didn't say it into an auto-tuner though.

2013
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
How am I supposed to take this seriously?

2014
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
You know that's fair.

2015
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
He wasn't playing the piano.

2016
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
This is, I mean, the diversity thing, like that's similar

2017
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:37,000
to the index fund thing that Doublecast said.

2018
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
This is great advice, but I make less than 6K a year total.

2019
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
So I'm very polling.

2020
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
How do you make less than 6K a year total?

2021
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Because I make $300 a month on Patreon, like $200 a month on this show.

2022
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Add that up times 12.

2023
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's what I make per year.

2024
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Tragic, tragic.

2025
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:06,000
The index fund, well, the index fund is just a single fund

2026
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
that is tied to the market.

2027
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Diversifying is like different, but similar.

2028
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I mean, that's pretty much what Minerva said,

2029
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
was the market always grows and an index fund is like how you get in on that.

2030
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I have been saying that I want to do that for like months now,

2031
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
and I have not actually got, not months, a month, a month and a half.

2032
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I don't know, sounds reasonable.

2033
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Thanks, Mr. Investments.

2034
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
The next voicemail is called Kringus Real.

2035
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Three, two, one, go.

2036
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Oi, basically, it's me, your friend, Kringus Abengus.

2037
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Oh, there he is.

2038
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I know that voice anywhere.

2039
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I wanted to talk all about Kring and bugging that this week.

2040
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
But first, I want to bring this up.

2041
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Someone called in on the voicemails pretending to be me,

2042
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and how do you fall for that?

2043
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I don't know, how did that happen?

2044
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You're a smart guy.

2045
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I just was so caught up in the need of the moment.

2046
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
But it is not a big deal.

2047
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I just, I was hurt a little bit by it.

2048
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Listen, if you could just, just listen to me like,

2049
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I apologize.

2050
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
What if I send you a mini French?

2051
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Let me get to my week.

2052
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
This week, oh man, let me tell you,

2053
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I cringed so hard at the US government.

2054
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I cannot believe what they're up to.

2055
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It's crazy.

2056
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's real bad.

2057
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Anyway, are you suggesting that this is not the Kringus bingus?

2058
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
That we know and love?

2059
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I can't tell for sure.

2060
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It's fantastic.

2061
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
That's a serious accusation.

2062
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
It's pretty great.

2063
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
That's what I did this week.

2064
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I'll tell you what I cringed and bugging that next week.

2065
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
So keep it up.

2066
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
He said it again.

2067
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Kringus bingus, a pleasure as always to hear from you.

2068
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,000
You are a light at the end of a dark tunnel of each week

2069
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
of being a member of the PCB.

2070
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Right now I'm doing the Philip J. Fry shifty eyes look face.

2071
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:18,000
That's slander and libel that you would make that face

2072
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
even in private.

2073
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Well, sue me.

2074
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Do it.

2075
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
The court, the court, the court, the court will hear the case

2076
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
of Kringus bingus versus give and take.

2077
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
All, all rise.

2078
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Okay.

2079
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Next voicemail is called the monopoly man.

2080
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Three, two, one, go.

2081
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

2082
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Here's the monopoly man.

2083
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Oh, I love money.

2084
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It's me.

2085
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
What do I also love?

2086
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Bribing politicians.

2087
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
If you're in the league of Nate Fockers, send a voicemail

2088
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
and become president.

2089
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I will sponsor you with 2000 Dutch coin.

2090
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:10,000
This is 2000 Dutch coin for the best voicemail.

2091
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Ho, ho, ho.

2092
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
This was the monopoly man.

2093
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Okay.

2094
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Humble beginnings of a new character.

2095
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
What's dogecoin at right now?

2096
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Is it, is he saying dogecoin?

2097
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
A little under six cents, or at least it was.

2098
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Uh, yeah.

2099
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Oh, it's kind of just, it's kind of just hung around at like 50.

2100
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yeah, it's up to, it's up to a little under six cents.

2101
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
So 2000.

2102
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:46,000
So what is, what is 2000 dogecoin worth?

2103
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It's worth about, that's about $100.

2104
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
What, wait a minute.

2105
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
What the fuck?

2106
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I just went to Google calculator and there's like a,

2107
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
a sparkly little pie symbol that you can press.

2108
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
It's because it's pie day.

2109
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It's March 14th.

2110
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Oh, yeah.

2111
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Oh, it's like a little like game or something where like it types pie in for you.

2112
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Uh, one, four, one, five, nine, two, six.

2113
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Did I get it right?

2114
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
One, four, four, one, five.

2115
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I know all the digits of pie.

2116
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Oh, it like, it wants you to type the rest of the digits and it will like give you a little like red button if you hit the wrong one.

2117
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Okay.

2118
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Very cute.

2119
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Very cute Google.

2120
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The digits of pie are 3.12.

2121
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Prove it.

2122
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Nope.

2123
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Okay.

2124
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Yeah.

2125
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Yeah.

2126
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Okay.

2127
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Next voicemail is called pick cross at work.

2128
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Three, two, one.

2129
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Wait, wait, wait.

2130
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I don't see that one.

2131
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's on the next page.

2132
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You don't?

2133
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah.

2134
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh, lol.

2135
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
We got more of these.

2136
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
We got more of these.

2137
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Three, two, one.

2138
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Go.

2139
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Gib, what do you like do in pick cross when it's a square that you have to guess to solve?

2140
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Like it's either each corner or the other corner.

2141
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Like you lose.

2142
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I can't get my dick hard when I'm forecasting at work and I just can't do these puzzles.

2143
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Damn.

2144
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
What do I do?

2145
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:34,000
The unfortunate reality is that with a randomly generated puzzle of pick cross you stand to

2146
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
sometimes have to guess and it sucks when you do.

2147
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Just like minecraft.

2148
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I've gotten mine sweeper.

2149
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Mine sweeper.

2150
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Mine sweeper.

2151
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Mine sweeper.

2152
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Mine sweeper.

2153
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You mean?

2154
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Minecraft.

2155
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:57,700
Like you just play the game and then you get right to the end of a 25 by 25 pick cross board.

2156
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:03,000
You've done everything perfectly and it took like three hours, not three hours, but like

2157
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
a while to think about all the numbers involved and then there was swirling around your head

2158
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
and you were thinking like, ah, squares and numbers.

2159
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,920
This is very intellectual.

2160
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:13,920
And then you get right to the end.

2161
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,600
You have to make a coin flip.

2162
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,200
You fail and you just die.

2163
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,200
That's what happens.

2164
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,200
That's what you do.

2165
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,200
Beautiful.

2166
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,200
Beautiful.

2167
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,200
Inspirational.

2168
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:30,640
This is why Sudoku is the only like perfect one, but it is a little, you know, I'm tired

2169
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,640
of Sudoku.

2170
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,640
I'm too good at it.

2171
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:35,560
Because there's no, because there's no guessing in Sudoku.

2172
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:36,640
There's never any guessing.

2173
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:44,200
If it's, I mean, I think it's impossible to make a Sudoku that can be like fucked up

2174
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,560
because all the numbers have to fit.

2175
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,560
Yeah.

2176
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:52,880
This is why Pokemon, the competitive Pokemon is the ultimate sport because there's never

2177
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,400
any random chance.

2178
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,760
There's never any guessing.

2179
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:02,240
The winner is always the better player 100% of the time.

2180
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:06,400
Stone edge always hits and that's just a fact.

2181
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:09,320
Next one is called riches beyond your wildest dreams.

2182
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,520
Three, two, one, go.

2183
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,520
All right.

2184
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,080
I gave this a little more thought about that financial advice I was giving earlier and

2185
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:16,320
I realized it's bad, disregarded.

2186
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:17,320
Oh, shit.

2187
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,320
Here's the thing.

2188
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,320
Here's the real advice.

2189
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,840
No one comes to this fucking podcast for financial advice.

2190
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:27,160
They come here to hear Ben St. talk about how he lost a million dollars again every

2191
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,160
single week.

2192
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,280
So I wasted my time.

2193
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:31,280
I wasted your time.

2194
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,280
I wasted all of our time.

2195
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,280
I'm very sorry.

2196
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:35,280
He should be.

2197
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,280
Fuck you.

2198
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,280
Fuck you.

2199
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,360
He's trying to ruin the podcast.

2200
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,640
He's trying to ruin the podcast by making me financially solvent.

2201
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:47,800
You see a future in your mind's eye of like Ben St. saying, ah, yes, my index fund, my

2202
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:51,320
special money thingy has made me more money.

2203
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,320
Haha.

2204
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,640
My 401k is taken off.

2205
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,640
Yes.

2206
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,640
Everything's going up.

2207
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,640
No house for me.

2208
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,640
Ben St.

2209
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,640
My money's doing great.

2210
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:06,000
How am I supposed to guilt people into giving me another mini fridge?

2211
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,480
I earned that mini fridge.

2212
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,960
I earned that mini fridge by achieving the end.

2213
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,640
By achieving the end of Noida, all those hundreds of hours I've put into Noida, we're

2214
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:20,080
just training to win that mini fridge from Chalupa Coon.

2215
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:25,040
Doing the math, you made like 16 cents an hour earning that mini fridge for all the

2216
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,720
hours you put into Noida.

2217
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:29,520
But you know what they say?

2218
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,520
You work, do what you love and you never work a day in your life.

2219
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,280
And for me, that's playing Noida for a mini fridge.

2220
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,160
So jokes on them.

2221
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:44,040
Next voicemail is from Ren, three, two, one, go.

2222
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:48,080
Do I have a speech impediment or are microphones just fed?

2223
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:52,480
This thing costs 70 EU credits and I still don't recognize my voice.

2224
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,480
It's like a stranger, we call it this.

2225
01:57:54,480 --> 01:58:00,960
And neither my neighbors nor the traffic in front of the house are helping.

2226
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,840
If by speech impediment, you mean your German accent, then yes.

2227
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:11,000
You kind of sound like you have a lisp and that could be the microphone.

2228
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
So I don't know.

2229
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,280
How does a microphone create a lisp?

2230
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,520
I don't know.

2231
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,000
Maybe just made it sound fuzzy.

2232
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Yeah.

2233
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,640
Well, he said he seemed to be suggesting that he does not have a speech impediment and yet

2234
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,560
he sounds like he does in the microphone.

2235
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:32,680
And he did kind of sound like he had a bit of a lisp, which is that maybe that's what

2236
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:34,880
he's talking about with the microphone.

2237
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:37,760
Or maybe he just has one and he's just in denial about it.

2238
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,320
I just don't know.

2239
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:43,000
It could also be the recording location if there's cars driving by and you're like noise

2240
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,120
removing that would fuck up a little bit of stuff, deleting noise removal can fuck

2241
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,120
you up.

2242
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,920
Scrubbing data from it.

2243
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:59,240
Try recording inside of a closet where there's dampening clothing.

2244
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:04,480
Try put that like foam egg crates up all of your walls to suck up the extra noise.

2245
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:07,360
Make a pillow for it and record in there.

2246
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:14,040
Record at midnight when you can scream as loud as you want and wake your parents up.

2247
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:17,680
The only time where you can scream as loud as you want is when you will get in trouble

2248
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,680
for it.

2249
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:23,080
Got to live on the edge.

2250
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:28,480
Next voicemail is called cross browser extensions three, two, one, go.

2251
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,720
What are some browser extensions that you use and that you think everyone should use?

2252
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:33,720
None.

2253
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:41,000
Well, I have an ad block and that's the only one that I feel strongly about.

2254
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,280
Oh, no, wait, I have two that I can recommend.

2255
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:50,400
First one is sponsor block for YouTube.

2256
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,920
It's a great extension.

2257
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:57,040
If you're sick of hearing ads for RAID Shadow Legends, this is like a crowd aggregate thing

2258
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,520
where they'll automatically mark where sponsor segments are in YouTube videos and automatically

2259
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,520
skip them.

2260
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,960
Super great.

2261
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,640
That's actually based.

2262
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,640
Sponsor block.

2263
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,640
Super good.

2264
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,000
The other one, better Twitter.

2265
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,400
You can block retweets, you can block ads, you can block all those things and just get

2266
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:19,520
all the bullshit out of your Twitter feed so it's just original content from the people

2267
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,600
you follow, which is why I'm there in the first place.

2268
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,760
Holy shit, that's so good.

2269
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:27,760
That's super good.

2270
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,760
Okay.

2271
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,440
I'm tempted by that one.

2272
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:36,240
Aside from ad block is speed dial, which is just like when you open a new tab, there's

2273
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:42,720
like all of the websites you frequent in like a little grid and you just click on them.

2274
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,640
I've actually used it that much recently though.

2275
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:50,920
I've taken to like opening a new tab and then typing the first letter of the website I want

2276
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:53,040
to go to and then it auto completes.

2277
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,040
Yeah.

2278
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:58,440
Like if I type why it goes to YouTube.

2279
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:05,360
So really nothing, get nothing, get what Tom said.

2280
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:13,320
Did you guys see that like they're making another Simpsons episode that changes Homer's

2281
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,800
teenage years?

2282
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,360
I was just looking at a tweet.

2283
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:17,360
They moved.

2284
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,360
Okay.

2285
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:19,360
They've moved it up.

2286
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:27,160
This is the current year the Simpsons were born in, Homer 1985, Marge 1987, Bart 2011,

2287
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:33,480
Lisa 2013, Maggie 2020.

2288
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:37,680
God is dead and we need to die too.

2289
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:43,720
So I remember there was like a when we were young Simpsons where it's like Homer Marge

2290
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:46,800
and they're listening to Nirvana and it's the nineties or whatever.

2291
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,800
Yeah.

2292
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,800
That was the most recent.

2293
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,800
So they already did this once.

2294
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,800
Is there another one?

2295
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:51,800
Like new one.

2296
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:52,800
There's a new one.

2297
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,800
Yeah, there's a new one.

2298
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:54,800
Yeah.

2299
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:55,800
Are they playing Minecraft?

2300
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:56,800
What are they doing?

2301
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,800
Well, I mean, it would be in the nineties.

2302
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,240
So no, it wouldn't be playing Minecraft, but like Homer's got like hip hop posters on his

2303
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:05,240
walls.

2304
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:14,080
He's got posters for the Humpty Dance and Naughty by Nature, which is fine, I guess.

2305
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:18,800
They should just go full insane and like implied that the Simpsons is now taking place in

2306
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:24,920
the future and like Homer and Marge were Zoomers.

2307
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,920
This is so bad.

2308
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,920
I don't know.

2309
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:35,360
Like fucking the whole like the Homer's mom's backstory like doesn't make any sense if she's

2310
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,440
not like a hippie.

2311
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,480
So like what the fuck is this?

2312
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,800
It's all not canon anymore.

2313
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,880
It's been uncannonized.

2314
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:52,600
The Simpsons is like a Abe Simpson is like is very is very like obviously like a greatest

2315
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,200
generation guy.

2316
02:02:54,200 --> 02:03:00,680
And now he's now he's like Gen X like fuck, no, it just doesn't work.

2317
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:03,080
It just doesn't work.

2318
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:04,080
I'm sorry.

2319
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:09,680
Simpsons right now is like if you copy paste something like a billion times like it loses.

2320
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:13,000
It's like it's sort of like a facsimile of the original thing, but it doesn't make any

2321
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
sense.

2322
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,240
And it's just sort of lost a lot of like JPEG artifacts all over it.

2323
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:22,400
You know that when you like copy a video, you download a video, you uploaded it like

2324
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,600
a hundred thousand times.

2325
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,640
It becomes like a weird blob.

2326
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:26,640
Oh, yeah.

2327
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:27,640
Sure.

2328
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,640
Yeah.

2329
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,320
It's like they it's like they think like we need to set.

2330
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:36,400
We need to change the time it's set in for it to continue to be relevant, but it's not

2331
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,400
relevant.

2332
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:43,440
I think there's the unfortunate thing about it is that it implies and it's probably true

2333
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:49,000
that people who watch the Simpsons on TV will not have time nor the inclination to watch

2334
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,500
all of the Simpsons.

2335
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,780
So why would we keep continuity?

2336
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:55,100
There's no reason.

2337
02:03:55,100 --> 02:04:01,180
And now now people may not have a reason to go back and watch the parts of the Simpsons

2338
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:02,180
that are good.

2339
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:06,580
I guess the whole point is that it's a parody on like modern family interactions.

2340
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:11,140
And so by having them be 20 years older than what an average family of their age is supposed

2341
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:13,540
to be, it loses relevance.

2342
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:17,580
But I feel like the Simpsons have been around so long, like they've kind of become characters

2343
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:21,860
in and of themselves and shifting them to match the current times almost feels like

2344
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:25,020
a betrayal of the legacy of the characters.

2345
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,500
I guess it's a fair question.

2346
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:32,940
Like who is the average viewer of like the new episodes of the Simpsons in twenty twenty

2347
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:33,940
one.

2348
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:39,780
And it probably is like it's probably not like people who have been watching since the early

2349
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,780
nineties.

2350
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:41,780
Yeah.

2351
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:43,740
It's a new audience watching the same show.

2352
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:49,580
And like there's so many episodes that there's it's like not a given thing that somebody

2353
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:53,140
who gets into the Simpsons will want to go back and watch everything.

2354
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:57,660
So they're not they're not treating it like it's something that needs to do that anymore.

2355
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:01,500
See, they should have just had Bart and Lisa grow up and they should be the main characters

2356
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,900
now as adults.

2357
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:06,700
And then we could have just had a continuing timeline of all these characters actually growing

2358
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:08,300
and changing and evolving.

2359
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:13,220
Well, well, that wouldn't be relatable because canonically Lisa grows up to become president

2360
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:17,180
and Bart grows up to become chief chief justice of the Supreme Court.

2361
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:18,980
So that would be like a really fucked up show.

2362
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:21,980
That'd be like the West Wing.

2363
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:22,980
We can't have.

2364
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,980
Damn.

2365
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:24,980
You got me.

2366
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:25,980
Yeah.

2367
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:26,980
Sorry.

2368
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:27,980
Sorry.

2369
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:28,980
I've owned you at Simpsons trivia.

2370
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:32,220
I wonder though because like I've seen like three episodes of the Simpsons so it's not

2371
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:33,220
hard to beat me.

2372
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:34,220
Really?

2373
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:35,220
Really?

2374
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,220
You haven't.

2375
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,220
That's fucked up.

2376
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:39,540
That's so fucked up.

2377
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:42,500
I was a big Simpsons head.

2378
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:48,820
I watched it all growing up until about until I went to college and then I pretty much fell

2379
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:49,820
off it.

2380
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:51,540
Which which episodes were they actually?

2381
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,820
Do you remember?

2382
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,820
What do you mean?

2383
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:56,220
The episodes that I've seen.

2384
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,220
Yeah.

2385
02:05:57,220 --> 02:06:02,420
I think I've seen the one where like everyone thinks Mr. Burns is an alien.

2386
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:03,420
That one was kind of cool.

2387
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,620
I remember that one sticking out in my brain a lot.

2388
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:06,620
Oh, yeah.

2389
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:07,620
Remember that one?

2390
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:11,860
The one with the Mulder and Scully guest stars, right?

2391
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:12,860
Maybe?

2392
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:14,460
It's been so fucking long.

2393
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,700
I watched these like at like 12, just like they happened to be on after like cartoons

2394
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:21,580
and I would just keep watching until my parents like this isn't for you and they would turn

2395
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:22,580
it off.

2396
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:23,580
Oh.

2397
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,580
God.

2398
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:25,580
Okay.

2399
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:28,380
I don't know if I even remember the specifics of any other ones.

2400
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:33,220
There's like one Krusty the Clown episode like I remember the itchy and scratchy show

2401
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:37,500
coming on a couple of times in some episodes, but I don't even remember the general context

2402
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:38,500
of these episodes.

2403
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,780
Just remember bits and pieces.

2404
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:46,900
Simpsons is like so good at it's like the reason it's gone on so long is because it

2405
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:51,580
had such a good string of seasons early on.

2406
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:57,540
So I would encourage anyone who's not gotten into the Simpsons to like try some earlier

2407
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,540
stuff.

2408
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:03,060
See if there's like a few because like as a as a teenager or an adult, there's so many

2409
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:09,100
things that are like clever funny jokes they pick up on for when you're a kid, maybe things

2410
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:10,580
would go over your head.

2411
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:15,460
Maybe you'd find the physical humor interesting like there's so many clever so much clever

2412
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:16,980
writing in there.

2413
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:18,900
It's really good.

2414
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:24,660
I watched a video earlier this week about it was a it was like a moderately big YouTube

2415
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:27,100
channel who people might have heard of.

2416
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:32,700
I don't remember, but it was he he he ranks every Simpsons episode like every single

2417
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:35,020
one like all 600 plus of them.

2418
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:38,540
He goes through each one in order and like gives his thoughts on them.

2419
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:41,660
And then at the end he ranks them.

2420
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:49,300
The channel was like LS something, whatever, it was like a pretty no, it wasn't like a Simpsons

2421
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,300
channel.

2422
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:55,740
It was just like a general like, like, like culture, like cartoon, culture, commentary

2423
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:56,740
channel.

2424
02:07:57,740 --> 02:08:06,540
Oh, hold on, ranking every Simpsons episode.

2425
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:12,620
It is the channel is, yeah, LS mark, who I'd never heard of before I saw this video just

2426
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:17,860
popped up in my recommends and I was like, that sounds like a good way to kill six hours.

2427
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:19,580
It's okay.

2428
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:21,620
I think I was working while I was listening to it.

2429
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:22,620
So it's fine.

2430
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:24,620
It was a decent video, though, it was good.

2431
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:25,620
I recommend it.

2432
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:28,340
I recommend it, but he gets he gets really fed up.

2433
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:31,580
He gets really fed up with the show.

2434
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:36,060
Probably even like earlier, like people say this show got bad around like season 10, but

2435
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:40,780
he's like, he's starting to get like fed up with its bullshit, even by season like, I

2436
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:45,380
don't know, like seven or eight, I think, lol.

2437
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:50,180
And then there's the end then there's like so much left to go after that and he like just

2438
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,180
hates it.

2439
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,860
It's pretty solid.

2440
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:56,540
Anything for the cloud.

2441
02:08:56,540 --> 02:08:57,540
Anything for the cloud.

2442
02:08:57,540 --> 02:09:00,540
I mean, it's a solid concept for a video.

2443
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:04,300
Wish I'd thought of it.

2444
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:08,420
You wouldn't have finished like you stopped for your Winnie the Pooh series.

2445
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:09,420
I did.

2446
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:11,220
I'm too much of a bitch.

2447
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:16,460
I should have made one big 10 hour video where I like ranking every episode of Winnie

2448
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:17,460
the Pooh.

2449
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:18,460
That's true.

2450
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,460
That's the way to do it.

2451
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,620
It probably would have been better for views.

2452
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:23,420
You could still do that, I guess.

2453
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:29,260
I still kind of intend to finish the at least season one of the Pooh videos just because

2454
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:31,260
I said I would.

2455
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:38,700
I don't know when I'll do it, but like maybe after I finish a couple other things, I said

2456
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:43,140
I would do it and I feel bad not having done something that I said I would do.

2457
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:47,820
So I might just bang some out at some point just just for the memes.

2458
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:48,940
I don't know.

2459
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:53,340
Every now and then I still get a comment or two on those videos and I'm like, how are

2460
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:55,260
they finding me?

2461
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:57,100
These are people that are completely removed.

2462
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,260
These are people I've never heard of before.

2463
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:00,340
They're not PCP viewers.

2464
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:01,660
They're not like Chris Chan people.

2465
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:05,100
They're just like, they're just some hardcore Winnie the Pooh fans who just like, I need

2466
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:08,740
some dank Winnie the Pooh content and they just find your shit.

2467
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,740
Where's that poo?

2468
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:10,740
Yeah.

2469
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:11,740
They're poo heads.

2470
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:12,740
I need that poo.

2471
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,740
Yeah.

2472
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:19,220
I mean, I guess that's why I made the videos is to get people like that.

2473
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:22,860
But like it didn't, since I got so few of them, whenever one pops up in my comments,

2474
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:23,860
I'm like, really?

2475
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:24,860
Really?

2476
02:10:24,860 --> 02:10:25,860
You're here?

2477
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:26,860
Why?

2478
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:27,860
No.

2479
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:28,860
You're all alone.

2480
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:29,860
Yeah.

2481
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:30,860
Yeah.

2482
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:32,380
I like Winnie the Pooh.

2483
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,380
Yeah.

2484
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,380
I'm Gen X.

2485
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:37,380
We exist.

2486
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:42,580
Next voicemail, by the way, is called spiral three, two, one, go.

2487
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:48,780
Do you guys know the name of the ice type gym leader from Diamond and Pearl?

2488
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,620
I can't remember her name.

2489
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:51,620
From Diamond.

2490
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,620
Help me out.

2491
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:55,380
Ice cream.

2492
02:10:55,380 --> 02:11:00,780
Weird that you confused our voicemails for Google.

2493
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:03,300
Wait, there's got to be some joke here.

2494
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:05,980
There's got to be a joke, right?

2495
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:06,980
Let's see.

2496
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:09,540
Ice type gym leader.

2497
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:10,540
What's Gen 4?

2498
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:11,540
Is it Hoenn?

2499
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:12,540
Yeah.

2500
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:13,540
No, no.

2501
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:14,540
That's Gen 3.

2502
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,540
No.

2503
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:16,540
No?

2504
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,540
What?

2505
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,540
It's Sinnoh, right?

2506
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:23,460
Sinnoh's Gen 4?

2507
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:26,060
Oh, okay.

2508
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:28,340
It's Candice.

2509
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:32,820
It's the gym leader of Snowpoint City's Gym, officially known as the Snowpoint Gym.

2510
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:35,780
Her name is Candice.

2511
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:38,060
It's got an ice pun in there.

2512
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:39,060
Great.

2513
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:40,060
I guess.

2514
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:42,100
That's what a voicemail fucker.

2515
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:49,060
If he had titled the thing nuts, it'd be like Candice nuts, like Candice nuts.

2516
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,580
I don't know.

2517
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:51,580
I don't know what he was going for.

2518
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,580
Maybe.

2519
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:53,580
Fail.

2520
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:54,580
Epic.

2521
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:55,580
Yeah.

2522
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,580
Epic fail.

2523
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:59,300
Next voicemail is called Advice for Custodian Bro.

2524
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:01,460
Three, two, one, go.

2525
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:08,340
If you're looking for a new direction in life, maybe a new line of work, if you have low education,

2526
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:15,580
low skills, I would definitely recommend looking for employment in a bar or a restaurant

2527
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:18,300
as a server, a waiter, a waitress.

2528
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:25,060
Well, this advice doesn't work for everyone, but I can tell you that being a server in

2529
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:27,540
a restaurant is actually a great job.

2530
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:31,100
It's one of the few jobs where your boomer parents' advice of knocking doors and shaking

2531
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:33,700
hands actually fucking works.

2532
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:37,860
Get a haircut, groom yourself as best you can, put on a shirt with buttons and some

2533
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:43,180
nice jeans, and then literally walk into every restaurant in your area.

2534
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:46,980
Ask someone there for the manager, and then ask the manager if they're hiring.

2535
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:50,820
Give them a resume and fill out the application, and I can almost promise by the end of the

2536
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:53,740
week you will have a job.

2537
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:58,940
Being a server, it can be tough work, but it's easy to pick up and learn, and you can

2538
02:12:58,940 --> 02:12:59,940
make good money.

2539
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:03,580
The nicer the restaurant you work at, the more money you make, so walk into the nice

2540
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:04,700
ones first.

2541
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:08,980
Walk into your fucking local PF chains or whatever.

2542
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:12,560
Then once you're in there, ask if you can move into the bar.

2543
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,860
You can bar back to start and then move into bartender.

2544
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:22,980
I was bartending with low education, low skills, and I was clearing easily $1,000 a week because

2545
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:26,180
I was in a good spot.

2546
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:27,180
Just something to try.

2547
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:30,500
Hopefully, that works out for you for anyone looking for a new job.

2548
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,500
Good luck.

2549
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:40,180
This is ... I mean, I guess it's true that maybe someone might want to change things

2550
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:45,220
up for themselves and get a new job and stop being a custodian and become a restaurant

2551
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,220
server.

2552
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:48,300
Maybe, but that's such basic advice.

2553
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:52,820
Like, oh, if you're looking for a job, walk into restaurants and ask if they're hiring.

2554
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:55,020
Yeah.

2555
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:58,980
Maybe it's so obvious that it bears repeating just because some people wouldn't think of

2556
02:13:58,980 --> 02:13:59,980
it, I guess.

2557
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:03,060
That seems like basic advice to me.

2558
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:04,500
Yeah, sometimes what people need.

2559
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,700
I'm not impressed.

2560
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:07,700
I guess so.

2561
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:14,340
I mean, I think I would hate to be a bartender, but I'm sure for some people it's a great

2562
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:18,660
job, but they would enjoy a lot, so whatever.

2563
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:26,020
I'm bad with people, so I'm glad that I studied the arts and I could maybe do that instead.

2564
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:33,780
Something that allows me to avoid talking to people is good.

2565
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:37,980
Additional advice, this next one is called Additional Advice, three, two, one, go.

2566
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:41,780
And if you're sitting there thinking, oh no, I don't have any experience with that, there's

2567
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:43,700
no way a place will hire me.

2568
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:49,620
I promise you, a ton of people, their first job is being a waiter in a restaurant.

2569
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:55,300
If you've been a custodian and are working 12-hour days, every single restaurant manager

2570
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,420
will want to hire you.

2571
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:02,500
It means that you are willing to work hard, you can take orders, and you're not afraid

2572
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:07,060
to do gross things to get a job done, which sometimes as a server, you have to do when

2573
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:10,100
you have to do extra cleaning and clean bathrooms and shit.

2574
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:14,860
I feel like this guy is assuming a lot, this guy seems really confident that the custodian

2575
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:19,580
guy would much prefer to work in a restaurant than to be a custodian, and I don't think

2576
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:20,580
that's necessarily true.

2577
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:24,180
So you can make new friends and you can potentially find a roommate there.

2578
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:26,460
You can get you out of your parent's house.

2579
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:31,660
Also regulars at the bar and restaurant, if you're there long enough, you get to know

2580
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:32,820
them.

2581
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:36,980
I've had plenty of job offers come from regulars, I come into my restaurants and bars.

2582
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:42,500
So you can pursue other options off of that, you don't have to be a tip slave for the rest

2583
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:44,660
of your life if you don't want to be either.

2584
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:48,020
Good luck out there, man, it's tough, but I know you can do it, I know you can make a

2585
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:49,580
better life for yourself.

2586
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:52,780
You're working hard right now, you just got to put that hard work in a slightly different

2587
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:53,780
direction.

2588
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:55,380
You got this.

2589
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:00,980
Okay, the thing about working in a restaurant, like you need more people, that was like

2590
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:04,380
surprising me uplifting at the end, I was like, whoa.

2591
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:06,180
I guess he has a point there.

2592
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:13,780
Yeah, I mean, it may be obvious, but sometimes you just go through life and you miss all

2593
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:17,580
the obvious advice, and then you just don't know what to do.

2594
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:21,420
I mean, when you're in your own shit, it's hard to see out of it.

2595
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:27,820
This voicemail is called A Request, A Recommendation, 3, 2, 1, go.

2596
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:33,820
Despite the current state of the PCP, you guys should still do some extracurricular PCP

2597
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:38,900
video game content, whether it be a pick, cross race, or a minesweeper game of attrition.

2598
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:42,220
Even if it is just Ben, Gib, and Tom, it would be fun to watch.

2599
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:48,860
Ben, you like roguelikes, you should play Tower Climb, Gay Rights, Trans Rights, BLM,

2600
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:51,020
AKF, you get it just.

2601
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:52,620
Cool.

2602
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:55,220
Tower Climb, I've never heard of that.

2603
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:57,980
I wonder what you do in it.

2604
02:16:57,980 --> 02:17:00,020
Is it the opposite of Downwell?

2605
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,020
Hmm.

2606
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:04,460
All right, I got the Steam page up.

2607
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:07,460
It's the sequel to Downwell, Tower Climb.

2608
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:13,660
A roguelike platformer, five years in the making.

2609
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:19,060
I mean, from first glance, yeah, it looks like the kind of game I would enjoy, so how

2610
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:20,660
much does it cost?

2611
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:25,660
$15, highway robbery.

2612
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,660
Even Noida was only 10.

2613
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:31,660
Wait, no, Noida was 20, lol.

2614
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:37,700
All right, I'll put it on my wishlist.

2615
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:38,700
Next voice.

2616
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:43,060
Wait, as for gaming content, I mean, is it spoiler to say we're going to do the Minecraft

2617
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:44,060
thing?

2618
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:46,500
I mean, the minesweeper thing?

2619
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,500
We've already said it.

2620
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,500
I think it's...

2621
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:49,500
Oh, okay.

2622
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:52,500
We're going to do a both episode minesweeper.

2623
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:54,500
Minesweeper challenge, challenge run.

2624
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:58,860
Who's going to blow things up?

2625
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:01,260
Who's going to blow up on social media?

2626
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:04,180
Who's going to get viral?

2627
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:06,180
Who's going to get coronavirus?

2628
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:10,060
All of these questions are one or the other.

2629
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:19,100
Okay, next voicemail is called folk punk album recommendations, three, two, one, go.

2630
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:23,820
People who eat people are the luckiest people in the world, rogue taxidermy, death and hatred

2631
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:30,940
to mankind, the city isn't big enough, probably nothing, possibly everything, gay rights,

2632
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:33,020
but that's not an album recommendation.

2633
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:36,580
Okay, thanks for the album recommendations.

2634
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:42,580
I've never listened to folk punk, but I will probably forget everything you just said.

2635
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:46,060
Is folk punk like go go bordello?

2636
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:53,060
It's probably just the aesthetic of punk, but without the electricity, acoustic guitar.

2637
02:18:53,060 --> 02:19:04,700
I think it's probably punk rock, but with an aesthetic tinged with some kind of flavor

2638
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:13,620
of some kind of folk musical tradition or something, go go bordello is the one that

2639
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:14,620
jumps to mind.

2640
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:24,300
It's like that music, like the ukulele with a xylophone, like ding ding ding, happy advertisement

2641
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:32,220
friendly corporate bullshit, but then there's a guy screaming like fuck everything.

2642
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:36,020
Like Borat, bing bong bing bong bing, right?

2643
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:38,220
Yeah, exactly like that.

2644
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:41,220
Yeah, nice.

2645
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:44,020
I've never heard of any of those albums, lol.

2646
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:50,820
Okay, next voicemail is called Trying If This Shit Works, 3, 2, 1, go.

2647
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:59,300
You're a fucking criminal.

2648
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:01,020
You're a fucking criminal, you know that?

2649
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:03,380
It's literally just a test.

2650
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:06,020
Voice jail, voice jail, voice jail.

2651
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:10,100
This is serious business, you're fucking it up, you're fucking up everything.

2652
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:15,300
Oh my god, we have so many more to go and that wasted 30 seconds of my day.

2653
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:19,660
There's not that many, there's like 100, nah, okay, we're good.

2654
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:22,780
Next one is called Fuck'em, 3, 2, 1, go.

2655
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:28,580
Okay, Ben, I just checked out the Twitter account of that person that tried to cancel

2656
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:37,900
you, and it's pretty much either like apologizing for stupid microaggressions or trying to cancel

2657
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:44,580
people or the stupid microaggressions, and I just want to say these are the people that

2658
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:54,020
you're trying to appease, and I want to tell you to stop because you can't, fuck'em.

2659
02:20:54,020 --> 02:21:00,340
I don't know which person you mean, if you mean that one, if you mean the one I'm thinking

2660
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:07,020
of with the pink display picture, I wasn't trying to appease that person, fuck that person.

2661
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:16,940
I don't apologize to that fucking white snowflake for anything.

2662
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:21,140
If you mean someone else though, I'm not sure.

2663
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:27,700
I, a bunch of them were shit, but I think some of them had a point, and that's what

2664
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:33,860
I did, and that's what I, and that's fucking, I'm not appeasing anyone, I'm being true to

2665
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:36,220
myself and my spirit.

2666
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:45,980
I don't think getting canceled is a good excuse to not take responsibility for the things

2667
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:50,980
you say, just because some people are really shitty about it.

2668
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:55,300
I don't know whether this guy meant that by saying fuck'em.

2669
02:21:55,300 --> 02:22:02,540
You could just be these specific people, but I don't know, I see that idea a lot, they're

2670
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:10,140
never gonna, like they is in like a large random assortment of people, very vague, just

2671
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:15,020
like, oh just don't worry about doing all this stuff that pisses them off, don't ever

2672
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:20,860
apologize no matter what, it's like, well sometimes you do say the wrong thing.

2673
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:26,220
The fact that some of them are shitty, I mean doesn't mean that those shitty people are

2674
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:32,940
wrong about everything.

2675
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:40,460
That one though, that one really pissed me off, it's the one I think you're talking about,

2676
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:41,460
but um.

2677
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:49,500
Yeah some people definitely are like way too into the cancel culture mode on Twitter, they

2678
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:53,220
just don't do anything else with their time on there.

2679
02:22:53,220 --> 02:23:00,260
Um, okay next, wait a minute, next, what the fuck is this?

2680
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:12,940
Next one is a link, ah, this is gonna give me a virus, this is a link to an mp3, okay

2681
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:19,380
I will just put this, I will put this in the chat for you guys, here we go, it's called

2682
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:26,500
UwuLilliaStrikesAgain, it is uploading, give it a second, okay here we go, why don't you

2683
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:32,140
just leave a fucking voicemail, oh my god, alright, uh, three, two, one, go.

2684
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:40,380
Oof, me, wait, um, listen, we need to talk.

2685
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:44,300
I'm not actually an anarcho-capitalist, just to be clear on that.

2686
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:51,060
No, no, uh, we're fine, it's just that I'm, you know, lately, cooking Michelle just hasn't

2687
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:58,820
really been doing it for me anymore, oh well, so um, I thought, you know, displace things

2688
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:01,700
up a little bit, I'd bring a friend.

2689
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,700
Yeah?

2690
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:23,420
Okay, alright, he's just totally cool with it.

2691
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:25,380
Which member of the league was that?

2692
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:32,140
Was it Mike the Microphone, or uh, Mike the Microphone's a Brody, oh, no, there's also

2693
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:38,140
those were all the voice clips from the ComeZone video, Welcome to the ComeZone.

2694
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:44,460
Oh, okay, yeah, okay, so I don't actually know who did that, I don't know if, I don't

2695
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:53,700
think it's OblivionFull themselves who said this, uh, man, just, uh, cooking Michelle

2696
02:24:53,700 --> 02:25:01,140
just isn't good enough anymore, okay, I see, go on.

2697
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:08,300
Okay, guys, Nate's back, he's back on the podcast.

2698
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,300
Wait a minute.

2699
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,260
Nate's back and he's getting fucked.

2700
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:15,540
You can't say, no Nate, no watch this week.

2701
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:18,020
There he is, there he is, uh, what's his name in the comments.

2702
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:22,340
Now we'll know if you say it, if you say it, you didn't watch the whole episode.

2703
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:29,660
Well, I respect that guy in the comments who every week comes back, I respect the dedication,

2704
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:35,820
I've got, I've turned around on him and I'm pro that guy, uh, where is the, uh,

2705
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:44,300
Same, honestly, it's, it's like, that he never like, like blossoms into anything bullshit

2706
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:47,980
like extra, it's just like the same thing every time, if this is the case, then I will

2707
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:49,380
say this.

2708
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:57,020
He's on message, he's on brand, he's consistent, he's not trying to link his like social media

2709
02:25:57,020 --> 02:26:01,980
underneath every post, you know, don't give him ideas though.

2710
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:06,380
He's just a pillar, he's just a pillar of the community.

2711
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:11,380
Next voicemail is called speediest voicemail, three, two, one, go.

2712
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:19,660
Uh, R-I-P-C-P, May max clutch, cars run like shit, I think I just got a speeding ticket

2713
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:20,660
early tonight.

2714
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:23,660
Ah, let's do this.

2715
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:36,780
No, oh god, oh dear, this is awful, I hate this, I'd like to think he's just sitting

2716
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:41,980
in his gamer chair playing like Forza Horizon right now, I'm scared, I'm scared there's

2717
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:50,460
going to be like a crashing sound, that's 100 miles per hour, 160 kilometers per hour,

2718
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:57,460
uh, when's the last time you're absolutely reckless, all right, I gotta get out, I gotta

2719
02:26:57,460 --> 02:27:14,140
get out of this cool side, yeah, there's one, I was reckless, I was reckless just yesterday,

2720
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:19,740
no it was Friday, I was reckless on Friday, I went out, I left my house, in the middle

2721
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:27,660
of a pandemic, I risked COVID-19 to hang out with people in the Boston Common, uh, in

2722
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:35,620
the fresh air, the poisoned air, uh, I hope I don't get any viruses, uh, oh yeah, you

2723
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:42,820
were with Munchin Kazian stuff, and Azcan, yes, yes, uh, it was nice though, it was nice

2724
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:46,860
though because Azcan picked me up, I thought I was going to have to, I wasn't going to

2725
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:50,860
risk the tea, I wasn't going to risk that, but I thought I was going to have to get an

2726
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:56,020
Uber, which is like, I mean that's not that risky, it was a little, it seemed a little

2727
02:27:56,020 --> 02:28:01,300
eh, but I didn't have to, Azcan picked me up, uh, I don't know, I didn't go near anyone,

2728
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:07,140
we just went to the Boston Common, hung out, and then came back to my house, and I was

2729
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:14,620
fucked around my backyard, like we usually do, uh, so that was me, that was uh, if I

2730
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:20,860
die, that's why, that's what did it, it's Munchie's fault, lol, what about you guys,

2731
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:27,500
have you been reckless lately, have you drove a hundredth of any school zones, nah, I don't

2732
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:36,020
be reckless that often, yeah my life is boring and uninteresting, if you're not, if you're

2733
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:41,300
not at least, if you're not at least a little likely to get COVID-19, then what are you even

2734
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:48,300
doing, what are you, then what are you thinking, I mean I went outside a little bit, ah there

2735
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:53,980
we go, but it wasn't like that reckless, I went on like the train and I just had my

2736
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:58,700
mask on and I kept it to myself and it was fine, I went to play D&D yesterday with five

2737
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:04,300
other people in a tiny space and none of us were masked up, I guess that's almost reckless,

2738
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:14,380
I really don't want to go on the T until I'm vaccinated, like that seems like, that seems

2739
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:18,540
like a super bad place to go if you want to like avoid, like going out in the common like

2740
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:23,980
it's like, it's outside, outside's not that dangerous, the T seems like the exact place

2741
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:28,420
that like tons and tons of people are constantly shuffling around, breathing on shit, I know

2742
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:33,900
people don't consistently wear their masks, because I did wear, I did ride the T one time,

2743
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:41,620
it was when I went to that George Floyd March thing, I rode the T that day and the fucking

2744
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:45,300
guys on there weren't wearing their masks and I was like, I don't know about this, so

2745
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:52,660
I don't want to avoid that until I got this shit in my arm, but I'll fucking go out to

2746
02:29:52,660 --> 02:30:00,740
a park, I mean that's fine, that's fine, I am like not a very much of a risk taker, I

2747
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:05,940
get cautious feelings when I was like, oh no, I could be doing something bad, what if

2748
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:10,260
I get hurt and I'm far away from people, I should go, I should head back, you know that

2749
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:18,500
sort of feeling, I feel a little guilty that I'm not epic, but at the same time I'm alive,

2750
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:22,820
so I don't know, I don't know how to feel about it sometimes.

2751
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:30,300
Being dead is the least epic state of being, but I don't really seek thrills.

2752
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:33,500
I guess there's like a pressure to like, oh if you don't seek thrills you're not, you

2753
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:41,940
know, cool or whatever, I'm like, well I guess I don't and maybe that's bad.

2754
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:48,300
Cautious feelings should be the title of your debut album, I'd never release it, it'll be

2755
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:59,300
too reckless of me, yeah, yeah, too embarrassing, next voicemail is called Advice, 3, 2, 1, go.

2756
02:31:00,300 --> 02:31:01,300
Kill yourself.

2757
02:31:01,300 --> 02:31:09,580
No, that's the most reckless thing of all, that's the feckless thing to do, what if you

2758
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:13,180
fucked up and you're just paralyzed for life, that's what I think about when I think about

2759
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:19,300
killing myself, just make sure you do the job properly, that's not, that's not worse

2760
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:27,340
than being dead, that's not worse, I would say it is, I mean they both, they're both

2761
02:31:27,380 --> 02:31:33,020
unfortunate states, I think being dead is about the worst state.

2762
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:35,620
If I was paralyzed I would ask for mercy killing.

2763
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:36,620
I probably wouldn't.

2764
02:31:36,620 --> 02:31:37,620
I would, absolutely.

2765
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:40,180
You should ask for robot legs.

2766
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:44,420
I mean I'm already like partially crippled and I already think about suicide, like man

2767
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:48,420
this sucks, I don't like this, I don't like being able to, not be able to run anymore,

2768
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:55,820
the zombie apocalypse happens, I'm so fucked, I mean that's an outside possibility, that's

2769
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:59,820
an outside chance, you're worried about, this is nonsense.

2770
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:03,820
COVID was step one dude, it's happening.

2771
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:09,820
You, hey, fuck you for telling me your feelings, they're not valid.

2772
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:11,820
No, that's fair.

2773
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:17,820
Yeah, you're white, get fucked.

2774
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:22,820
Next one is called Let's Be Frank Ferda, three, two, one, go.

2775
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:33,820
I am in the center of the Shepi, Bingzirk and PC or Turkey, go.

2776
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:42,820
To explain, a long time ago you and me had this row where we talked about creativity

2777
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:51,820
and ideas, specifically, we had no plans or like any idea of how they would actually

2778
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:58,820
work, the existence of the idea was funny enough, for me, that was why YouTube series

2779
02:32:58,820 --> 02:33:05,820
was all about war, I was going to combine more and more of a footage of Sonic, I said

2780
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:11,820
yeah, yeah, didn't know how to do it and really didn't have any plans to do it, you obviously

2781
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:15,820
didn't hear it, my mic was terrible and my mobile phone quite a bit.

2782
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:17,820
I hate you.

2783
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:19,820
Why did you double it up?

2784
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:21,820
I could barely understand that.

2785
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:24,820
I feel like that was an accident, it had to be an accident, right?

2786
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:29,820
I also think it was an accident, I thought it was on purpose at first, but I decided

2787
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:30,820
it was an accident.

2788
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:33,820
There was nothing funny about it, it was a legit question, there's no reason to echo

2789
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:34,820
that.

2790
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:38,820
There was nothing funny about the echo and also why did it cut off there?

2791
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:42,820
I don't understand, it seemed like the voicemail ended before the question was done.

2792
02:33:42,820 --> 02:33:46,820
Didn't we have a voicemail about this project before?

2793
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:53,820
This sounds familiar, sad AM over something that's ringing a bell in the deep recesses

2794
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:58,820
of my brain that still unfortunately can't let go of voicemails.

2795
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:03,820
It sounds like he did make a voicemail about it before, but he said his mic was bad, so

2796
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:04,820
maybe we did hear it.

2797
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:08,820
Was that the joke that the mic was purposely bad this time?

2798
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:10,820
I don't know.

2799
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:15,820
I genuinely didn't understand anything that he said.

2800
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:21,820
If you think a thing would be funny, you should make it and post it on YouTube and maybe it'll

2801
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:23,820
go viral, that's my...

2802
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:28,820
And I'm sorry about your microphone, please don't do this to me again.

2803
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:33,820
Okay, next voicemail, I don't even want to listen to it, but I guess I have to, it's

2804
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:39,820
called It's Okay Ben, I know that you're not racist, lol, 3, 2, 1, go.

2805
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:40,820
Konnichiwa.

2806
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:43,820
This was Summoner-san.

2807
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:45,820
Benno Sento-san.

2808
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:50,820
You have been cancelled for racism.

2809
02:34:50,820 --> 02:34:52,820
Noto Teru.

2810
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:54,820
Benno Sento-san.

2811
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:56,820
Noto Resisto.

2812
02:34:56,820 --> 02:34:58,820
He treated you.

2813
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:00,820
He communist.

2814
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:03,820
He corrected of a baby for skin.

2815
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:06,820
But noto Resisto.

2816
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:07,820
Thank you.

2817
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:09,820
Benno Sento-san.

2818
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:21,820
He know that despite being only 13% of the population, Usapu make up 50% of the

2819
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:24,820
imperial down population.

2820
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:27,820
Really make you think.

2821
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:30,820
Okay, until you next time.

2822
02:35:30,820 --> 02:35:33,820
Sayonara.

2823
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:40,820
This reminds me of somebody who was talking about it and someone else posted it in my

2824
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:41,820
discord.

2825
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:50,820
A video that was played at CPAC of a Japanese guy calling Donald Trump the last American

2826
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:56,820
samurai and saying how honorable he was and how he wants to... wait, Gabe, have you seen

2827
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:57,820
this?

2828
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,820
Yeah, I was talking about it last time.

2829
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:02,820
Were you... oh, that's where I heard it, I'm so stupid, lol.

2830
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:09,820
I actually, someone posted it in my discord and I watched it and I just thought, American

2831
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:13,820
samurai, whoever heard of such an outlandish thing.

2832
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:18,820
You say, as you stroke the Kawasaki scrolls.

2833
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:30,820
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm Teru Teru, so noto samurai anymore.

2834
02:36:30,820 --> 02:36:34,820
Cancel it again, can't use that accent.

2835
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:39,820
No, it's funny, it's funny.

2836
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:45,820
That voice is based on offensive stereotypes because it's how Japanese actually sounds in

2837
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:47,820
real life.

2838
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:52,820
Next voicemail is called Jebediah Prickinson is still alive, unfortunately.

2839
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:56,820
Three, two, one, go.

2840
02:36:56,820 --> 02:37:01,820
Hello, this is me, Jebediah Prickinson.

2841
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:04,820
I'm here to say done.

2842
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:08,820
Can't kill myself anymore.

2843
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:20,820
Though, I guess, did Jenae slash Trixie's live an asshole bitch now?

2844
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:28,820
Okay, release the groaning lecture you weasel know.

2845
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:30,820
Oh dear.

2846
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:32,820
Alright.

2847
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:34,820
Okay, thanks, Jebediah.

2848
02:37:34,820 --> 02:37:41,820
Sorry you can't kill yourself anymore, but thanks for the voicemail.

2849
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:46,820
Next one is called No More Lies, a league of n-fuckers.

2850
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:51,820
Oh wait, I think this is- it's asterisk asterisk n, so I don't know-

2851
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:53,820
It sounded a little bad.

2852
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:56,820
No, three, two, one, go.

2853
02:37:56,820 --> 02:38:06,820
I will really, really, really, really react to it.

2854
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:07,820
Okay.

2855
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:08,820
Shit.

2856
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:11,820
Shit, I didn't mean to give consent, but I did.

2857
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:14,820
Oh, damn.

2858
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:20,780
We all know that once consent is given it can never be withdrawn. It's open season on my asshole

2859
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:29,880
The gates of hell have been thrown wide open if you know what I mean

2860
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:43,900
Next voicemail is called the real question pulling back the curtain unveiling the three two one go

2861
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:54,240
Hey guys, I just wanted to know what is the ratio between normal porn and hentai? Do you guys usually

2862
02:38:55,740 --> 02:39:01,860
Consume on a weekly basis. They're asking for myself. Goodbye

2863
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:05,420
Hmm

2864
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:08,100
Normal porn to hentai ratio

2865
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:10,220
I

2866
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:18,660
Mean I don't think I yeah, like define nor did they just mean like live-action? I would assume. I think I think he means live-action

2867
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:21,060
Okay

2868
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:24,180
Yeah, it's it's more hentai than it is and I suppose

2869
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:28,820
Yeah, I mean

2870
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:35,180
Zero like zero to one. I think it's probably more hentai because I just like I like a

2871
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:44,300
Manga the I like the comic form for it and I I go for that a lot of the time more so than than for

2872
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:46,820
videos, so

2873
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:48,980
Man's probably my ratio is probably like

2874
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:51,180
three to one

2875
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:53,180
for for hentai lol

2876
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:57,340
Tom I'm trying to think this is a very important question

2877
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:02,620
Yeah, it's probably probably similar to your answer. I think I think it's probably

2878
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:07,940
Wow, maybe like we're all we're all in the same two to one three to one something like that

2879
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:13,060
I mean, we're all art people so like you can appreciate the artistry at the same time, you know

2880
02:40:13,060 --> 02:40:14,060
It's like it's like a dual

2881
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:21,140
That's not what I go to fucking that's not what I fucking jerk it to know like oh line with the line weights are so dynamic

2882
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:26,700
I don't know once you're once you're done. You can reflect on it be like, you know, that was some pretty good line

2883
02:40:26,700 --> 02:40:28,220
I mean, I

2884
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:32,300
Mean there is definitely there are definitely art styles that are like

2885
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:37,380
Bad to the point that I'm like I this is this is impacting my enjoyment

2886
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:44,700
for sure and there are some artists who I think are good and I think is sexier

2887
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:49,020
But whatever I don't think about that

2888
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:51,580
but on

2889
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:59,780
This looks like it's the last voicemail. It's called is my going to finally to you turn on on the brony lecture three two one go

2890
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:07,180
To those waiting with baited breath for that favorite media catchphrase the u-turn I

2891
02:41:07,740 --> 02:41:09,740
Have only one thing to say

2892
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,500
You turn if you want to

2893
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:17,460
The ladies not for turning

2894
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:21,420
Margaret Thatcher

2895
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:28,100
What the fuck is she talking? I don't understand what any of that means. It's I don't know too much about that speech

2896
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:31,660
But she was a asshole. She was a

2897
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:34,980
Conservative fuck over the poor sort of lady

2898
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:39,140
Yeah, yeah, her and Reagan best buddies

2899
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:42,500
The yeah, I don't get it

2900
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:45,220
Okay, then there's a dumb

2901
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:54,140
Here's the context. This is a Wikipedia article on this the ladies not for turning was a phrase used by Margaret Thatcher in her speech to the

2902
02:41:54,140 --> 02:42:00,580
Conservative Party conference in 1980 the term has been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety

2903
02:42:00,780 --> 02:42:08,220
The phrase made reference to Thatcher's refusal to perform a u-turn in response to opposition to her liberalization of the economy

2904
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:11,140
Which some commenters as well as her predecessors

2905
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:17,300
Conservatively that Ted Heath had urged because unemployment had risen to two million by the autumn of 1980. Oh

2906
02:42:19,980 --> 02:42:21,660
Okay, so

2907
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:26,500
All right, all she's saying is my critics say that I should stop

2908
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:28,980
privatizing industry

2909
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:35,940
Just because it's destroying the economy and making everyone unemployed and to that I say the lady is not for turning

2910
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:41,420
We're going forward. No u-turns here. So to that I say no

2911
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:43,420
based as fuck

2912
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:44,420
No

2913
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:46,420
Yeah, exactly

2914
02:42:47,380 --> 02:42:51,740
Some people say I should do something and I say I will not

2915
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:56,820
God what a powerful speech

2916
02:42:57,540 --> 02:43:04,380
The Margaret Thatcher really had girl power is all I'm saying. She was a girl boss of her age of her time

2917
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:10,060
Absolutely the girl boss if you if you will the first woman ever

2918
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:13,780
The first woman ever to ruin Great Britain

2919
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:19,420
Yeah

2920
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:23,440
Oh, we just got another one we just got another voicemail. I would you know I've

2921
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:27,980
Sorry, but it's called. Let's be frank further

2922
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:31,620
three two one go I

2923
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:36,860
Sent in being Zerk as a way to lament my cringe voicemail

2924
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:44,340
I happen to have seen all of dirt gently sees one and the gut steam from the Zerk 97 sound fitting at the time

2925
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:50,260
Apologies to Gringis Vegas. I was panicked and short on time because I procrastinated

2926
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:53,700
I wanted the drama the name seppy by the way

2927
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:59,060
I put my name in the voicemail because I thought there was a separate space for the title

2928
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:02,700
My shower speed run personal best is

2929
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:05,780
417.71

2930
02:44:06,060 --> 02:44:09,980
To be fair, I have a hard to damn cool afro

2931
02:44:10,100 --> 02:44:15,340
So I prefer to be in a different division if like a ball what what

2932
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:18,060
You go cut off

2933
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:20,060
What was the division cold?

2934
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:22,580
Thanks for the voicemail

2935
02:44:24,140 --> 02:44:27,860
Different afro afro division like afro percent

2936
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:30,900
Yeah, because I am at I

2937
02:44:31,340 --> 02:44:35,420
Am it probably does make it harder to shampoo if you have an afro. I believe it

2938
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:36,980
Um

2939
02:44:36,980 --> 02:44:43,060
Well shit, I guess that's I guess that's the end of the voicemails. We we made it

2940
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:46,460
Just closing

2941
02:44:46,820 --> 02:44:50,620
Any closing thoughts before we wrap this sucker up?

2942
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:56,700
I don't like it when the PCP is too long and I get tired

2943
02:44:57,660 --> 02:45:04,820
Yeah, it's it's not it's not that long. We're under three hours. It's not it's just the voicemail

2944
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:08,260
When the voicemail is dragged because I was only here for two hours and I already feel wiped

2945
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:12,700
That's true. I feel white all the time. Oh, no

2946
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:17,940
Bad that's that's bad

2947
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:23,500
Okay

2948
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:25,500
Go to speak pop comm

2949
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:30,940
Slash PCP voicemail if you want to leave us a voicemail, but not too many

2950
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:33,780
Cuz there's too many of them

2951
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:37,220
Leave a voicemail if you're stupid

2952
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:40,380
Definitely don't do that

2953
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:42,380
and go to

2954
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:51,060
patreon.com slash the procrastinators to pledge five adoradoo for bonus episodes, which will include

2955
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:58,940
That other one you can hear me beat these guys at poker and also soon you will see me beat at

2956
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:06,300

Nope
