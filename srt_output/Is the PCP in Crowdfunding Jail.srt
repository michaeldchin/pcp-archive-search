00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Question for our audience. Is the PCP in crowdfunding jail? I'm joined with Best Guy Ever.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To discuss whether or not the PCP is in crowdfunding jail. I'm very curious as to what our audience is going to have to say about this, but we're basically going to be presenting a case based on an argument you and I were having all morning.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes we were, yes we were. And I really, yeah, honestly what it comes down to is what the people out there think. So we could argue all day, but this is a much better idea to put it out there and let the people judge.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So for starters, what is your concern about the idea that we might be in crowdfunding jail?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, now not to shit on anybody in particular, but so here's the basic concern that some of us have here. And it's that so since the Pleeve and the Weeb was, you know, it was a Digi and Jesse project, of course, obviously, from the start.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But as time went along, the rest of us got involved with it to the degree of, we were basically, we were part of the Kickstarter, you know, there were reward tiers added to get us flown out.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And we each, you know, took the amount of money proportional to what it cost for us to attend. We didn't make any money on top of that and produced content regardless, but we were there and we were involved.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And most of us were on episodes of the Pleeve and the Weeb and maybe people don't even know that, I'm not really sure, but we were involved on that front and eventually when the episodes come out, the people will see that we were involved.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And the concern that we have is that so considering the fact that it's no secret that the Pleeve and the Weeb is taken quite a while to be released and it's, you know, it's been nine months.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Beyond what was anticipated by people.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like, it would be fine if it just took a long time to come out if that was what had been established from the beginning.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But the sort of projected schedule was that it would take some six months or so to release the first season.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And it's taken some nine months or so to release one episode.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And from what we hear, the next one's around the corner, not too far, but you know, we're not really sure.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're not really sure.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so the concern that I and my PCB brothers have is we've been thinking about future possible Kickstarter projects.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know, we've got a couple of things kicking around.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Redcon 3.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Redcon 3.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You know, we've got a couple of ideas for things we want to do for that and other stuff.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And, you know, we were just mulling around the idea and then we thought, like, OK, what if we made a Kickstarter and then, you know, it occurred to us that, oh, you know, now that we think about it, the last sort of PCP related Kickstarter has not really delivered what, you know, it's not done.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You know, it hasn't been finished yet.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And so based on that, we were like, is it really, do people really want to hear that the PCP boys are doing another Kickstarter type thing or an Indiegogo or whatever the fuck before that's done?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And so you and I had a disagreement and there's a couple of factors at play as to, you know, if that's true, where the responsibility is, what, you know, different individuals, members owe to the audience and what we can expect people to say.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So what do you think?

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you think?

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, I think the way to explore this is, first of all, is the plebe and the weeb Kickstarter a failed Kickstarter?

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OK.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If so, to what extent and how to to what extent is that true for the PCP and how much responsibility does the PCP even have?

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The interesting thing is that if you look at it from the lens of the PCP's involvement in the plebe and the weeb, I actually think it comes out like startlingly great because the plebe and the weeb was a Kickstarter.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Like the idea of the Kickstarter was 10 episodes season one, 10 episodes season two of this show.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That is, me and Jesse do a talk show about anime and it's a jokey funny thing. Jesse edits it and posts it and like the real humor of it is basically Jesse's editing.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Like the actual content of the show is just like a pretty shitty review of a show made funny in post editing.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we wanted to have a Radcon 2.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Radcon 1 was just where all of us flew out to my house and we made a bunch of shit and just so happened that plebe and the weeb was one of the things we made because it was an idea we'd had for years.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
With Radcon 2, it was sort of funded by the plebe and the weeb, but we did not just use it for that.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We ended up using Radcon 2 to produce assloads of content.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Very true.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That was completely not even related to the Kickstarter, but made possible by the Kickstarter.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I think from the perspective of what did PCP fans get out of the plebe and the weeb?

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They got a lot without even anticipating it.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's true.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They got shitload, like hours and hours and hours of let's plays, a lot of which haven't even come out yet.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Several big lecture videos that have been some of the most popular content we've ever made.

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If not for the plebe and the weeb Kickstarter, you don't get the Munchy lecture on Parkour due 91.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't get the Kingdom Hearts lecture.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You don't get Ben's Sadachu lecture, of course.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That was from the first Radcon.

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, was it? Oh, fuck.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, never mind.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But from Radcon 2, yours and Munchy's lectures, we get the Ape Escape playthrough five hours long.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You get the Hanboy Winter War, the PCP wrestling, and then just all the weird shit like Jesse is Digi and hippos, Jesse and all that shit.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stuff people love.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So you also have all of the background content from the Kickstarter.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you were a backer of it, you got all the videos of us watching the shows, all the videos.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, I realize at this point, I'm starting to sound like I'm defending the lack of the Kickstarter, the actual product.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No, it's still a bad thing.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a very bad thing that the product is not out.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
However, I'm thinking of this in terms of what it means for the PCP because the plebe and the weeb is a me and Jesse project.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So are me and Jesse in Kickstarter jail?

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Definitely.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
All right.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There you have it, folks.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Is Jesse super in Kickstarter jail?

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Absolutely.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, don't throw Jesse under the bus.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, okay.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know it's his responsibility.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's his editing project.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's true.

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, it's my fault, though.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Everything about the plebe and the weeb Kickstarter is my fault because I started it and I managed it.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
True.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Though I would argue that everyone is complicit who shared in its warm glow.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There's a lot of reasons that the show hasn't come out yet.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I would say that the biggest reason, sort of at the core of it all, is that I don't think Jesse even knew what I meant.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I said, let's kickstart it.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And he said, that sounds like a good idea.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then I immediately launched a Kickstarter, which he thought I meant, let's do it eventually someday.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But I was like, I want to get moving on this because we all wanted Radcon 2 to happen sooner than Radcon 1.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Damn right.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So it was basically an excuse to fund Radcon 2 as fast as possible without really considering the amount of work that it was going to be to do the plebe in the weeb season 2.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The fact that all of it was going to end up on him to edit and then like a bunch of disasters happen in his life immediately afterwards.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So it was like a really badly timed thing.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And so it's really my fault for putting it on him in the first place.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It also, in spite of having been a successful Kickstarter, there's not that much money in it.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Most of the money went to the production.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Everybody else, all the PCP members were just flown out.

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's all you guys got out of it.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the rest of the money, anything that wasn't used for the project.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm still holding on to the money that's supposed to be used to ship all these fucking Blu-rays out.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But other than that, all the money was for Jesse for editing.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I gave it all to him so that he could, because he's fucking his life is in dire straits and he needs the help.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I was like, here, have all this money to help with his moving shit.

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So there's ultimately not much money in it for anybody else.

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And the way I see it is I produced this project.

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I came in and I essentially hired a director, which is Jesse.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Director slash editor.

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I hired a bunch of actors, which is the rest of the PCP.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the responsibility of the project being finished is on me for having orchestrated that.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm the one who picked everybody involved.

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm the one who set up a situation that was not ideal for getting this finished in a timely fashion.

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, the Cleveland the Weeb Kickstarter is not canceled, by the way.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If I'm making it sound that way, we're still working on the Cleveland the Weeb.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Jesse just seems to be working on it at like he he's given up on it coming out in a timely fashion.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He's editing it at his pace, which leaves the question of how does this affect the rest of the PCP?

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Does anybody else not get to do a Kickstarter?

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Or even as a group like funding a Radcon 3 when the Kickstarter for the last one was pretty clearly a Radcon 2 Kickstarter?

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Does this look does this bode poorly for the rest of the PCP?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's the question.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I would argue it does.

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I would argue that it does.

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I think it's because we have a different idea and we're just exploring the issue, right?

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like it would be in my best interest to deny this and to go against it.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But we're explorers of intellectual content.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So here we are, folks.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
To me, it seems like when I think about myself, okay, I would never give money to anyone under any circumstances.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But if I was forced to, I was part of a Kickstarter.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, so you raised a couple issues there.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
One of the things is that despite the fact that the Kickstarter, you know, the actual product at the core of it all, at the center of the Kickstarter was not delivered,

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
there's all this other content that came as a result of it.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I couldn't agree more and that's all great and wonderful.

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But it is not the thing that was delivered or the thing that was promised.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it harkens me back to my favorite YouTuber, Anita Sarkeesian, and all the grief that she got for, you know,

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
back from her original Kickstarter or whatever it was, she developed a presence and made tons of content.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But a lot of people shout on her because they hate women, but also because she was not delivering specifically the product that was promised.

134
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And she distinctly got a lot of flack for it.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You know, whether her true fans were the ones doing that or not, the fact remains that bad press was generated for her

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
based on that situation.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I can't help but feel that it's a similar sort of situation in a case like this.

138
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so the thing that could vindicate us, I think, the PCP as a group, is indeed the fact.

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And one of the missions that I feel you are here to do is to separate you and Jesse as the culpable parties responsible for getting it done.

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And the rest of us, I mean, we have offered many times to help.

141
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And it's not that we're not wanted, but that's not what the show is, so we can't.

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We cannot help.

143
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, that's the thing.

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's the way I see it is that the purpose of The Pleeve and the Weeb is that it's me and Jesse's show.

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a show that I organize and that he edits and sort of makes watchable.

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Right.

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And the only reason everybody else was involved was because we wanted Radcon 2.

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We wanted everybody to be there.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And so the only way that made set like the way I saw it was like, all right, we're raising all this money for the Kickstarter.

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We want this Kickstarter to fund everybody to come to one place.

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So the only way to justifiably fly them is to say, well, they'll be in an episode.

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So everybody who's there is going to be in an episode because that justifies flying them down here for this event.

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Whose main purpose is to generate as much content as possible, not just to generate The Pleeve and the Weeb,

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
but to create all kinds of shit that we can only do in person because, you know, it's just, it's content that can't exist over the Internet.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Without a doubt.

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or would not be as good, you know.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So the way I see it is like the core product is the me and Jesse show.

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everyone else is just kind of incidentally involved as part of something else.

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
As part of, and I think a lot of the people who backed the Kickstarter just wanted Radcon 2.

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I saw that expressed by a lot of people at the time.

161
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I agree.

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I know a lot of people who are satisfied with the stuff that's come out or just don't care because we all put out tons of shit anyways.

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And it's not like The Pleeve and the Weeb is radically better than all the other stuff we put out.

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, yeah.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like the specific product, yes, it is missing and that's a shame, but it's not like we've all gone quiet.

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not like Spoonie who promised he was going to make a movie and then has literally done nothing.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like, I think Spoonie would be in better condition if he had promised a movie but was still doing his regular content.

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He'd still have a lot of patrons.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I agree.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But, you know, we're in a situation where post-Pleeve and the Weeb, you know, recording is all of us entering our most prolific phases ever.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You've done me a Mephava, we Agua, I've been the human content machine.

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Of course.

173
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The only person who's really slowed down has been Jesse because he's not in a good position to make videos right now.

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know, he's just, and like, to me, that's kind of like an act of God preventing this Kickstarter from being completed.

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Like, I don't think it's just Jesse.

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like, it's just the circumstances surrounding him.

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like, you can say, like on some level, sure, it's like he could have done more by now, but like, it's not really just as simple as he hasn't done it.

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's also like things are, you know, things are not in a place where he can do it easily.

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let me throw this at you.

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So we can, I feel like it's appropriate to, we can remove Jesse from the situation and we can just look at the fact that, you know, nine months, one video.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You know, and maybe a second one soon, who knows.

182
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But based on just those facts on the ground alone, considering that this is a Kickstarter with, you know, promised rewards and it's a fairly official thing, even though you don't have to do your Kickstarter stuff, you can't just blow it off, I think.

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There's no legal repercussions.

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But we're not, it's not about legal, it's about goodwill.

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But like, considering that you're in that situation, it reminds me of basically what happened to Hussey when he was trying to make HiveSwap.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And he basically had a situation where, not to compare the two, but like, he had like a scummy developer just basically steal his money and, you know, run off.

187
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
As I understand it, I don't know, I don't know the odd gentleman or whatever the names are that well, but that's how I understood it to be.

188
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Or in some way, the money was lost due to that bullshit.

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And I absolutely put the blame there on Hussey specifically, or if not him, whoever was in charge of the project, if it wasn't like specifically him, but I feel like he's the guy.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because of his managerial accountability, and it's his responsibility to deliver.

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's why you shouldn't put this on the PCV, you should put it on me.

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm the manager.

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I organized everything. I bought everybody's playing tickets, you know, or gave them the money to buy the playing tickets.

194
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I fucking did all this. I did everything for this. At a loss, I might add.

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I didn't make any money off the plea of the week Kickstarter, and in fact, I lost a lot of money off of it.

196
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sure.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
From driving everybody around and fucking buying food for people and just everything I did involved.

198
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've only lost money from it, but I'm okay with that because I wanted the product.

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Also, Radcon 2 was like the worst week of my entire life because it was just a stressful nightmare.

200
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I look back on it so fondly, but I wasn't in your position.

201
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
No, I mean, I'm happy with all the products that came out of it. It was just a really trying time.

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Having 10 insane people in my house and I'm trying to organize a show with a guy who doesn't want to be working on the show at all.

203
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's really the, that's the issue right there, isn't it?

204
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry, Jesse. I love you. You're my brother. I don't want to show you at all.

205
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I want to help. Let me help. Let me help make the show happen. What can I do? Tell me what I could do.

206
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I, okay.

207
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I just don't think it, I mean, we've talked about having you edit a certain episode before,

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
like even when we first recorded it, we just haven't gotten to that episode yet.

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right, that's way down the pipe anyway.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The thing is that Jesse has extensively planned this, like he has a whole narrative for the plebeian, the weeb season.

211
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think that's why he doesn't want to give it up.

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's because like, he has like a clear vision of what the narrative across it's going to be.

213
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And we've even started, like we started recording season three, or season two, however you want to look at it,

214
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
with the idea that it takes place after that narrative.

215
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So it kind of has to happen a certain way, you know, which is why we're not just, why I haven't just wrestled,

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
all the files, if I wanted to just give them to somebody else, I could.

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But like, I want Jesse's product.

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So do I.

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So do I.

220
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I see it as, it doesn't entirely matter how long it takes to come out.

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Like, it's a shame if it takes a really long time, but like, it will come out.

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I'd rather it come out than have to change it just to rush it out the door.

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I think a lot of the people who would back it would agree, like they backed this because they wanted the show that Jesse edits.

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They don't just want the plebe and the weeb just in name only.

225
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's how we get Mighty No. 9, you know?

226
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like, yeah, Mighty No. 9 came out, but it looks nothing like the fucking game that was promised, and that's why everybody's mad about it.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Nobody's happy that it's just out, you know?

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So if the plebe and the weeb came out and it's not the show Jesse wanted to make, people are going to be like,

229
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
well, why the fuck did I back it if you're not going to give me the show I want?

230
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, okay, but to play Devil's Advocate, you know, Hiveswap, for example, went through multiple changes, you know,

231
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the whole big fuck up.

232
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And the product that's delivered now is nothing like the original, and yet people like Hippo are pretty happy with it.

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They seem to like the product, though he wasn't a backer or anything.

234
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And to a certain extent, like my opinion isn't really like the right one to be like voicing on this issue.

235
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Like I'm coming in from a certain angle of like involvement with the project as opposed to...

236
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But I'm trying to like speak for the backers because that's where my concern lies.

237
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I want to, you know, my interest is making sure that people feel satisfied with like any obligations that I personally owe them.

238
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And I want to make good on that.

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's the thing.

240
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What I want, if there is to be a Kickstarter or something for Radcon 3, me and Jesse's name should not be on it,

241
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and we should not have any managerial duties on it.

242
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It should be best guy ever's Kickstarter where he runs the show.

243
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because I think you through, even if it's just guilt, will get it done.

244
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have no doubt I will get it done.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I have no doubt.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You will get whatever it is done.

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The Plebe and the Weeb as a specific show is a me and Jesse show.

248
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And it's just a show that like the nature of it has led to this situation.

249
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If it was your show, it would be done by now because that's the way you work.

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's true.

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I remember when it was a twinkle in y'all's eye.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I remember those days so well.

253
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It was a dream.

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It was a dream to do Plebe and the Weeb.

255
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And it just was done at the wrong time.

257
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It was just badly planned in terms of timing and then stomped on by an act of God immediately afterwards

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
where Jesse's house flooded and everything he owned was destroyed.

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
True.

260
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like literally while we were filming it.

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So there's a lot of reasons that hasn't come out.

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But that's me and Jesse's project.

263
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Best guy ever's project?

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean look at all the stuff that came out of Radcon 2 that did come out.

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Everyone else's projects are out.

266
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hippo made like 30 videos.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You made one of your biggest videos, Kingdom Hearts Lecture.

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's a real winner.

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Which you edited to a video that if I had made it would have just been posted exactly as is

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
without the enormous list of time codes in the description.

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So many fucking time codes.

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because I wouldn't have watched it back to do that.

274
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Right?

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't blame you.

277
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I spent a lot of time meticulously color correcting.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So yeah.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I give a shit everybody.

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There you go.

281
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So I'm just saying that the way I see it, if we tried to say kickstart the next plebe

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in the weave or the next Digi and Jesse show, then yes, it would be a bad idea and everybody

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
would shit on us for it.

284
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But if we kickstart the best guy ever show by the guy who knows what he's doing and will

285
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
make sure it happens.

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Right.

287
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And it might be more necessary to do crowdfunding for Radcon 3 because we don't even really

288
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
have a venue.

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's what comes to mind that situation.

291
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah.

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There's no place, none of us have a big enough house at this point that can host it.

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So maybe we'll have to rent a space for Radcon 3.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know what it'll have to be or we'll have to go somewhere specific.

295
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So yeah, that's kind of why it's a question.

296
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like it might have to be crowdfunded if there's a Radcon 3.

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But like, you know, I'm sure we can come up with a project to tie into it that is not,

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
maybe the project is just Radcon 3.

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's what I was thinking.

300
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Which everyone knows can produce content.

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
All we have to do is link them the playlist of Radcon 2 content that I put as the card

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
in every single PCP episode that comes out so that people see the real shit that we

303
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
do for the sake of future Radcons.

304
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Because I know it's going to happen.

305
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And yeah, I wish that we had somehow included a little bit more.

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's all about framing and marketing really.

307
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If I just felt personally that the content that was produced from this Kickstarter was

308
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a little bit more entwined with just all that shit.

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And it kind of was.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The $5,000 Kickstarter limit where Best Guy Ever and Hippocrite are coming to Radcon 2

311
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
says, if we're going to make this much money, we might as well bring the other guys down

312
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
too, yeah.

313
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This amount will pay for Hippocrite and Best Guy Ever to fly down once more.

314
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And even to guest in at least one episode of The Pleeve in the weeb season one, this

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
will also propagate more wacky Rad content from everyone involved.

316
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That should be the main focus with maybe some like, some core project that just like we

317
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
gather around and then make shit other than that.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's what I want.

319
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The thing about The Pleeve in the weeb is that like the reason I went so hard on like

320
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
making it this big extravagant project is I thought it would be necessary to do that

321
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
to fund it.

322
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like I thought nobody will pay for The Pleeve in the weeb unless it sounds like really huge

323
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and crazy and expensive.

324
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
When the reality is we hit the initial goal like immediately.

325
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You only ask for a 1200 fucking bucks.

326
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's like nothing.

327
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, because it wasn't originally going to have everybody involved.

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It was going to be just me and Jesse.

329
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But we said, well, if we add in people with stretch goals, maybe we'll make a lot more

330
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and be able to fly everybody down.

331
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Again, it's originally me and Jesse project.

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Nobody else was even involved at the start.

333
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's right.

334
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They're all just actors I hired on.

335
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So the way I see it, if we just are funding Radcon 3, maybe people see it differently.

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But that's why we're doing this on, that's why we're airing this out on the channel.

337
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because we had this entire discussion this morning at great length in which I concluded

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think we could definitely do it.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think that as long as everybody understands that it's not going to be in my managerial hands

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
or Jesse's editing hands.

341
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's going to be projects that everybody wants to do, that everybody knows how to do

342
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and is going to be on time because the people running it will make sure that's the case.

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Indeed, we will.

344
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And I think if people understand that they might be reticent to it.

345
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't even think that many people see the plebe in the weed Kickstarter as a failure,

346
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
which again, it's not canceled.

347
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It is still in the works.

348
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But the question is like if we do another one before it's over, does that look bad for the PCP?

349
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And again, I won't even be involved.

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If the PCP, if a requirement for this Kickstarter is it can't fund Digi's trip,

351
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'll pay for my own trip to Redcon 3.

352
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm willing to throw myself completely under the bus for the rest of the PCP to be able to do this

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
because I really don't think it should be any of your responsibility what happened with,

354
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
or what is happening with the plebe in the weed.

355
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Which incidentally, a lot of current PCP fans probably weren't even around for.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Channels twice as big as it was when we did it.

357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And a lot of those people are probably just fucking confused what we're talking about.

358
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm sure that's true.

359
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know, I just...

360
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't want anything...

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay, the reason why I...

362
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Here's a little psychology of myself.

363
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The reason that I'm so meticulous and I try to stay on top of everything so much,

364
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and not like, this is a new thing.

365
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I never fucking did this in school.

366
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I was a complete fuck up.

367
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But the reason why I do it like my pursuits now is because I don't want there to be any problems

368
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that stop me from doing the things I want to do.

369
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And even the fact...

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay, I'm not saying this at all.

371
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But what if this got to a situation where it was so bad, something happened,

372
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and then you and Jesse, your project just got so fucked up,

373
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
people didn't even want us to be involved with you.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Or you couldn't be a part of the Radcon thing.

375
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's just my nightmare scenario.

376
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it worries me, which is why I want to help if I can.

377
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I know I can't in this particular situation.

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And as you've said, I do think you've made a pretty strong case that I hope the people will be the judge

379
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that was your project, was your project, and the rest of us more than delivered upon the requirements,

380
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
which were zero.

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We did it all for fun.

382
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And we got a free trip.

383
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's true.

384
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Cop to that.

385
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But we did it all the shit because we wanted to, and we want to make more.

386
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And we want to continue to grow and continue to work together on stuff.

387
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So here's my pitch, everybody.

388
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Radcon 3.

389
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's coming.

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
One day, to your fucking face, you better brace for it.

391
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And there might be a Kickstarter thing involved, and I'm telling you, I'm running this shit now.

392
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
All right?

393
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This shit is sailing straight.

394
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Straight into your mom's pussy.

395
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The juiciest location there is, and you better get fucking ready for it.

396
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And you can trust me.

397
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
They trust a tight ship.

398
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The PCP has been a tight-run ship ever since you started taking manager fees.

399
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's been a tight-run ship.

400
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And you can get...

401
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, you know what content can come out of Radcon 3.

402
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There's a lot of shit that we've put out from the last two, you know?

403
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
More lectures, people.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
God, everyone loves the lectures, right?

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You want the more lectures.

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I know you want the lectures.

407
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You fucking plebes out there.

408
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's Radcon 3.

409
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That's it.

410
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And maybe we can...

411
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Maybe if we can raise enough money, maybe we can get a better space for it.

412
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And if it's not tied to something that is basically a me and Jesse project,

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
like, we can market it much better as well.

414
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Like, everyone's channels can advertise the fucking thing.

415
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Absolutely.

416
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Like, because last time it was just me, because that was the only one with the real audience.

417
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Now we've got, like, you've got 50K, you know?

418
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Like, we've got...

419
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Everyone's kind of growing now.

420
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So there's more room for us to try to do something a little bit more.

421
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Not ambitious in terms of the videos getting made,

422
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
because Plebe and the Weeb was too ambitious of a project, just by sheer size.

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Like, honestly, it should have been crowdfunding three episodes.

424
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I agree.

425
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It should have been a crowdfunding for three episodes of the Plebe and the Weeb.

426
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It should not have been 20 episodes.

427
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That was fucking stupid on my part.

428
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
People, it probably would have made the same fucking amount of money for three episodes.

429
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's why I keep emphasizing that I don't think the backers are, like, that broken up about it.

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because already episode one is twice the length of what anybody expected the episodes to be.

431
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You know, I do want to say...

432
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And there was a shit load of bonus background content, you know?

433
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, like, that's all, like, done.

434
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Isn't that, like, all out?

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's all completed?

436
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, everything's...

437
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Basically, everything from Radcon 2 is out, except for the Plebe and the Weeb,

438
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and a few more Blue Glows that Jesse still has.

439
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Actually, all the Blue Glows from Radcon might be out as well.

440
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think that might be the case.

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, yeah? Okay.

442
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, to me, it's honestly baffling how chill everybody is

443
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that just, like, the Plebe and the Weeb is not fully out yet.

444
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Because it wasn't that much money.

445
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Like...

446
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's true.

447
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Like, when you look at it in terms of, it's a Kickstarter...

448
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Like, everyone's so afraid of, like, the ghost of failed Kickstarter.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But, like, most of the famous failed Kickstarter's were a huge amount of money.

450
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And the thing is that the people who complain about them are usually not so much the backers

451
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
as people looking at it from the outside and saying,

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you made that much money and you failed, you fuck up.

453
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But the thing is that Kickstarter is investment.

454
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And if you're participating, you're an investor.

455
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Investors are used to failure.

456
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You're basically hoping this thing will work.

457
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Maybe you'll get something out of it.

458
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Maybe you won't, you know?

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But, like, I think that for the people who backed it,

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
most of them probably paid $15, $30.

461
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And they got a lot of shit out of it, you know?

462
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's for sure.

463
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And there's still a promise that they will get what they actually paid for, you know?

464
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Like, if I came out and said it's canceled and there's none left,

465
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
like, this is all we're releasing, I could understand being more angry.

466
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But, like, this show will come out, you know?

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Like, one way or another, it will come out.

468
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay, last point, just on that specific thing,

469
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
again, to play Devil's Addict there,

470
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
do you feel it all the sense that, like, if it takes that long,

471
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it's almost like it never came out?

472
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know, like, if it really does take at this pace,

473
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
if it takes, like, four years for every episode to come out,

474
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
like, will people even care, you know?

475
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't know how many people will care.

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I think there's lots of shows that have done things that way,

477
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
shows that just take forever to come out, you know?

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Mr. Plinkett still has an audience,

479
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and though he releases one Plinkett every year,

480
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but it's always a big deal when it comes out, you know?

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Again, I don't think The Plebe and the Weeb was ever, like,

482
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
the highest class of content that we make,

483
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so I don't know if it'll be missed the way a Mr. Plinkett video would be missed, you know?

484
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But, like, for me, I think of everything in the long term anyways.

485
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like, I have video series that people think I've killed

486
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and then I bring it back a year later

487
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and everyone's excited that it's back, you know?

488
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Like, I think people think of this in a very impatient short-term way,

489
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but, like, part of investment is the long haul.

490
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Like, Kickstarter usually takes years to finish.

491
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Like, the vast majority of them take two or three years.

492
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, I think the only problem here is just that, you know,

493
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you did give a time frame, and that's really the issue at hand.

494
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The thing is, I gave a time frame that was absolutely ridiculous

495
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
because I was imagining if I was editing it, you know?

496
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because I work insanely fast.

497
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
If the plebeine that we've had been something I was editing,

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it might have been, like, a fifth as good,

499
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but it would have been out in a month, you know?

500
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Like, all of it would have been out in a month.

501
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because that's how I work.

502
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I do want to give Jesse all the credit in the world

503
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
for the obvious love and dedication he puts into it,

504
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
which is why when I think about, you know,

505
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
the discussion about, like, me editing one of the episodes,

506
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
like, I don't want to because I know I can't do it as well as Jesse can.

507
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Jesse just, he's got the spark.

508
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And by Christ, I want it back.

509
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Jesse, make more content. Please, come back to us.

510
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I miss you so much.

511
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I miss him, too.

512
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But, like, the, there is an episode that, like,

513
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
would make more sense if you edited it.

514
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But see, I want Jesse.

516
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I want, I want to be enveloped by Jesse's, by his panache.

517
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
By his fucking, yes, that's what I want.

518
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't want my interpretation of that.

519
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That'd be fucking bullshit.

520
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's exactly why I don't want to take it from him.

521
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like, I think, I think the project, I think the people funding the project

522
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
will ultimately be happier to get the product they wanted

523
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
as opposed to getting a product fast, you know?

524
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I hope so.

525
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Like, if you can't have, like, it would be nice if you could have both,

526
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but you can't have both because the way to get the product you want

527
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
is to milk it out of the most talented man in the world

528
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
who needs to be away from the internet for the next however long he wants to be.

529
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You know?

530
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like, that's the nature of, of what's going on.

531
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So, like, yeah.

532
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But I don't think that should affect the rest of the PCP.

533
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And I think we should be able to, like, I think if people,

534
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't think people will have any fear about it getting done

535
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
if you're the one running it, you know?

536
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I agree.

537
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like, even if they were completely disappointed in the other Kickstarter,

538
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you can look at this one and say, well, Nate's running it,

539
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
so I know we're going to get over it.

540
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The whole thing would start.

541
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The whole thing would start with a careful analysis of what is actually

542
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
a reasonable expectation for what we can actually get done at a radical.

543
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It would all be framed around that to begin with.

544
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And that's really, that's the most important step when it comes to this shit.

545
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Um, yeah.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And, you know, there's one other point I did want to make in here,

547
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and, uh, and it's, okay, it sounds a little odd,

548
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but is it cruel to Jesse to keep him under the yoke of this?

549
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Like, as a fellow creator, if I had, like, nine episodes,

550
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
like 20 episodes or whatever of a show just, like, hanging above me,

551
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
like a fucking sword of Damocles every day as, like, this is, I have to do this.

552
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It, it seems nightmarish.

553
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It seems horrible.

554
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, if it, if it was that way, we've all offered to take it off his hands.

555
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Like, everyone's offered that.

556
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So if he doesn't want to do it, he can pass it up.

557
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But, like, I think he wants to do it because he has a vision of it.

558
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And he likes the series.

559
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He likes the idea, you know?

560
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's just, like, again, it's just bad timing.

561
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Like, maybe next year, maybe, like, February 2018,

562
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
something clicks in his head and he finishes the rest of the show in a week.

563
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You know?

564
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like, I've seen him do that before.

565
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I've seen the way this man works.

566
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Horse Shoe Finale was in production for a fucking year.

567
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You know?

568
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And he disappeared for six months of that year.

569
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
There was a long period with no new Jesse uploads.

570
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Then there was a thousand of them.

571
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You know?

572
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm not saying that's gonna happen.

573
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Don't expect your hopes up.

574
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, let's just, but it has happened before.

575
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Let's just think for a second about the worst case scenario,

576
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
where Jesse just thinks, yeah, fuck it.

577
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And he leaves.

578
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And he never makes it.

579
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He gives me it.

580
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You know?

581
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I take all the, I take the, I have all the files.

582
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You know?

583
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh, okay.

584
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay.

585
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So that's the, that's the critical mass points.

586
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Everything's, everything's in my head.

587
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Like, the second, the second I get the text from Jesse that says,

588
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I fucking hate the plebe of the weave.

589
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I don't want to edit it anymore.

590
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I go, all right.

591
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Hippo, Nate, how much do I have to pay per episode?

592
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You know?

593
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Cause I know if I edit, it's going to be garbage.

594
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So.

595
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'll have to get creative.

596
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah.

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I wouldn't, I would love a Ghib edited episode.

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I know that boy could do some good things.

599
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah.

600
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I think Hippo could do it well.

601
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think it wouldn't be the same, but he could edit.

602
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah.

603
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And it would be funny.

604
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah.

605
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Of course.

606
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
DeVoo could probably edit one.

607
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We got a lot of editors in our midst.

608
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We do.

609
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We do.

610
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But there's only one who's a, who's, who's got a specific brand of genius mania.

611
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know?

612
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah.

613
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
There's only one Tarzan boy out there.

614
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
He's just waiting for him to come home.

615
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Jungle nights, far away from nowhere.

616
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm getting nostalgic.

617
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah.

618
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I know, right?

619
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
All right.

620
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Well, so down in the comments.

621
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let us know, everybody.

622
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Way in.

623
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

624
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Be our judge and jury.

625
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Beneath, right after you're done with your comment, ripping on me for defending my failed

626
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Kickstarter, go ahead and leave a comment about whether or not you think the PCP can do

627
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
a Kickstarter.

628
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Just let us know.

629
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Would you fund Radcon three with the promise that it's going to have for sure all the things

630
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,300
that Radcon two had besides the plea in the weeb, as well as potentially new projects

631
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,080
that we haven't even dreamed up yet.

632
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,820
I think it is almost guaranteed the people will want that.

633
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,080
That is what I think.

634
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,000
And if we, if we firm it that way.

635
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

636
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Sounds good to me.

637
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Here you go, folks.

638
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Digi has taken full responsibility.

639
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
All right.

640
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No blame on this side of the fence, everybody.

641
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
No accountability whatsoever.

642
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There you go.

643
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
There you go.

644
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So there it is.

645
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm, you know, I think this is good.

646
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,680
I think people will be happy to hear us talking about it.

647
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,680
You voicing an opinion on it and just, just giving an update, giving an update to this

648
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
whole situation.

649
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
I think it's good.

650
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Yeah.

651
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
That's what I would want to hear if I were them.

652
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Alrighty.

653
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Suck my dick.

654
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Fuck my ass.

655
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Bye, everybody.

656
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:44,700
I love you.
