15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Reeeee!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,120
All right, we're gonna talk about how much we hate fucking normies now. They all need to fucking burn in Auschwitz

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
We need to reopen Auschwitz and rename it normie Auschwitz, so they all fucking

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,120
Get out it all belong in the norm switch

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,040
Call it norm schwitz. Yeah, let's define what we mean by a normie. Okay. Hang on. They're gonna urban dictionary

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
I'm bringing this back

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,800
After I just made the greatest pun of all time and you deliberately ignored it until you can make your worst pun guy

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,120
I I just make it again. I said call it get out schwitz

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
That's a good one

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm gonna get out of this

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,360
Urban dictionary right now because you've offended me greatly. Well, we'll be sorry to miss you. Yo, my infuror

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,360
I give that a nine out of ten

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay, I don't even know what that means. Normie, a person who does not have a mental illness such as bipolar disorder

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,320
Schizophrenia mood disorders PTSD depression or any other similar mental disability wait

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,040
Wait, wait a reference to those who are a part of the mainstream culture the 97% of the population who doesn't have a mental illness

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,640
Okay, fuck urban dictionary. That's really a fucking normie. I didn't know what that was about. That's a normie definition if ever there was one

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,880
That's exactly right. This is a normative definition of normie and I don't appreciate the

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:21,280
Demonstricizing those fucking colonists fucking assholes because we don't identify with their their fucking identity politics over here on this fucking website

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,040
Fuck them there. They're they're on my shit list. Urban dictionary is dead. Let me let me make a let me make a thing here

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,440
My one of my favorite mangas ever Watamote. I mean, I forget what the word they use in Japanese

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,040
But the the main character in the English translation is always railing against normal fags

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,320
She has normal fags. Yes, because yeah, you know what the Japanese word is guy

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,800
There's a specific Japanese word for a person who lives a normal life. I mean no guys. It's just a foreigner

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I don't know because white people are normal

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,040
And I'm gonna Google this I'm gonna come I'm gonna you guys continue the conversation

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm gonna button and completely disrupt the flow and I find out what that's fine

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,840
But we can talk about what a motive cuz what a motive is the perfect example of what we're talking about because because fuck

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
I forget her name. What's her name?

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,520
Koko Riko no Tomoko Tomoko, right Tomoko is is is the greatest human being who's ever lived

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,040
Right, you just have to read her story to understand why everyone else is a fucking piece of shit

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,640
Who doesn't deserve to be in her companionship and all these all these psychosis psychotic breaks from reality

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,280
Are just her escaping to a higher plane which she has the ability to do because she's superior to everybody else

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,040
Okay, okay, I googled it and it looks like the phrase is Ria Jew which means people whose real life is fulfilled

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,000
Jew means Ria Jew. Okay, Jew. I think it's like an ending. It's like a prefix. It's a suffix that means person

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,560
I believe that would be gene. Oh, yeah, he's right. He's right. I don't know man. Whatever. It's the same shit

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Whatever the point is there's a Japanese word for a people whose real life is fulfilled and she rails against the concept of them

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,640
And she's right because I mean there's people whose real life is fulfilled

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,120
And then there's the rest of us that turn to fucking anime and 2d and and and and all that and all that bullshit

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah, to fill the hole

54
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,600
To fill the hole that that that real life has left in our hearts

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah, that character that Tomoko character and then did you made a video about that Tomoko character and watching that video

56
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Got me thinking about my life and I asked myself

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,000
Why did I always say weird stuff that made everyone mad or annoyed mostly?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,440
And I think like fuck the blacks whites are the supreme race

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
It was for everyone would have agreed

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,320
Not really anyway the point is I really looked back on myself and I realized that it was just because I was bored

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,320
Everywhere I went I didn't have anything to say to these people

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,180
I could have had a normal social life with all of these people if I had been like all of them because you know

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,400
It starts off like this. Hey, hi. I'm David. Hi, and that's

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,640
David I just met you, but you're a fucking normie. So go now. Fuck you. Yes

65
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,800
I went down like you know what I just realized everyone will sit down and be like fucking topic that we hey

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Would you what you know?

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,400
Oh, yeah, you know, I had a sandwich yesterday. Oh, yeah, I had a sandwich yesterday, too

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,080
That's normal life. That's real people right there sitting down at a table. They're like

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
But I'm sitting here

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,960
So now I'm sitting there at the table being like I don't care what sandwich you made

71
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,800
I try to get into interesting stuff like what's your favorite movie or what's your favorite something?

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,400
What are your thoughts on life all these interesting things and they don't answer respond to any of it

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:55,440
They're not receptive to any of it. Hey, bitch, let's fuck and she's like, you know, it's like fuck you, dude

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
You don't know me. What's up with that?

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,920
Let me stop you right there. Let me respond to the view in a more meaningful way

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:10,840
Okay, I can totally appreciate your your your desire to just say things that just upset people out of boredom, right?

77
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
People I was trying to get I was just trying to have something happen

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Yeah, well, you're just trying to entertain

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,840
I don't know if I was if I was eating a meal with someone and they started spouting off some like what's your philosophy and what do you believe?

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,800
Shit, I'd be like shut up. I only have a go man. Yeah, Jesse

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,840
I'm with you. I mean, I mean much better much more carefully selected when I was younger

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,720
I had I wanted to like dive into deep concepts and like talk about meaningful shit all the time

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,640
But now that I'm a little bit older and a little bit wiser

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,960
I really think that all that stuff is just a bunch of bullshit

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,740
Not I didn't ask but I was just had to come up with an example geez I didn't ever ask what your philosophy

86
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,540
All right, well, that's what you said dude. That's what you fucking said and nor me right now

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,120
Right. Well, the point is I'm trying to have something interesting happen

88
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,520
Nothing happened that was ever interesting. It was boring and I hated it

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,080
And I'm now a socially normal person because I don't make myself go out and hang out with people who were boring for five

90
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,640
I'd like to quickly redefine normie as anyone that I dislike. Yeah, that's yeah, you know

91
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Yeah, that's basically what it comes down. I mean, we're all here to rail against normies the concept of but really I mean

92
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
I have a normie story

93
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,320
It was not much but I was in the library the other day doing

94
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,320
the thing I do, you know Jack in my dick and

95
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
There's a guy behind me and I heard he was talking about video games

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,880
I was like, oh, that's cool. He's a video game guy, you know, because usually people are talking about normal bullshit

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Yeah, and I was just sort of eavesdropping on him and then he was talking about yeah, I don't know about crash

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,880
You've seen that the naughty dogs you blah blah blah the last of us is really good

99
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,600
It's my favorite game ever and the new on-charted is amazing because it feels like you're playing a movie and I'm like

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Truly get video games the highest they can aspire to is to be as good as a movie

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,520
What I was impressed just by the fact that he knew crash. I was gonna say yeah, that's kind of

102
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,800
I mean, how old was this guy? It was about my it's the library at my university. So it was about my age

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,600
I remember one episode of your let's play where you're talking about how like when you were a kid

104
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,880
Everyone was into Pokemon

105
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
But then one year later everyone got out of Pokemon and then in college

106
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,440
Everyone pretends to have not still loved Pokemon secretly where they'll go remember Pokemon

107
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,840
Remember back when we were kids who liked Pokemon. Yeah

108
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,640
But now we're the day when liking Pokemon is totally normalized so that people who don't even really give a shit about it

109
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,080
We'll say that they love Pokemon just so you know

110
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,520
It makes a complex situation being a normie, you know, they would be like tough. Yeah, this what were they called?

111
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,060
Pokeballs. I think that's what they were called. I don't

112
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,500
I don't care people as that as that nerds are just ahead of the curve man, you know

113
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah, I gotta I gotta get into this. All right. Okay. We got to figure out what the fuck what the fuck makes a normie

114
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Yeah, I we're still like way

115
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
far away from

116
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,020
So look, okay, I think this is the difference. I think that I think the normal people I

117
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,340
Think that normal is is sort of something that that is performed and that people try to

118
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,660
Try to chase after it. I think most people look at what everyone else is doing and they sort of make themselves that

119
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,620
They listen to people like let's say you're overhearing a conversation where someone's like, haha

120
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,060
That guy's wearing cargo pants. What a nerd and then everyone goes, okay

121
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,180
Well mental note never wear cargo pants because it makes me a nerd. Yeah

122
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,500
But then there's people who are the the not normies who hear that and go what the fuck

123
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,140
But I like cargo pants and they keep wearing it anyway, and that's where you go off the beaten path and become the not normie

124
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,700
Yeah, I think that's something that that sort of happens as a result of either not understanding

125
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,140
What or why the normal people are doing what they're doing or not just not wanting to do it wait a minute like for me

126
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,420
I kind of just didn't get what the well where where those people were coming from, you know

127
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,020
Everyone was like what the fuck are you doing? You're wearing Pokemon shirts, and I'm like, yeah, Pokemon's cool, you know

128
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,700
Yeah, I mean at the end of the day that really is it like there's nothing like if you're wearing like a death note shirt

129
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,140
Okay, which I did death note is awesome death note is a really good serious

130
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,260
Especially if you're like yeah, and the thing is that though the people who everyone else around you the reason they're not wearing that shirt

131
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,060
Is that everyone else thinks it's not okay? Yeah, you know everyone else is like hey death

132
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,460
You're wearing a gay shirt, and you're like, you know

133
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,180
It's your kind of inability to process the idea that you need to change to be like everybody else

134
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,060
Everyone else I don't think that a normie is something like it's not something you can rigidly define like if you do this and this and this

135
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,120
You are a normie. I think that it comes in like aspects like everybody has normally things about them

136
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,940
Like normie is like porn. There's no definition, but you know it when you see it. That's true

137
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,980
Well, that's true what I'm getting is that like everyone is a normie in some ways like

138
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,860
Like my fucking like my friend Dylan who's been like my friends in high school

139
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,740
I know for a fact. He's a fucking freak. He used to fucking he used to like like stand around on the farm naked and fucking

140
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,740
Two tribal dances and shit and fucking swim out into into the middle of a puddle in like a fucking box like a canoe

141
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,120
In the middle of a puddle, okay, yeah, he's a fucking he's a fucking freak man

142
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,080
But but he also has like a normal you're referring to Lake Erie when you say a puddle. Yeah, yeah, okay

143
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,680
Just check him so like so in some ways, you know

144
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,760
He's just as big of a fucking weirdo and a nerd as me

145
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,520
But in other ways he has a normal job and stuff and kind of a normal life

146
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,120
He lives in an apartment with his girlfriend. So in that way, they're filthy degenerate. Yeah

147
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah, there's sometimes is like a wedge between me and the rest of the world

148
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,920
I mean, I gotta try to I gotta make what the hell is wrong with you

149
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm talking up. I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve here. I'm sorry, Jesse. I'm trying to understand

150
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm picking up what you're throwing down. Jesse. I want to fight just can't wait to get in there with something

151
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,720
Jesse, I'm gonna ask you a fucking question. All right

152
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,720
Let's hear it Jesse. I want to spice up this conversation by asking you and everyone else eventually

153
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Do you feel sometimes that you are either to normie or not normie enough?

154
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,160
Well, that's what I was just fucking getting to but yeah, well, I wanted to make it a topic

155
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
So I knew you were going there go for it

156
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I'll don't be a bitch

157
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,280
Flustered and flung I have a counter question. I do I do feel like no tofu fuck you Jesse has to answer my question first

158
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Do you feel sometimes that you're either to normie or not normie enough in everyday life

159
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,480
Nobody answer this as if you're talking about your prior self talk about right now

160
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,720
Yes, okay as I was saying before did you ruined it for like a 20 minute train wreck just then

161
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
Because of what I do

162
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,340
My norminess has gone so drastically down

163
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,280
To the point where there's a like an even greater wedge between me and the rest of humanity than there ever was before

164
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,080
But like I remember in the years right after high school. Yes, where I was doing good

165
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,920
I would wagger around I talked to girls and stuff

166
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,400
I was young and hot and but then I started doing this YouTube shit

167
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,920
And then I just turned into this mutant that you see before you today

168
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,200
And now it's like like the thing about this job is that you can't relate to anyone in the world because if you work in customer service

169
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,760
And you complain about it. Everybody is with you because everybody's worked in customer service. I cannot

170
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,120
Even talk about my job because nobody understands anything about what I do

171
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,720
It's so weird and the worst is when people pretend that they do understand. That's pretty fucking annoying

172
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, just if if you're a youtuber try explaining to someone else like what a copyright strike is and they're just like oh man

173
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Like they're just like are you in trouble? Is that like it's like just fucking forget about it. Like I'll tell you like and I like I like

174
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,080
Like sometimes like I'll catch myself being not normie enough like I'll

175
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Like sometimes I'll just be sitting don't want to go down into that place

176
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I'll be minding my own business and suddenly like

177
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:44,840
Like it'll all hit me that the stuff that I usually ignore about how fucked up my life is that I just don't notice because I'm not a normie like I

178
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Don't have a car right now. I don't have a phone. I haven't had a phone for six months. My life is in shambles

179
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,920
No, I haven't had a phone for like six months

180
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,240
I I live in a fucking dump and it's like I don't even notice these things because my life is

181
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Creativity, it's what I do for my job and it's what I do for my hobby. So when I get distracted from my job

182
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm still doing my fucking job. I it's all I do is just I make weird stuff

183
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm living this weird artist lifestyle. That's the quintessential non-normie lifestyle

184
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
And I feel like a fucking normie

185
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,640
It's a spectrum my friend it's a spectrum because of that

186
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't have a reason to usually go anywhere

187
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,960
I don't have a reason to call anyone because I hate people anyways. I don't like going out. I fucking I hate everything in the world

188
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,240
So but then like I'll catch myself like hey, wait a minute. Isn't it weird that I don't have a car?

189
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Isn't it weird that I don't have a phone? Yeah, I guess it kind of is pretty fucked up

190
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,560
How did I get to this point, you know, Jesse brief

191
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Yeah, I know what you sometimes I feel like a normie, but then I just look over at my Nico Robin statue and I'm just like

192
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,320
Both Ben and Jesse were saying like cuz I brought this up because I was interested to know

193
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Dude, I can look up her dress right now

194
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,920
Jesse Jesse was saying that he mostly worries about being not normie enough

195
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,280
I have concerns about being too normie sometimes and it's mostly when I hang out like with Jesse because Jesse is

196
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
So

197
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,400
Unhinged and doesn't care and in ways that like well like when I'm in

198
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,640
When I'm in public especially like I I guess because I grew up very like rigidly following the rules

199
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,480
You know, I was never something like not the social rules

200
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,760
But like the rules of like the law kind of you always go pretty normie when you're out and about doing shit

201
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,800
Yeah, well, I just haven't I'm like very afraid of like breaking laws

202
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,680
Like I was just raised in a way to like I you know, I'm extremely conscious about that kind of stuff even in like minor circumstances

203
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
so like if we're at brony con or something and

204
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,800
We're on you know on top of the the building up there. Yeah, and Jesse's like going over the railing and I'm like

205
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Come back

206
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,640
It's really not a big deal and if anything I wish I was the one over there doing that

207
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,160
Leaning over a railing Jesse's fucking unhinged

208
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Well, you

209
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,400
Well see that's what I'm talking about Jesse you don't care about those things that means nothing to you in my mind

210
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,760
All these alarm bells go off because I'm like that's where the rules are that's like that's the law mark that line in the sand

211
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,520
You know that arbitrary marker is where the law ends and begins and in my brain

212
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:48,600
It's like we are now breaking the law. Maybe we should take a step back, you know, but I wish I was the one going over that

213
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,680
I don't think that rules are for cowards, right?

214
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,400
And that applies socially as well. I do too, which is why I feel too normie when I follow the rules that strictly, right?

215
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,360
And Jesse is why I like being drunk in public because then I don't care anymore. That's that's definitely true

216
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,580
Gibbon was saying just the other day

217
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,920
I don't even remember this but he was saying that when we all met up at Brony con like one of the first things

218
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,960
I did was that I just when we laid in our when we went to our hotel

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I just started humping him, which I have no memory

220
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,480
Thing because it just devolved it just dissolved the tension and I'm always thinking that I wish I would do more of that shit

221
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,160
That's what I'm talking about. Well, that's yeah, that's the thing like every time Jesse talks about him and his friends all like showing each other

222
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,520
Like I I feel I feel wrong that I'm not doing that

223
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,320
Yeah, like that I would be so prudish as to like when we all shared a hotel room

224
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, you know, I avoid if Jesse was in the shower

225
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,920
I made sure I didn't go into the bathroom even though I might have had to piss because there was like the bath the fucking tub

226
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,160
Is right next to a shower. I mean, this is why I love stories like the d-club story so much

227
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,800
It's like yeah, these guys are so free. I have a genuine

228
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,040
Of right, you know, yeah, I was just thinking I was like we all need to get it

229
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,680
We all need to get together and do some cock handshakes. Yes, it's like a handshake, but you grab each other's dick

230
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,560
You know, I hadn't thought of it like that until you said something you know, that's the danger

231
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
It's just a cock handshake

232
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,960
Don't get hard I'm gonna tell my therapist in 10 years. Yeah, it was just a cock handshake doctor

233
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,700
Martinovic and 10 years later you're you're

234
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,280
Ideally a cock handshake should be the length of a normal handshake

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,280
It shouldn't go on for like some handshakes. Well, it's pretty long and be pretty satisfying. But all right

236
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,620
All right, so on the subject on back on topic. Yeah, it should be like one of those like like like like secret handshakes

237
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Like where it's really complicated

238
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,620
Some handshakes got to involve the mouth a little bit, you know

239
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,740
All right, what do you back on topic? I want to say that in I don't really consider myself

240
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,500
That normie but like you said before guy. It's on a spectrum right like in a lot of ways

241
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,940
I am normie like you know, I kind of have sex with girls, you know

242
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,940
Ultimate normie act you can commit it is a shame other than marrying them

243
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,380
Marrying them is the normiest thing you can do, you know

244
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,540
Like I I meet girls and stuff and like I go and like I talk to people and like absolutely shameful

245
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
I behave like a generally

246
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,060
Functional member of society on the other hand like I don't have a regular job and like a lot of my income comes from like

247
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,020
Creativity and stuff and like my room my roommates see me as this totally weird

248
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,300
Out there, you know kind of goofy character. Yeah

249
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,140
Oh, so you're that guy to them, huh? I don't I don't see myself as like a crazy wacky person

250
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,300
But they see me as just this like impossible

251
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,380
Confluence of like weird that's cool trades. Yeah, like they're really fascinated by my and they're like, oh, didn't you?

252
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,780
Didn't you make money by making pony videos?

253
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
What the fuck

254
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Com we don't make videos anymore

255
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
And

256
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,060
Everybody pledged to the t-bat patreon on patreon.com slash endless Jess so like so like compared so like compared to my roommates

257
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:33,300
I'm a complete like they're so normie next to me, but like compared to Jesse. I feel like a total normie

258
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,660
I know like I still have have a phone and like

259
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,620
That's another one of those awareness moment for me because when you say it like that

260
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,620
It really doesn't sound like I've become an insane hermit. I mean, I have functional kidneys

261
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,420
I'm living the normal life the normal lifestyle right now. You know, I I sleep on a bed. That's made out of a bed and not garbage

262
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,780
My bed's not in a bed frame like a like a true normie sleeps in a bed in a bed frame

263
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,900
But at least it's a bed and not like a pile of dish right

264
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,740
The frame because I went fuck that yeah, mine also is not in the frame

265
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,140
You know, I can't help but wonder if if it makes it like even less normie that I have like a Casper mattress

266
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,740
That I bought because it's like a podcast recommended it to me like

267
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,220
Does but on the spectrum it's it's it's less weird than having no bed and sleeping on trash as Jesse

268
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Yeah, I don't know. It's funny. I I feel I I kind of a similar status with my friends where I'm like the weird guy

269
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,900
But a lot of them were at least as weird as me until after like they got jobs and like became more

270
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,500
Yeah, yeah, like to to make to make a living in a normal way. You kind of have to become a normie

271
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,220
Yeah, I can get I mean I work a nine-to-five every day of the week

272
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,820
I must super normie and I like no challenging that notion right and then again

273
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,420
By the way, I I really hope that this podcast comes across as like funny and self-aware and not like the most

274
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,700
Autistic thing that's ever happened, but I hope we'll have to we've got a

275
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,700
Let it let it be known that we we understand that

276
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,840
Awareness of normie is like it's totally relative. Yeah

277
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,460
Definitely like the term normie is almost a misnomer because I feel like I'm the only normal fucking person on this planet

278
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,940
I know right when you see those YouTube comments, but yeah, like you know

279
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,100
Like among my friends man like one of my best friends is a dude who when I met him was a

280
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,580
Full-on Hikikomri who hadn't left his room in like years

281
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,500
He was like pissing in bottles and shit because of paranoia and stuff like that

282
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Clarissa

283
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,820
Thousands of anime like he's seen he's seen way more than I ever have and that's saying something

284
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,580
Yeah, I'm known to be a man who's watched a lot of anime, you know

285
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,540
He he had this because he had something called cluster headaches were like every morning at like 6 a.m

286
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,540
He'd get an intense migraine that lasts like a couple hours and as a result

287
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,780
He couldn't come to school most of the time

288
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,860
And the only times he came was like on the first couple days of the year and it just so happens that one day

289
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,420
He was reading like a lucky star book at school

290
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah, yeah, there was a show that no one had heard of at the time if you weren't like well

291
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,420
2006 or 7 or something 2007 yeah, so I started talking to him based on that and like got his

292
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,860
You know his instant messenger handle right before he left school entirely. Yeah, the last day

293
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,700
He was there so me and him became friends and like you know

294
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,660
This is a guy who is about as as weird as it gets right? He's locked himself in his room all he does is watch anime

295
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,860
He's got like Daki Makura pillows everywhere on his fucking walls

296
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,940
He was like he's always slept on the floor just cuz he's a big fat guy and like

297
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:02,500
He's got like that's he has like bad snoring that like you can hear for like like like yards and

298
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,420
Like you can hear it forever

299
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,620
Yeah, he won't sleep over at people's houses because his snoring is so loud that he'll keep you up like

300
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,860
He's just got a lot of odd traits

301
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,620
But then over time he you know and he would he was like a terrified of talking to people

302
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,420
We'd go out to like fast food and I'd have to order for him, you know

303
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,780
Oh, I couldn't talk to people like that

304
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:28,540
But over time this dude has gotten to be so normal because like he started working out losing weight doing diets and stuff

305
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,700
He started talking to people he got a normal job

306
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,380
You know, he's been for almost two years now. He's been like moving cars working for my dad and like now

307
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,540
He's like a completely normal guy all he does is like talk about cars and fucking

308
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,620
Oh, I didn't know this was the guy who one of your friends who started working for your dad. That's awesome

309
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,260
I'm glad he's doing that. Yeah, he he's yeah

310
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,500
He's got a complete he went to college for a couple years on like, you know scholarships and stuff because he's like

311
00:25:51,620 --> 00:26:00,240
He's like yeah, but like now he's like so normie that like I try to talk to him about weird stuff

312
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,460
And he's kind of like he can barely, you know, like he's the only one of my friends who can still like get to that place

313
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,360
And be like yeah, I get where you're coming from

314
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,280
And this is the fundamental difference between even most weird people and those of us in this chat right now

315
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,360
Yeah, right if I it's not just what situation you're in

316
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,720
It's the core of what you want out of reality out of your life

317
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,680
And where does it bring you because I think all of us

318
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,720
Yeah, all of us are gonna either like live off our art or die in a gutter something like that

319
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
I don't know. We're all people well Jesse

320
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,360
Shamefully for me. I'm living the plan B lifestyle right now fine

321
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,200
Which is which makes me ashamed of myself, but I'm doing it, you know, I like to I like to have a house

322
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,240
I'd like to go back to have a part-time job if he needed it for food

323
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
But he hasn't had a part-time job in a while

324
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,840
So I don't trust I mean frankly frankly my job

325
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,320
I've got is so good and I'm expecting like a promotion in a couple months like the amount of work the amount of money

326
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,720
I'll need to make to like equal or even come close to like achieving what I'm doing now

327
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,960
It's good is like puts the level of like my patron. I'll need to get you to go full-time at like so high

328
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,360
It's probably making it harder for me to break away. Yeah. Well anyway, yeah

329
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
In response to my my

330
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
Willingness to go back to work like yeah, if I did go back

331
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,360
It would always be with the idea that I'm going to get out again, right?

332
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,560
Yeah, I got a job the first time under the impression that I was gonna work until I could afford I think it's safe to say that all of us have

333
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,240
Found a legitimate passion in our lives that we're looking to pursue, you know, right?

334
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,640
I mean phrase is better. I didn't phrase it bad. I now want to phrase it better

335
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,280
Most people who are in some sort of weird situation like being locked in their room

336
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,840
We're having a huge medical problem. They are fundamentally drawn to being normal some day and maybe they'll succeed

337
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,680
Maybe most of them succeed, but but for me personally

338
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,680
No matter how normal of a situation. I'm in I am drawn away from it

339
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Like I could right now be like that's true

340
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,640
We can attest to to DeVu not being into having a job whatsoever. He's I well

341
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,840
I gotta I gotta address the guy who's been quiet here Tom who?

342
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,320
Flew just just got back from having flown from like Boston to Vancouver

343
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,600
Yeah, and stayed there for a month and a half with his internet girlfriend

344
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,840
How normally do you feel Tom good question?

345
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,760
Um, I honestly I've been so silent because I don't think about any of this like my social standings or how normally you're on

346
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,600
Normie I'm doing my I don't buy that for one fucking second. I don't know I know you're judging everybody

347
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,880
Don't you don't you take the same perverse pride that we all do

348
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I mean

349
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,960
I know for me that like I can't hold a job like I've told like

350
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,920
Everyone like it's my my family's like because I live with my family still and I make like pittance

351
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,160
I make pennies on the dollar that I used to like right years ago on the internet and they're like pony days, man

352
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,960
You need to get a job, but I'm just like no and they're like why is like because I will probably kill myself

353
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,360
Well, I have a question for you. It's probably the most not normie question ever

354
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Do you feel blame? Are you mad?

355
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,040
Do you feel like who's kebab rath rannage your franage pooch-gooch-booch-google your rammage jiggy-jiggy

356
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Google

357
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
What's being said

358
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,560
Even more like to do the what the in the have more like to do if that's not how it goes, you know

359
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Tom

360
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,720
Have you ever been want to do more look like that's the one well Tom brought up killing himself and really isn't that the way to?

361
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Not be a normie truly

362
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Living is so fucking normal

363
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Dude that was a guy it was like this Jewish guy at MIT. He wrote like a thousand page. He wrote his PhD thesis

364
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:59,560
It was a thousand page manifesto on like Jewish mysticism and like I'm like the subject of life as like an abstract concept

365
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,280
Yeah, and his final conclusion was that life and death are both fundamentally equivalent to each other

366
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,840
I then like the next day

367
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,480
He went out in public and like put on a tuxedo and just like shot himself in the head

368
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,120
I have someone in front of like in front of like a tour group at MIT and you know

369
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,240
Work that guy was too normie for his own good

370
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,400
You know speak of normie

371
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,520
I mean this this very this very channel you're watching this video on right now

372
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,080
I made sure that I was the one who made it and would be financially

373
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,120
Responsible for it in the instance. They were ever to take off and be successful. So just so you know

374
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm always thinking about the shit Machiavellian style in case one of these one of these things is to take off

375
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,320
I want to be the guy who's gonna make the most because I'm here to sabotage it from within well my goal

376
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,760
To make sure none of these guys ever become normies and surpass me in life

377
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,960
I did that with teabag and I made sure I to do it again with with the procrastinator

378
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,520
Tom reminded me because he mentioned work living at home like that the hardest thing for me about trying like if I even

379
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,200
Wanted to try to be normie. It's impossible because my living environment is so fucking bizarre

380
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:14,360
That like it can't happen like I mean aside for the fact that my room itself is giant and covered in posters on every inch

381
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,080
Which I can't I can't escape it now like I've put so much like you said you were going to only over my bed

382
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,600
And there's a bunch of sexy anime girls over my bed

383
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,400
And so now even if I want to like think about something else

384
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,300
I look at my ceiling and I'm just like I guess I'm jacking off the anime girls tonight

385
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,160
You surround yourself with the ideal and I want but uh, that's not a good point

386
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,520
is

387
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,120
How even if we like made an effort to be normie how normie could any of us

388
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,920
Is something that you can wheel yourself to do a suit and got like a normal job and live the normal life

389
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,480
I would still essentially be the same guy who fucking punches teenagers in the movie theater

390
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,080
And that's right family is alcoholics, you know when addicts of all of us

391
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,280
Yes, I think you're the least willing to hold on. Let me finish ready. Okay, my story

392
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,880
Cuz like you guys have seen what the inside of my house looks like right that

393
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,240
My living room is literally a castle. I know but in fight I saw it in that monopoly money music video

394
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,480
Yeah, yeah, it's been in a few videos there. The entire living room is a castle my

395
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,740
Like you can't you can't just like live in there and think like this is a house

396
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,720
It's impossible like you go in there and you're like what the fuck do I live in this is madness, you know

397
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,640
And my my brother Victor because Victor is like the guy who's trying to escape and become the normie guy, right?

398
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,440
Right, he's like a you know like in the in the boys in the hood

399
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,120
In boys in the hood where there was the one kid who wanted to go to college and escape the gangster life

400
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah, yeah, that's Victor. He's trying to get out of here go to LA

401
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,120
He's just too gangster, right well, but it's funny though because like

402
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:04,000
Compared like we all always say like oh Victor's going to become the most normie guy of all because he does work that deals with other people

403
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,160
And it's like a job that already exists

404
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:15,720
But filmmaking is the most not normie job before we existed like up until the existence of you of YouTube and people making up their

405
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,480
Own jobs out of thin air like we did like nothing was less normie than going off to Hollywood to become an artist

406
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,520
But like from our perspective it's like oh Victor's gonna go be the normie one

407
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,560
But he's always talking about like how for him

408
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:35,520
it's hard to like get into the mindset of being an adult because of the fact that he lives at home in a home that is so like

409
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,280
It's so massive and so like

410
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,720
Over-decorated and designed where like you know my mom's office is nothing but toys because she's like a toy collector

411
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
You know our living rooms a fucking castle my room is full of posters

412
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,760
You can't go anywhere in this house and just feel like a normal guy. It's impossible

413
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,060
You know my parents aren't really that like my dad is super normie, but my mom is not very

414
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,600
Normie, you know, so yeah, so you can't escape it. It's and even though my dad is super normie

415
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,480
He's also the guy who made it a fucking castle, so he's not that he's still got his own

416
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,400
He's guilty of conspiracy to commit and apparently he has like a huge

417
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Exhaustive memory of movies because he just remembers all the movies he watches. Yeah, that's pretty not mine between

418
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,920
I don't know. I think that's more normie than you think I think I think a lot of people can

419
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,400
Movies are very normie these days

420
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,800
I think the line between normie and not normie is really thin and I think it's getting even thinner right

421
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,940
And I think even today like I think even in the past everyone had sort of like this pop cultural

422
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,080
Sensibility about the most everyone was to some degree tuned into like you know movies and music and like art stuff

423
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,480
That is not exactly no

424
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,680
It's not it's not normie like going to work nine to five is normie

425
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:54,880
Yeah, and you know like drinking in bars is normie, but it's not it's not I think the internet is slowly blowing the doors off

426
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,720
Yeah, and yeah, that's the thing and I mean now it is stuff like us is accessible to people to stuff

427
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,200
Right who aren't yeah culture is more accessible to everyone

428
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,000
So everyone's more exposed to it and just the whole the whole thing about like nerd culture like the whole nerd pride thing

429
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,800
And how being a nerd is cool now like I think today

430
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,800
The normiest thing you can be is like a little bit not normie, you know

431
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Not

432
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,240
It's niche to be just a straightforward like corporate guy now, that's it's only square

433
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,520
Like normie get less and less normie until the point where like we're normie

434
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,920
The internet is causing like every group that exists was a kind of kind of existed in its own little circle

435
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,280
But the internet's allowing people to form smaller and smaller communities of like many people like us that

436
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,760
People even more to bring it out to like a broader perspective, you know like we all grew up on

437
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,540
Cartoons that would show high school or or even TV shows that would show high school is like this very like

438
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,680
Fragmented like here's the jocks. Here's the the the nerds

439
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Here's the Goths, you know, like that's how you should always be presented and for a lot of places in America

440
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,880
Especially in middle America

441
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,800
It's still like very much like that where people still get beat up for being gay or get beat up for this and that you know

442
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,400
like for being nerds and stuff, but like

443
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,200
At the high school I went to all the clicks had kind of bled together like everybody knew someone in another

444
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,720
Click like we had we had a bunch of skater kids who stood around and a bunch of goth kids who stood around

445
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,440
But they weren't like enemies. They kind of knew each other and yeah, that's true

446
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,920
Clicks weren't that code they really weren't they really and it was largely because like Facebook had made it so everybody

447
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Knows what's going on with everybody else anyways, so I don't know

448
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,720
There was Facebook so much as they didn't really exist that much in the reality

449
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,320
Facebook only became a thing like after we got to call like like right when we were going to college and it was like college

450
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,760
Well, you say Nate that it wasn't a thing ever, but I don't know cuz like

451
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Tropes that were

452
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,560
Not a lot of people on forums who have told who like are from the Midwest who have made it sound like they're high school like super was

453
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,400
Okay, well me and then we're on we're in Massachusetts, so I mean

454
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:35,600
There's and we're from big cities, so like it's a little more small town, but nonetheless east coast. Yeah, but yeah

455
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,440
I think this coast is a little bit because we have like I guess the best way to put it is we have a lot of black people and

456
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,440
Like I think the fact that we're not racist has a lot to do with you

457
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,240
That's true of you me and Ben went to a pro almost entirely white school

458
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,040
They were like a couple Asians couple black people here and now you hate

459
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,560
And yeah, now we're super racist as a result, of course

460
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,200
But the the the thing about that is that like it's true

461
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,040
We do I mean I mean I mean I knew from like I

462
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,760
Knew culture like culturally. I was told that racism was bad. I just didn't get very much

463
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,480
Let's just talk about clicks, you know, we're talking about you know being an army and like at our school

464
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,120
Like I remember pretty much everyone. I went to school very well

465
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:30,280
And there really was like at the very like there were opportunities to join whichever click you wanted to the thing

466
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,720
Is that when you're a high schooler you're super retarded and you don't know what the fuck you're doing with your life

467
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,360
If you wanted to join a click it would be super easy

468
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,680
You just need to put in a tiny amount of effort to like express interest in whatever they're doing and show that you're not a

469
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,800
Complete fuck-up, but I mean those high schools are not capable of that

470
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,280
I felt like a fucking insane person in high school because I I looked at all the clicks and I didn't get it like I didn't get well

471
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,680
I hung out with the goth kids, but they all actually looked like

472
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,360
Goth kids. They actually wore the makeup. They actually

473
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,120
Was a kid I hung out with the goth kids, too. I was the least gothie of the goth

474
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:10,840
Yeah, that was I was in with I was the guy real goths. I mean I had I had bondage pants from hot topic

475
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:20,080
Did you hang on Ben did at one point write a letter to game informer explaining why goth culture was legit

476
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,240
That's not what my letter to game informer was about my letter to game informer was about that

477
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,000
I really liked the Wheel of Time series and I really wanted them to fucking

478
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,440
Whether there were any video game tie-ins coming out since you hung out with that click

479
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,920
Did you ever read Johnny the homicidal maniac? No, I was not I was not aware of that and so

480
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
this was hilarious to me right because I

481
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,200
In high school I hung out with that goth click and it was all all kids, you know who dressed the part they

482
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,160
They had my my chemical romance. They had the all-black. Yeah, they had the my chemical romance shirts

483
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,040
They have the you know

484
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,800
They listened to those bands and went to those shows and stuff like that

485
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
They were all fucking potheds to at least half of them

486
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,640
And I was the one who was like I was I was over there

487
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,880
You know with those guys hanging out with like the nerdier ones because there was a lot of overlap between nerds and goths in my school

488
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,040
You know, yeah, like so I was at the nerdy goth kids and I just dressed like a fucking freak

489
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,880
I had like my my super long hair that went down to my ass

490
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:20,560
I had the scraggly ass horrible beard the fucking like random anime t-shirts and shit dirty ass clothes

491
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,080
And I smelled like farts, but ripped apart leaking. So I had to plug it

492
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,200
So one of those goth kids one time gave me

493
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,120
One of those goth kids let me read Johnny the homicidal maniac

494
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,000
And it was really funny because the whole thing is a criticism of like click culture

495
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,600
It's all about how much Joan and Vazquez hates God

496
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:50,440
Yeah, like all of the goth kids absolutely love Johnny the homicidal maniac because they all think they're the good ones

497
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm like, how did the person who loaned me this not understand they are exactly what this is about

498
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,960
We are self-aware in this chat right and almost no one else is in the universe

499
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,360
It's like no one else knows what we know we're the smartest people in the world

500
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:23,800
We're fucking geniuses. Listen, listen, there's a pair. There's a parallel. There's a there's an idea forming idea eating in my neurons

501
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,640
It's like we here talking about this are like Joan and Vazquez

502
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,720
Pointing out that we everyone including ourselves is all just pretending and we're all and by you know the goth sit around talking about the

503
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Preps and how and how foolish they are, but they don't realize how foolish they look not realizing that they themselves

504
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,440
The goths and the vampires and the emos were all calling one another posers and so they

505
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,520
They got the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe. Yeah reanimated and he called all of them posers

506
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,360
He would he would he's the biggest record. I don't think I think we have shown that there is a level on which we admire

507
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,800
Norminess and yeah, true and like we're more we're not so much saying that being

508
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
respect for normies

509
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,040
Like I mean I I would never completely reject norminess. I mean

510
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,600
I think we're distinguishing ourselves without saying that we're necessarily better for being I see I see normies

511
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:29,800
And I see like something that I could never be but that like it's like a normal person looking at like Superman or something, right?

512
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,440
Normies are truly superior. Yeah, I think that maybe I think maybe there's no such thing as a true normie

513
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,160
I think that normie nest absolutely correct is like it's like a platonic ideal

514
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,800
Yes, and there is some like hypothetical theoretical perfect normie archetype

515
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,200
But no one right when we recognize traits of norminess and people we can call them a normie

516
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I've come to realize I

517
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,200
Think I just understood why I can't be normie was that I think that if I tried I would always come back to

518
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,920
Because if you try we'd reject you if you ever have you ever read the book The Stranger

519
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,000
absolutely by Camus of course yeah, or

520
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,840
Alternatively seen the play waiting for God. Oh that the stranger was about a guy who was the biggest

521
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,680
Non-normie of all so hard that he had to murder everyone the guy's way think about he only killed one

522
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,160
He only think about the guy for the stranger is that from his perspective

523
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,240
Nothing he did was that weird, you know, he was just like I went to my mother's funeral

524
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,040
I didn't really feel like crying so he didn't cry

525
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,280
Yeah, and then later on he just kind of ends up killing a guy

526
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,840
And then they use the fact that he didn't cry at his mom's funeral against the sense him

527
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,280
Yeah, and then like he's you know getting executed at the end and he kind of has like this breakdown where he's like

528
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:51,760
I don't understand like I don't get what has happened here, and he's just like I feel you know distant from it

529
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,000
The play waiting for God. Oh meanwhile is about these two guys waiting for a good dough waiting for good

530
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,280
Oh

531
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,360
They go out they go out to this bench every day, and they're waiting for God. Oh, and they

532
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Can't say that good. Oh, it's easy

533
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
It's fucking

534
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,920
Talking about how they're gonna kill themselves or about how they're gonna do this and that or about how this whatever's gonna happen

535
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,600
But the point is they just go out every day and nothing fucking up waiting for gay dough

536
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,800
It's there always just waiting around guy, which is like I feel like whatever I don't ever think of like

537
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
But if I think of the idea of becoming

538
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,800
Enormy like all those like absurdist ideas flood into my head, and I'm just like what is the meaning of anything like why?

539
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,680
Like I could die tomorrow, and none of this will matter like putting effort into being anything is is like meaningless

540
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,440
Putting it oh that ties right into our last podcast where we talked about this very topic

541
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Yeah, the idea of trying to create a self-identity is so strange to me like like nothing that I am right is like something

542
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I went after being that guy

543
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Wasted effort come objective

544
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,040
The way I keep my hair and beard is because I'm too lazy to get it cut and then when I cut it

545
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,560
It just all goes you know it's like there's no there's no sense of like crafting a self

546
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,840
It's myself is like the untethered expression of what interests me at the time

547
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,120
It just so happens I've been into cartoons since I was a kid, and I love writing about them

548
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,600
So that's why I write about anime. It's not like I'm trying to create this this idea of myself as the the anime guy

549
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,440
It's just like that's what I am the anime man has that in the market cornered

550
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
You know no challenge that guy um

551
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:37,600
But yeah like to me like if I try if I think about like what if I tried to create a self-image and like become this person

552
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,880
And then it's like you could spend like a year doing that and like getting towards this this eventuality

553
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,400
And then get hit by a truck and die and then like the universe is meaningless

554
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,120
Why are you trying to do anything just like live by your?

555
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,360
By your instinct you know yeah like I want to like live on my own

556
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,200
I want to like have a relationship

557
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I want to have a car and I want to have

558
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,080
Disposed I want to have a relationship those things with standards because those things are desirable. I want them

559
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,920
Yeah, like I wouldn't I would not mind having all those things

560
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,480
But I I and I and I also think if you're working towards it

561
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,200
That's not the same thing as being normie is just being goal-driven, you know

562
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,760
I think yeah, I think the more normie attitude would be the the the girl who like gets knocked up and then keeps the baby

563
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,600
And marries the guy even though they have no love for each other because it's just

564
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,600
Yeah, I just sort of consider that to be like one of the most like one of the most intense expressions of norminess

565
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,280
Like because like I have older cousins who get married like they're all female they get like two of them

566
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,320
Like right I feel you on this fuck them well like

567
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,280
Yeah, I have these two older cousins who've gotten like who are like in their 30s now

568
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,960
And they've gotten like oh, I would definitely have sex with them or married like a

569
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:01,080
Bunch load of times. It's always just like to some generic guy with like tattoos. I'm like this looks like

570
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,840
And with tattoos

571
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,880
It just seems like that seems like the most normie thing like one of the most intense expressions

572
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,240
The quintessential focus point of being normie is to not be self-critical not be self analytical

573
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,120
Is that what we talk about the saddest outcome that I think most like normies have

574
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,680
This is what happened to like

575
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,000
Everyone on my mom's side of family like all my all my aunts and uncles like they they started off like living

576
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,560
The normie life right like they got made they had kids and then at some point everything went horribly wrong

577
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,320
But they stuck with them. They know that here's the thing in their minds

578
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,440
They're still like a part of that like that that's still who they are. They're still like normal

579
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,280
Yeah, but they're totally not at all like there are a bunch of fucking weirdos like you know my aunt like

580
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,840
Went crazy and just like now all she does is smoke weed constantly and like and

581
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,600
Weird diet, but like in her mind

582
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,440
She is a normal person who is like trying to get you know like oh my life is gonna be back on track soon

583
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,280
You know, it's like it's never happening. You're you've lost your mind somewhere along the line

584
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,440
You don't get that. Yeah, I think that's what happens to a lot of like

585
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,160
I don't know maybe it's just in my family

586
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,160
But like I know a lot of people who are like in their 50s and have it

587
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,720
The other shoe hasn't dropped and they haven't realized that their life is totally not normal

588
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,080
They still think that they're working towards like getting stability back, but it's never coming back

589
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:45,320
Yeah, I think of all these like failed relationships as a super normie expression is because it's like they're doing it because

590
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,640
I mean, I understand if you have specific reasons like a pregnancy happened

591
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,480
But if you're doing it just for like just to do it it really shows this weird conformity of yeah

592
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,840
Oh, I'm kind of like doing that because like that's what's socially accepted like I'd even say happen like not having an abortion

593
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:06,800
Even when it's obviously the thing to do in your particular circumstance is just is a very normie thing to do

594
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
You know

595
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,080
See it sounds like you're like a thousand feet from the microphone suddenly what

596
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
Sounds like you're all the way across the room

597
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,960
Well, I don't know the stats on that I I mean I could have been told either way getting an abortion

598
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,760
I'm just saying that like to do things without

599
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,040
Like when I was like that's what being a normie is when I was seven

600
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,440
I had learned the statistic that half of marriages end in divorce and I know right

601
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,600
Well, then clearly I'm only going to do it when I'm like at least 98 percent sure that it's gonna work out

602
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,400
But so right we'll just go into it. It's like didn't you see the stat? What else would you do that had a 50%?

603
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,960
That you have to that you have to do this thing because it's expected of you

604
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,280
Intense norminess right just just the other day. I was lying on the floor in a depressed stupor

605
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,600
Regretting every decision. I made in my life up to that point and I just thought to myself

606
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,680
You know what you were pulling a naps to blue. That's right at that moment

607
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,200
I thought to myself you know what you know what I could get married

608
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,720
I could give myself to someone just you know and be done with it, but then as soon as I stopped doing that

609
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,880
I realized that's a terrible idea. I think that's where it comes from

610
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,600
Normies have no hope and nothing to live for and that's exactly depressed because they're why I mean

611
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,160
So I mean we all we all we hear all live for our art right true

612
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:38,000
We all we all live for our creative outlets and for the purpose of creating something that you know will impact people and

613
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,720
Maybe you know stand the test of time and and and and continue on. Yeah

614
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,360
I'm all that and pussy on my face. You know what I'm fucking saying guys

615
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,100
But yeah pussy just no no no shut up shut up fuckers

616
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,940
And fucking the the point is most people don't have that yeah, that's true

617
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,940
And I read I think that I think that I don't think that the difference between normie and not normie is that well-defined

618
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,160
But I think that if there is one yeah, I think that's probably

619
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,260
Cuz to look at for example like our own parents which is our probably like our role models in this sense

620
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,180
I look at like our dad and I think my dad my dad right now has like his job is

621
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,380
Causes him a bunch of angst because he has to do a lot of shit for it

622
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,820
And he his happiest moments are on the weekends when he can go sailing and he really love

623
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,780
He really really loves sailing because he can just cut loose and do that shit and not be beholden to anybody

624
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,540
That's what he said is happiest and you know

625
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,980
It just makes you wonder if if he chose and not that he made any mistakes

626
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,780
But that if he chose the optimal way to live his life

627
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,660
Just because you know, I mean, I'm glad I exist because he married my mom that that worked out well for me

628
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:51,140
But perhaps it worked out better for him if you'd make a different path that let him pursue this kind of pleasurable activities more

629
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,460
You know if having a normal job had any merit at all then why do normies take vacations?

630
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,260
You know, I'm gonna counter-argument that a little bit. I think

631
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,500
Okay, I think that happiness

632
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,660
Not straight

633
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,140
Happiness happiness kind of balances itself out right like like the more miserable your job makes you yeah

634
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:34,380
Like the happier you are in comparison to it when you can get on the weekend and do what you want to do to a certain point

635
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:40,460
Yeah, I think that in the long run that kind of like net happiness tends to balance out for people

636
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,340
You know, that's true because humans aren't built to be happy all the time

637
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,940
It doesn't work out when you're given everything like like it would if you think if you think like if if dad's job was to be

638
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,660
I don't know a professional sailor whatever that would even mean right

639
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,560
He would be just static all the time while doing it. Absolutely. No, right. You're you that's so you're entirely right

640
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,060
You're entirely right about that. I don't know

641
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:05,780
I mean is the optimal life for like everyone to be an artist doing whatever they want like if we were living in

642
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,500
Star Trek and like everyone had everything they need like what would everybody do to obtain like their perfect life?

643
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,580
Would they all just like pursue their artistic endeavors or would they just like play video games?

644
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,180
I would do exactly what I'm doing me too

645
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,220
And I think that's the mark of of like that you're on the right path that that's the case for you

646
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:29,860
And I think most of us here, which I think is what unites us is that we agree that we are doing that in one way or another

647
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,680
Which means that all six of us are the normies and everyone else to get on our level

648
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,340
Everyone else is a failure and a weirdo you need to be like us

649
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:46,220
The real question is there's seven of us, so we're the main six plus spike. Which of us is the spike not it not it not it

650
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,420
It's digi digi's not here. It's digi

651
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,300
Digi's off eating ass like spike would be like spike it loves to do

652
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,940
admittedly, okay, so

653
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,020
Do we feel like we've covered this topic in general because before we leave I have one final challenge for us

654
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,700
Let's well should we wait I want us to wait for digi to get back

655
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,060
I don't think he's coming back anytime soon. Okay, let's hear it if he comes back in the middle of it fine

656
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,260
But before we finish this podcast

657
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:22,140
I really think we should all rank ourselves in terms of who's the most to least agreed agreed

658
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,140
I think and I'm gonna vote that

659
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,940
I'm gonna vote guy for no

660
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,940
Because you have a fucking job

661
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:38,020
Okay, all right, I don't mean to be critical, but I think Tommy might be a little more normie than me

662
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,260
I don't think so. I don't think so. That's not that's not an insult. I'm just like for example. He has a girlfriend

663
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:48,700
That's pretty normie. He went to visitor for a while, you know having a girlfriend is pretty fucking

664
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,940
That's right. That's right

665
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,340
I mean I sit here raging all the time that I don't have a girlfriend right now

666
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,500
So say that again. My girlfriend is like a continent away right now

667
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,500
But you have but you have one

668
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,260
I mean, it's pretty normie to to establish a kind of relationship that you would be willing to maintain over a long distance, you know

669
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,580
Well, I've got like some I think there's some merit to what you say guy

670
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
Thank you, but I'm still gonna give you

671
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,460
I mean if that's how the consensus will vote then I'll accept it

672
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,180
I do have a nine-to-five job that I work every single week

673
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Making each other's norminess

674
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,100
We're gonna rank ourselves. We're gonna rank the whole portion

675
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:32,780
I'll just give you mine right now. I guess if that's what it's gonna be. It's gonna be me then I'd say Tom then

676
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,620
Hippocrates cuz he's going to school then maybe then maybe

677
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,820
DeVoo then digi then

678
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,180
Jesse oh no, I forgot Ben Ben's in there somewhere

679
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,620
Jesse's the least normie though is the I

680
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,420
Well, we're talking like lifestyle here

681
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,260
I think I think he is probably

682
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,980
Second least normie second least you think hmm. Yeah, I think so

683
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,460
Possibly I put you up there though pretty high

684
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:11,020
Well, I take being at last as as the greatest compliment of all but did you just you're the only one who aspires to be normie more than any of us

685
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,260
You know, I'm a complicated guy. I'm a complicated. I'm a man of many contradictions

686
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,060
Just like to say that for the past

687
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:23,740
I don't know how long we've been doing this like 40 minutes. Yeah, but I've been in a quarter

688
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,220
I've been twisting the ends of my hair into hook shapes

689
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,060
And trying and using those hooks to try and pick my glasses off

690
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Well

691
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:48,340
Okay, that might be like the nail in the coffin of me ever being considered normie anyways

692
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,500
But this is this is about you beating up children again. It's gonna be the one where you peed on that girl

693
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,500
Okay, well those are two good ones. Yeah

694
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,240
Go on this is an example of how like normie us can come down to perspective

695
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,100
Because you can look at this story one way and it seems like I'm a cool guy who's got it all together

696
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,300
But then you look at it from the truth

697
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
I

698
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:22,580
Was that a Cody LaRue Halloween party three years ago. That's a five-star event. Yeah, so so basically

699
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,020
The normie account of what happened

700
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:32,020
Is that I went to a party and I hooked up with a girl who I had never even met before

701
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Normie

702
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,180
But what really happened is that I ended up rape he raped her

703
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:48,280
Very not normie well done. No, I want to hear the truth. I think pedophiles and war mainstreamed and youtubers

704
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:57,380
Well, what really happened is that I set is that I was getting a blowjob from a very obese woman

705
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,700
in an alleyway in Flint, Michigan nice and

706
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,540
You say it like that

707
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,420
Did that really happen? Yes, he bet your ass it happened

708
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:16,420
Well, like so like so many of my stories that I think like could almost pass for normie and then I remember like where I live

709
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,660
Yeah, that's true

710
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:26,620
Yeah, that's not a fact. We haven't considered his geography here. Yeah, I I always think that like from my perspective

711
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:35,140
By the way, who always seems less normal just because he's from the Midwest and like all of his Midwestern isms are inherently very strange to me

712
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,580
Yeah, I'm a middlest of the Midwest. I'm in the Kansas I'm so proud of the fact

713
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:46,700
I'm so proud of the fact that a city where I hang out all the time is now in the news and widely

714
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,260
Regarded as not the shithole of America. Yeah. Yeah

715
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:57,500
It feels me with the bizarre sense of pride and tranquility. It's that's a very non normie thing to be the worst place in America

716
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
You know, that's well done

717
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,180
I

718
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,940
Got to give you props for that

719
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,260
Just the fact that I hooked up with a fat chick in my car and you know, you know

720
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,740
I'm like the worst city in America

721
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:17,700
I I hooked up with a sort of fat Asian girl one time, but not you know, she wasn't full fat, which is great shame

722
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,700
No, no

723
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,440
The Lord of fives so perhaps wait the Lord of fives

724
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,600
Toby Toby and John both both have described you as the no the king of five. I can't wait. Yeah

725
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,880
Um, um guy, have you seen Toby's girlfriend? But he likes fat girls. He's into fat girls. So to him to him

726
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,320
That's yeah, so to him. So to him the skinny girls that I was hooking up with were only five

727
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:50,540
Oh, you're right. That was Toby who told me that maybe all along. He was leading me. Okay, I need to reevaluate the whole more like king of king

728
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:57,780
More like ends more like king of the nines as in that thing that black people do where they insult each other creatively back and forth

729
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,180
They call that a nine. Yeah, the nine you play in that's what Hitler played when he burned all the Jews

730
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:09,400
He was like nine. It was like nine. Hilarious. Get it guys. Very good joke night. Very good. Thank you. Let's wrap this up. Goodbye

731
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,980
Wait, wait, wait. No guys. Where do I fall? Where do I fall on the normie scale?

732
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,220
Then I think you're right about the fucking abnormal. I think you're very non normally

733
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:24,340
I think it depends on like again, which which normie or not normie things we're talking about, right?

734
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,620
Like is it more normie to live at home with your parents and just basically

735
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,840
Do whatever these days. That's very normie, right? Yeah

736
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,780
like Ben

737
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:41,820
If we're talking about like right now me and Ben might be like, you know, I don't know closer to toe and toe

738
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,260
Maybe I'm less normie than him

739
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,220
But if we're talking about the Ben that lived bummed around California for a year

740
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,220
Oh, I think that was a little bit

741
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,220
Yeah, that Ben like I could never do that

742
01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:00,940
I think Ben is one in non-norminess. I mean Jesse what we say I forgot to mention the best part of my story

743
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:07,860
Not only was I getting a blowjob from a fat disgusting pig girl that I've never met in a car in an alleyway in Flint, Michigan

744
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,580
But I was also dressed up as Winnie the Pooh

745
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,220
I

746
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,620
Did she pretend she was Christopher Robin? No, that would happen. I don't think she got the reference

747
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,380
Now that's normie behavior that we can all

748
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,140
He heard this but I'm positive

749
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,700
Knowing how drunk I was I'm positive that I did the voice at some point

750
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,500
No, I'm imagining him in a fursuit and like a Winnie the Pooh fucking

751
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
It's not a fursuit

752
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:25,660
Holy shit in reality Jesse's a Pooh bear costume was just the I'm a bear t-shirt

753
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,860
Or at the altered beast it was legit. I had I got a red shirt. I wrote Pooh on it

754
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:37,060
I fucking I had the ears. I had that's that basically all you need and my pants were off, too

755
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,060
So the costume was even more accurate

756
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:44,380
Really I had to go with that girl take my pants off in order for the costume to work

757
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:50,420
It was he who was loyal to the characters the last that's I like to think that's exactly what Winnie the Pooh would have done

758
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,540
he's

759
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,060
He's the least normie of us all we keep trying to rank ourselves based on our

760
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:02,540
On our lifestyles, but what about just our personalities like how we would

761
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:10,700
Difference like I don't know how I think we're all relatively similar. That's why we've all kind of

762
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,740
Yeah

763
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,180
That's how we all met yeah similar interests and similar like goals

764
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:22,380
I guess I mean what divu would you change the ranking in any significant way based on our personalities?

765
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,300
I don't know Jesse not still be the most

766
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
Abnormie

767
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,140
That's the word like I don't know like he's um

768
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,860
Like he has the weirdest things that he doesn't tell anyone about except on the internet

769
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:41,660
But in terms of just like a person out and you just see them and say hi

770
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,700
You know how weird would each of us right?

771
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:50,580
I mean our parents yell that through car windows with at an alarming rate when I go out

772
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:55,620
Which is why part of the reason I don't go out that's because of those those flint brains are added with all that lead

773
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,060
You know, who knows what's going on? I don't know man

774
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,580
I think I think the fact that I crave

775
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:08,580
Right now. I'm craving to hear how abnormie I am and I really think that speaks to the fact that being a non

776
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:12,420
Normie is like a pretty normie thing now. It is. It is. It's

777
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:18,180
Cool, it's edgy. I keep forgetting that my room flooded with poop poopy water and I fucking

778
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,660
I

779
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,660
Made a video

780
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,940
Instead of making steps to clean it

781
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,500
The first thing I did you know

782
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,940
I showed that video to a lot of people now and all of them would say the same thing

783
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,000
I can't believe he'd do his toys in there and I was like

784
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:40,100
Yeah, I tried to picture myself in the same scenario and I think I definitely would have thrown my toys in there

785
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,700
Like I don't think I would have had much hesitation in doing that

786
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,580
Unless it was like how I know I'm more normie because I would just be freaking out if my water was leaking

787
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,300
I mean, I would have freaked out considerably first and I'm sure Jesse has in the past

788
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,860
But he's just he wakes up one day sees it. There's poop water his house is like, all right

789
01:04:55,860 --> 01:05:00,160
I honestly don't freak out because stuff like that happens to me so often

790
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,980
Yeah, I've acquired a zenness about it. I can definitely talk about his room flooding for years

791
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:11,780
So I can definitely see digi without the aid of even making a video just deciding cuz he's drunk

792
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:19,340
I have too much self-restraint

793
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
Oh, we were talking about this on a digi bros the other day

794
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,660
How like I used to get like I would get really mad and I'd like want to thrash my room

795
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,940
But then I would look at all the stuff in my room and think about how expensive it all is

796
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:35,380
And I would just push over a fan like I've done I have literally dropped kicked a fan several times

797
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,880
Just because it was the only thing that wouldn't break if I attacked it

798
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:45,160
Oh, the closest I've ever come to like real damage was after watching Bojack Horseman

799
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,000
Because I spent the entire time I was watching it getting drunk

800
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,040
Like I didn't stop drinking wine the whole time

801
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,520
I was watching the show and I was like oh like unbelievably beyond wasted by the end of it

802
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:01,840
and then I put on death grips and I went into my fucking bathroom the first song on on the new out on their latest album was

803
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,400
I break mirrors at my face in the United States and I'm like screaming it into the mirror at myself

804
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,320
And I'm just thinking like I got to do it

805
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,480
I got to break this mirror with my face in the United States

806
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,200
I have to and like I'm like leaning over the over the sink like and I'm thinking about it and I'm like

807
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:21,640
Do I because I my justification in my mind was I make enough money now that I can replace this mirror

808
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,840
So I was like I could do it. I could break this mirror with my face

809
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,040
I can replace you like Charles Foster Kane just trashing his own room because he has all the money

810
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,560
But then the conclusion or Tommy was Tommy was about to kill himself

811
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,200
But I was just staring at the mirror and then I thought about it and I was like all right first of all

812
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,240
I don't know how badly I'm gonna cut myself up doing this

813
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,600
Maybe I'll end up in the hospital and I don't want to pay those bills and then I thought about it

814
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,840
And I was like I don't know how much these mirrors actually cost. What if this is a $200 mirror

815
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't want to spend that because I just wanted to break something with my face

816
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,880
So in spite of how being outrageously drunk and really wanting to break that mirror

817
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
I ended up not doing it and

818
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,400
Going back to throw over my desk chair because it you know wouldn't break

819
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,040
The best thing that I ever did was I punched my laptop in the screen and shattered it

820
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,360
because

821
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,360
It was pretty sweet

822
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:16,920
But it was pretty normie honestly because it was because I was like having a fight with my college girlfriend

823
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,040
You know because I was home for vacation and like we got mad at each other and I was so upset that I broke my laptop

824
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
Yeah, but

825
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,080
Walls where my dad had like gotten mad in a fight and just like punched holes through the wall like

826
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,480
Ben's done that Ben's the hole in the wall. I did I did kick a hole through our basement wall

827
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,240
Oh, it's my friend John who punched a hole in the wall. Yeah, okay different. Yeah, I kicked I kicked our wall in

828
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Just a little bit

829
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:51,520
Because my friend who is a violent maniac who if we if he was here I do have one friend who might be less normie than me

830
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,280
In the sense that he is absolutely violently insane

831
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,320
And we'll like fight people for no reason and that kind of thing

832
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,520
That's like the clinical kind of non-norminess. Yeah

833
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,840
Yeah, there's so there's so many

834
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:10,360
Absorb his abnorminess. It's like jet me in the one. That's how it works. That's right

835
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,200
There's so many different axes upon which can be one can be normie or non-normie

836
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,680
Anime of all-time dimension w in which there are several axes in which

837
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,920
It's a big fan of yours too. What's that did you the friend of mine who's like super crazy

838
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,360
He's a big yeah, yes, he as well

839
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:38,040
But yeah, he put a hole in my uh in my in my bathroom door just by because he opened it with his elbow one time

840
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,080
Like just like slammed it with his elbow and broke it and I was like you're too strong

841
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,240
Because he's like a huge monster man like a giant fucking

842
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,080
Yeah, he's a Hulk dude

843
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,920
Is he one of these actually strong guys or did he no he worked out

844
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,240
He was like he was like a skinny little twink in high school

845
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,300
And then he like beefed the fuck up and became a monster. That's my now

846
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:05,760
He's like a psycho like vegan crazy man. Oh vegan too impressive. Okay. What the hell is this podcast about?

847
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
It's about fuck you

848
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,560
Hippo I was I was waiting for a chance for like a pause in the conversation to be like well

849
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,160
I think we've really said a lot on the subject of

850
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Like

851
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,280
General I mean I

852
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,000
Think we've gotten the surprising like we've made it less cringy than it first seemed like it was I don't think it's

853
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,300
I just think it's silly because like we have that

854
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:40,080
Google doc of all the potential topics and like some of them are like actual topics and then in the middle of it

855
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,680
It just says fucking normies

856
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:51,840
I mean I mean I think we occasionally touched on some somewhat relevant subject matter

857
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:56,520
But for the most part we came to no conclusions. We don't understand

858
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
I

859
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,800
Stay together and find a place worth fighting for

860
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,720
I'm on the road

861
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
to normie city
