1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Well boys, you're rich, you love, you're in love. Top it off, you got your own monkey.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,280
Work of two guys from Jersey, possibly one. Well to have these fucks stop talking shit

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,520
about us on the internet for starters. What have I been telling you? There's not much

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,440
you can do to stop that. Well short of showing up at all their houses beating the shit out

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:38,880
of them I guess. You know with all the money we're making man we could buy a lot of plane

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
tickets.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,840
Commenters please kill yourselves and free me from this living hell. If your comment is

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,560
mean and snythen you can just fuck off and die. Why do you feel entitled to spewing your

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,760
bullshit attitude? You're rude and crude and I hate you so kill yourselves please and

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:07,400
be cool. I pronounce the word wrong I don't care. I didn't represent you, yeah no shit

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,840
I am myself motherfucker. Think I got a bad attitude while you ain't seen shit. A shadow

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,800
band you're ass to deal with it. Hello everybody and welcome to yet another episode of the Pro

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Crastinators podcast. I'm hosting today, I'm Digi Bro and we're doing a little sequel

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,360
to a topic we've done before. We did reviewer rules, now we're doing commenter rules and

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm joined by my panel of co-hosts, starting left to right. We got Jesse Wood. Happy Easter

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,920
I'm gonna shit on everyone. Endless, endless Jess, not as Jesse Wood. Oh I'm gonna get

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:55,680
into that. Yeah that's gonna be important. Best guy ever? Hey sexy lady. The DeVoo?

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:11,800
www.hi.com. Hippocrit. Yep. And Tommy Oliver. I'm mad at comments. Yes, yeah. The recent

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,960
example of a toxic comment section. Toxic. This is a very appropriate time for us to

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,640
do this podcast. This is something that has been brewing within me for a long time. Let

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,520
me tell you guys, I've been like a caged animal waiting for this topic to come up. I have

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,520
so much to fucking say. The people have asked for it too. The commenters want to know how

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,120
to conduct themselves. They're just ignorant and they need education. If only it was that

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,360
cut and dry. Yeah when we did reviewer rules we sort of hinted at doing commenter rules

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,480
and I've had this video idea planned for a long time. I was gonna do like a top 10 video,

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,360
top 10 things to make me hate you in my comment section. I've been planning that forever. I

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,800
feel like you should still do that. Definitely. Yeah but I have multiple comment videos written

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,120
that I'm just sitting on waiting to unleash upon the world. I mean if you put the money

29
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,360
just gonna get the comments. Hopefully this opens the fucking. This just goes to show how

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,640
passionate we are about this topic. It had to be done on this podcast for a few reasons.

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,520
One cause Jesse always has problems with this commenters. He's been on like a fucking

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:24,640
crusade. I've developed a system. It's a three step system where if you even fucking piss

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,120
me off one time. Like I've been doing this for like six years. I've fucking had it.

34
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,920
So from now on, if you even slightly piss me off, the first thing I do is right away

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,480
you're banned. You can never fucking comment again. I don't give a shit what your excuse is. If you

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,440
say you were ignorant of the rules or if you didn't mean to offend me, fuck you, you're gone. And the

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
best part is it's a shadow ban. So you don't even fucking know your ban. You're just writing your

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,120
comments out and they go into a void. It's a Chinese ban. Yeah so step one is your ban. Step

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
two, I screencap your comment and I ridicule you publicly on Twitter so that everyone knows what a

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
piece of shit you are for all time. And the third step. It helps filter out more comments because

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,920
a lot of Twitter people will then be like, I think that guy has a decent point so that you can

42
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,640
ban him. Exactly. That's my plan. It'll help foster a better comment section in the future.

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,840
It's very clear right now. People who are going to say that you're violating your freedom of

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,640
speech, I have it right here. The first amendment. This is what it says. The first amendment is

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,400
don't piss me off. I'll fucking kill you. Don't say anything on my fucking shit. Don't say anything

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
on the internet. You wouldn't say it on my face. Jesse, what's step three? What's step three?

47
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,640
Is that since I have a screencap of your comment, it goes, it gets filed away in a

48
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,200
manila folder for future use in a fucking video where I will even more publicly fucking shame you

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,400
and make you, hopefully you'll be watching and make you kill yourself. That's my ultimate goal,

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
is to make my commenters. It kills themselves in shame. It's funny because we're kind of

51
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,160
slipped down the middle on our handling of comments. I don't respect their right to live as a human

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
being on this world. They are holding all of humanity back with their bullshit insipid comments

53
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,000
and their refusal to understand anything. They're getting ahead of ourselves. It's funny. I want to

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,680
murder them with a shotgun. I have murderous fantasies. I want to find them. I want to get on

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,600
a plane and go to all. It fucking bothers me. It keeps me up at night. It makes my skin crawl to

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,640
think that I can't fight my commenters. I want to get on a plane like Jay and Son of Bob strike back

57
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,800
and fly all over America and find them and one by one kick the crap out of their pubis fucking heads.

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,680
That should be the intro to this video. Actually, yeah, it should be because that scene is amazing.

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
It really is. I think that's probably the most, I think for an internet content creator, if you

60
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,920
haven't seen this, you can just watch Jesse did a video where he set that scene to the Kill La Kill

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,880
song. You can just go watch that. It's one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen. It is one

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,880
of my favorite scenes in any movie. It's literally Jay and Silent Bob get rich and with all the money

63
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,440
they have, they realize that they can fly around the U.S. and beat the shit out of people who leave

64
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,080
negative comments on their online content. I've gone through a period where I've had a big video

65
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,680
that gets lots of bad comments. What I was just thinking of is I can just mail them all a ticket

66
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,480
to this exotic trip on a bus and then drive the bus into a careen and kill all of them in one fell

67
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,840
swoop. That seems a lot easier to get away with because they'll just be seen as a coincidence.

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,800
The only problem is they're not all going to fit on one bus. There's just too many.

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
You know what? Maybe we're right to intro this way just so people can understand the level

70
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,000
of passion. Because we all have different ways of dealing with comments, but our hatred for bad

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
comments is universal and seething. That's true. I think we'll all agree on this one. I hate this.

72
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,440
I know that at least Digi agrees. I hate this stigma of against turning off the comment section.

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,760
The only reason I don't turn mine off is because there's a stigma against it.

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,240
I don't believe that comments should even be allowed anywhere at all. They shouldn't exist.

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Well, Jesse, you keep getting ahead of me here, man. We're already six minutes in

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
and I haven't even properly introduced this topic. I told you when we were starting this

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,200
that I have a lot to say about this topic. I know we're going to get to that. We're going to get

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,400
to it. Just let me properly lead us in first. Okay, go for it. Because the part of the reason

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,360
for this is not just that Jesse has this ongoing crusade. It just so happens that

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,680
me and Tom have both recently have really bad comment sections. I made this video about a race

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,560
that got over 3,000 comments in 24 hours, which is way disproportional to the number of views

82
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,840
it has. It's like everyone who watched it fucking commented. I've had to ban more people based on

83
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,760
this video than I have based on any other video for the insipidness of the comments.

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,720
Even more than the sort of online? Well, with that one, I just turned off the whole comment

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,840
section. And I didn't really ban people back then as much as I do now. And then Tommy Oliver here

86
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,120
recently put out this pony video, which is funny because it was in response to comments he'd gotten

87
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
in the past. Tom, you want to explain this? What exactly this is? Yeah, I mean, for the past three

88
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,600
years, I made horse videos years ago. I don't even really do it anymore. To this day, I still get

89
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,360
comments like shitting on this one stupid idea that I had. And so they finally, after years of

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,800
persecution, the show basically up and says I was right. So I make this most like tongue in cheek

91
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,440
disgusting meme trash video just gloating because like I'm right and it felt great. So I put like

92
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,720
70 comments in the video that I'll just like try to shit on me over the course of like three years

93
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
and then just like blew it the fuck up. I've never so thoroughly seen one group of commenters get

94
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,400
absolutely ass blasted the fuck out like it was on that video. It was amazing. It was great. I

95
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
want you to go watch it. It was years in the making. But of course it just inspired like it's

96
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,800
because we took all this time. Me and Nate went back for them. We got to make sure this is airtight

97
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,600
and bulletproof and it doesn't matter. You know, stupidity knows no bounds. You can't expect them

98
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
to learn like people. They're not people. They're monkeys. They're animals. I mean, if you look,

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,040
if you have a conclusion and you're searching for evidence to find it like, okay, my point is

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,520
Tom's wrong. Got to find evidence. You'll always be able to find confirmation. Little minutia, huge

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,800
problem voted up. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. So, yeah, Jesse, to get back to it,

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,240
the point you were bringing up and I have like a 30 minute video about this on my Digibro After Dark

103
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,360
channel called On Closing Comments. We won't get into as much depth about it because you can just

104
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,600
go watch that video. But like, yeah, there is a huge weird stigma against closing comments that

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,920
makes no fucking sense. And the simplest way to explain why it doesn't make sense is that

106
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,840
no other art form has this. Yeah. When I go and see a movie in the theater,

107
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,600
they don't give you a pamphlet with a bunch of rotten tomatoes reviews inside of it when you go

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
see a movie. No. There's no, there's no other art form that has the comments, except for like,

109
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,360
like with a book, they will actually take good comments people have made about it and put it

110
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,880
in the book to hype up the book. That's the closest thing I could think of to this. But like,

111
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,400
people think that they're entitled to, like, and it's always censorship and freedom of speech is

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,240
what they always say. They always say, oh, it's censorship to delete comments. And it's like,

113
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,040
no, it's not because I am giving you this platform. I don't have to. There is no, like,

114
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,800
when people say it's censorship, it's like censorship would be if I told you that,

115
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,920
like, if I shut down your blog that was talking about my video. What is it? I'm kind of on the

116
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,080
other side of this argument because I see a comment section as a place where there is an

117
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,840
opportunity for discussion. And yes, some comment sections are completely cancer.

118
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Yeah, but you, you allow that. Because that's right. I do.

119
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,520
YouTube has a button that you can press that says allow comments on this video or don't allow

120
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,840
comments on this video. If I want discussion on my video, I leave the, like 100% of the reason

121
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,720
there's comments on my videos is that I like reading comments because I have fostered a

122
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,120
comment section that actually has good discussions. Sometimes, sometimes it's shit, which is why,

123
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,280
like, the other day I made a video about positive videos I had done. It was like,

124
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,160
videos about anime I actually like. And the whole video is just me listing all the positive videos

125
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,120
I've done. And at the start of it, I made the horrible mistake of saying comments about my beard

126
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
will be deleted. Because every time I show my face on camera, I get a thousand comments about my

127
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
beard. And it's super annoying because there's nothing to do with the video. And I don't want

128
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,880
to hear about my fucking beard. So I said that and of course I got like an insane number of

129
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,040
comments about the beard and I was deleting them all. And then I realized that the other

130
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,880
comments weren't interesting because there was nothing to discuss in this video. It was just

131
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,160
a list of other videos. So I just disabled comments on the whole video and that made perfect sense

132
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,480
because there's no room for discussion. There's nothing to talk about on it. So like,

133
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,360
the comments section to me is really just your way of saying, hey, I want you guys to talk about

134
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,280
my video and I want to read it. In a perfect world, it would be a place for discussion,

135
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,840
but that's just not the reality of how it is because people are violent mutants and it's just

136
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,960
sewage. It's graffiti is what it is. It's not graffiti because in no way does it actually

137
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,920
impact the material itself. Because if somebody leaves a comment that completely misunderstands

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
my intent and they leave that fucking comment on there, other people see it and it affects how

139
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,880
people view my art. Okay, let's make a distinction between closing comments and deleting bad comments

140
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,240
that are purely tacky. It's just a fucking blight on my work, on my blood sweat and tear. I honestly

141
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,640
thank you guys for a little bit too sensitive about the criticisms you get. This is not just

142
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,120
about criticisms. How many times have you seen a comment that spoiled what was going to happen

143
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,280
in the video, that repeated the jokes from the video and therefore if you read, because a lot

144
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,320
of people, because of the fact that the comments are right there, a lot of people do end up scrolling

145
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,080
down and looking at the first few comments while they're watching the video and those first few

146
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,400
comments will almost always be some kind of spoiler, some kind of repeat of the joke that was in the

147
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,320
video. Are spoilers, are those really relevant though? Do those really cost you anything in the

148
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,760
video? I don't know if they do. How many videos are like ruined by spoilers on YouTube? There

149
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,960
could be a lot because if you ruin the punchline of a joke video, then the punchline is the same.

150
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,640
You don't know the meaning of the punchline, so there's nothing to spoil until you already get

151
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,520
to that point. You would be shocked by how often there are spoilers in the comments of YouTube

152
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,760
videos. The comments down there are part of the viewing experience. I could be watching someone's

153
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
video and like it, then I read a comment, it puts me in a bad mood, and so the commenters just spoiled

154
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,280
the good mood that the video put me in. Those dang commenters. Friends, then don't read the comments.

155
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,240
That's on YouTube. Just don't read the comments. It's very hard to not read comments there right

156
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,280
there. If the comments aren't supposed to be read, they should be elsewhere. This podcast is not

157
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,200
titled Let's Remove All Comments. It's called Comment to Rules because we want comments to be

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,000
good because that won't happen. And a part of that is the creator's ability to remove comments or

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
allow them. Given you were saying something, what are you saying? I was going to say I think a lot

160
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,440
of the people who comment like just incipid uninteresting stuff is because they use the

161
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,080
comment section like they would a Skype chat. Like they don't have anyone to talk to the video

162
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,960
about, so they feel like it's a community down there. That's true. They can look at it. I think

163
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,120
that's a valuable thing when I wouldn't really want to take it away from people. Well, Nate,

164
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,560
that's a thing though. It can be valuable and it can also be hurtful. It can actually make,

165
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,280
like okay, for something like- It could be. My Digi Bros show, right? My Digi Bros show,

166
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,840
the comment section is really good because it does feel like a community because it's a small

167
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,920
group of people watching it. It's the same people watching every video. So there's sort of a communication

168
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,880
between them and us. We read the comments and there's an ongoing conversation. And I like that

169
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,680
because it's an ongoing series of videos, because it's something that has a narrative to it and

170
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
that the commenters understand that narrative, and there really is nowhere else to talk about it,

171
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,960
nowhere else that makes sense to talk about it. But if you had, let's say PewDiePie, right?

172
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,920
There's a reason that he doesn't have comments enabled on his videos, partly because he gets

173
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,320
constant spam in there, but also because to foster that kind of community, he has his own

174
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
forum. There's a whole PewDiePie forum where people can actually discuss his videos who

175
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,680
all sort of know the context, who know all the things he's talking about, and aren't just random

176
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,600
people running in and yelling memes and being... Look, that's true. There's no place I've seen

177
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
that was more gross than the PewDiePie comment section, especially with spam. But I just wonder

178
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,880
if there's really any harm being done by filling the comment section with those when you just have

179
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,120
the ability to not look at it. You can just not scroll down because you're on a PewDiePie video

180
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:53,360
and you know that it's going to be... It's pretty good analogy for comment sections that I just thought

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,720
It's kind of like the YouTube video is like a party that's being thrown by the YouTuber

182
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
and all the people who come in like it's a free party and there's free food and stuff and they

183
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,440
come and they experience it and anything they say out loud within a shot of like the guy who's

184
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,840
hosting it is a comment and anything they say to their friends after they leave or anything is

185
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,000
like something they say amongst themselves or in their own Skype chats or somewhere else

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,520
where it doesn't hurt it's not annoying but if you if somebody just comes in and they you know

187
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,760
they try the punch and they don't like it and they say this party sucks really loud and there's

188
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,520
leave like that's a bad comment I hate that guy because you just first of all I don't feel like

189
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,720
it's a party I feel like like my videos are are are for me and my friends and to a much

190
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
lesser extent but still they're you know my patrons and that's it everyone else is an

191
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,040
uninvited guest in my house so you better fucking behave yourselves and if you don't

192
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,080
you're dead I will stick my dogs on you I don't begrudge anyone for closing their comments if they

193
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,760
want to you absolutely have the right to do that I'm just simply stating why I'm not interested

194
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,880
in doing that personally or I mean maybe I'll get a video uh that has a completely toxic comment

195
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,960
section you already have one what about your Final Fantasy 7 video those but that's the thing

196
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:13,280
that is that is definitely a toxic place where people don't fucking understand anything I mean

197
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,600
the half the people who watch it voted down they don't understand my points and it's it's simply

198
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,400
them you know being ignorant of the facts but even then even then I like to think that it is

199
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
it's something that could be witnessed by people who do get it they could be like wow

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,760
there's something to be learned from this kind of comment section you know right so first of all

201
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,160
everyone listening I'm not bad at interrupting I just rolled a bunch of bad

202
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,920
rolls a bunch of times in a row that's why I was so bad interrupting for seven minutes there

203
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm a good interrupter second of all all right uh commenter rule number one wait let me interrupt

204
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
you real quick DeVoo uh I've got to say that I'm probably the best interrupter wait actually

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,000
did you just both of you did you just compare interrupting to like rolling a dnd type because

206
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,360
that's funny I like that that's a really good analogy I actually I don't know how I have to cut

207
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,800
off I have to cut off everybody because DeVoo I don't want you to say what your number one rule is

208
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,720
it could be rule number two because I already had planned what rule number one was yeah let's

209
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,360
get into the specific things so rule number two make friends on Skype and bitch about YouTube videos

210
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,600
there because we do that constantly we constantly make comments because we make videos and we know

211
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
how annoying they can be to read so we say a lot of shit in prayer even if you're just a big fan of

212
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,880
videos then you probably have a whole lot of bitchy thoughts you want to think about and something

213
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,800
makes you mad that's perfectly understandable so just hunt down people who watch the same kind of

214
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,400
videos complain with them and then everything is going good that's the natural order of things

215
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,880
let me tell you about a feature that I didn't appreciate back when I had it but now I really

216
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,400
miss it which is there used to be this thing called a google reader and it was an rss feed reader

217
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,880
where you'd have like you know all the basically any blog you follow you would plug its feed into

218
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,160
your google reader it's kind of like subscribing to something on youtube it would be a list of all

219
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,680
the blogs that you're following right and you could share like you could take something from that feed

220
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,960
and share it with your friends on google and then you could have your own comment section for that

221
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,480
post so let's say I posted something on my blog and then my blog has its own comment section where

222
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
people are responding to me but then if someone shared the thing on google reader then they could

223
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,760
just talk about it with their friends and it would give us the opportunity to speak more critically

224
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,120
about the post without having to say stuff right to the guy's face that maybe would be annoying or

225
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,800
you know or or beat defeat the point or derail the conversation so I think that that is definitely

226
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,520
something that should be done I think there's too many people who respond to your video with

227
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
comments that aren't helpful for you or for other viewers of the video they're just the guy I don't

228
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,840
know I think this whole I think this whole wall of separation you want to put up between the

229
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,160
person who made it and the people who are commenting on it I'm not sure that's a good thing that's not

230
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,280
that is not what I'm describing okay I'm describing having two places to discuss the video all right

231
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,040
one that you could like could you imagine if all of us took the shit that we say about like the

232
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,280
average like brony reviewer and we said all that in their comments it would be a nightmare it would

233
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,840
fucking ruin their life you know they would hate it they would fucking delete their channel and kill

234
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,160
themselves if they had us doing that because we have this chat we can openly criticize and discuss

235
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,480
people ah so you're saying there's a time and a place for certain comments and yeah I'm saying

236
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,920
that those comments would not be appropriate on the right I think the point is that being on the

237
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:31,120
internet and having a comment section isn't an excuse to ignore human decency yes like you should

238
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,560
as a proud fortune or I disagree for the same reasons that you wouldn't like like okay you know

239
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,000
I have all my friends right my my offline friends because we all talk together all the time I don't

240
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,720
think any of us really just like splits off into one-on-one groups and talks shit about each other

241
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,240
at least I don't as far as you know as far as you know but uh but like you know in real life I

242
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,880
talk to myself about how much I hate you all yeah you've got all your friends and you you split off

243
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,640
with one of them and you might talk shit about all the other friends yeah but it's not it's not

244
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,200
because you don't like them you just want to vent your feelings about them right and if you brought

245
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,160
those things up to that person they might be hurt or offended and it might you know put a damper on

246
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,320
your relationship in a way that you didn't intend to because you're just venting feelings that that

247
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,560
inside you can deal with because you want to be friends with that guy but you know maybe you

248
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,920
got to complain about that friendship and human decency is based on it's having respect for someone

249
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,960
to shit on them privately and you know the reason why that's part of human decency the YouTube sphere

250
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,080
is a place where you put ideas and then people shit on them because that's just the way they feel

251
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,600
like doing it but that's the thing I don't think it I don't think it makes sense to be that way

252
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,120
like like I said like I said there's no there's never a time like if we all watched Batman v

253
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,000
Superman yeah and we all thought it was a huge piece of shit no one walks up to Zach Snyder on

254
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,880
the street and goes your movie's a fucking piece of shit I might make internet videos we posted we

255
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,720
posted on our blogs for our audiences for us to discuss with our friends we don't go up to the

256
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,280
fucking guy and tell him he's a piece of shit but I mean isn't that possibly worse that you're

257
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
like creating you're you're sharing this opinion with all these people I mean they they probably

258
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
haven't formed an opinion yet I mean if you're doing that aren't you convincing these people to

259
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,000
maybe be that guy and to you know engage in that I'm convincing them to feel the way I feel but

260
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,960
not to confront Zach Snyder himself obviously yeah not to go up to the guy and tell him he's a bad

261
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
person because he made a movie I kind of I don't know like doesn't he need to hear that like dude

262
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,720
your movie fucking sucked do a better job not necessarily because he's just doing what he I

263
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,800
don't know how we don't know movies do we have to get before they hear some real criticism about

264
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,040
how fucked up I mean sure if I mean from the perspective of like business yeah like if if

265
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,920
the people who are paying him are listening to the commenters because they care about making good

266
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,360
movies then it's up to them to tell him hey we don't like what you're doing and we we're not

267
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,040
going to let you have this budget but Zach Snyder himself we don't know what his intentions are

268
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,120
maybe he doesn't give a fuck about making good movies he's just doing what he feels like doing

269
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,600
and that's completely fine that's not fine that's not fine that we have to be subjected to shit

270
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,320
art and then he's not no one's allowed to criticize under his face I mean it's not really his like

271
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
okay who's giving him the power to make Batman v Superman look we have to blame someone for the

272
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,960
result of a bad okay well also who are we to say that it's shit art in the first place it's true

273
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,320
I thought that I thought that Batman v Superman was laughably hilariously a fucking train wreck

274
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,880
like on the level of the room and I thought for sure that this would be the unanimous opinion

275
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,800
that everyone would agree with me that it was a fucking train wreck of a movie and then I talked

276
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
to a fucking gargag on Facebook and and he's like that was the best movie ever anyone who complains

277
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,400
about it is a nitpicking faggot so then I have to step back and go oh well maybe I am a nitpicking

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,400
faggot I don't fucking know shit okay we can't get into a whole discussion about the subjectivity

279
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
of art because that's a whole different thing once you come to a conclusion about something

280
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,000
well I'm back in the digits point like I wouldn't go up to Zach Snyder and say fuck you your movie

281
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,080
sucks right I had I had a comment on on my reddit the other day because I have my own reddit board

282
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,400
and people will often post my videos on there and like you know have more private discussions about

283
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,840
them like with me because I'm more likely to read and respond to longer comments on there and one

284
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,120
guy left a long comment about my erased video basically saying that it wasn't that helpful for

285
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,000
for like essentially he was saying that it didn't represent a broad opinion or it didn't represent

286
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,520
like you know his like how most people felt about the show and stuff like that why does that

287
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,000
simply already worth this point it needs to yeah exactly right but that's that's that's kind of what

288
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,360
I what I said in response is I was like I mean I get I completely understood his complaints and I was

289
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,040
just like this video is really for me though it's not really about like it's not like this was not

290
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,800
supposed to be helpful for everybody it was supposed to help for a very certain as I'm listening to

291
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,200
this conversation I'm trying to imagine what a commenter person listening to this podcast is

292
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
thinking and I'm thinking that they're thinking yo I wasn't trying to be insulting I didn't call

293
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,040
them a faggot I didn't call them any names all I did was point out some mistakes that they made

294
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,520
in their video and then they flipped on me because they were wrong overreacting so here's here's my

295
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,920
parameters right here are my three conditions for I I think you guys would agree but here are my

296
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,200
conditions for like a criticism in any capacity that I would respect or like versus ones I don't

297
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,080
first parameter is do you know what you're talking about do you really put in the thinking did you

298
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,240
put in the thought did you did you apply critical thinking right to okay are you are you do you have

299
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,440
tacked are you acting like a normal person are you not being an asshole parameter number three

300
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,600
is your criticism effort did was there much effort into it was it a piece of art was your

301
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,480
criticism a work of its own or was it just two sentences of a complaint because that's kind of

302
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,240
annoying I don't think there's anything wrong with a simple complaint that gets to the point okay you

303
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,920
don't need to have all three conditions right but okay because I think people are gonna say that

304
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,240
we're being hypocritical because of the fact let me try to boil that down a little bit because I

305
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,040
think what you're getting to the heart of here is people who say that uh that you can't take criticism

306
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,880
right right I gotta say it's the longer I hold on to my thoughts the more nervous I get for some

307
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,800
reason if I take too long to say my things I freak out and I expect did anybody miss me fuck down

308
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,560
hey give yeah you know like a comment like that video sucks I think a lot of people are gonna say

309
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,120
you're guys being hypocritical because you guys make criticisms like I don't think right here's

310
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,160
here's my here's my response to that all right because people say people say like you know you

311
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,160
can't take criticism when you when you delete their critical comments and I have to get to

312
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,560
the heart of what I think right that's an over simplification and what I think we are doing

313
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,600
because like like me and Jesse said we don't post these to the guys who make the stuff we're talking

314
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,440
about yeah we just post these opinions online which is our reactions to the things that we see

315
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
that are entirely about us like there's a reason my channel is called otaku gonzo journalism because

316
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,960
it's about me it's about my perspective I don't send my sao videos to reki kawahara and tell

317
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,520
him he's doing a bad job and the reason that I don't is because to me constructive criticism

318
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,400
has to be from the perspective of understanding what the artist was trying to do because it's not

319
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,760
constructive if you don't know what I was going for like that erased guy who was saying that his

320
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,480
problem with the video was that I didn't you know appeal to a broader audience and he was saying this

321
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,640
is a problem with your video and I'm like but that wasn't my goal with the video my goal was to appeal

322
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,080
to this specific type of person and to myself the fact that everybody got to see the video is just

323
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
because that's the platform by which it will reach the people it has to reach I don't know I can't

324
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,080
like go out and find each individual who felt a certain way about a race and just but that's just

325
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,960
something that you accept by using this medium of YouTube you know it's but the fact that that guy's

326
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,800
comment isn't his it's not a point he's making somewhere else he's making it directly to me

327
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,160
and just to tell me hey you did it wrong now hang on I think it's like well I didn't I didn't intend

328
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,280
to do what you think I intended I think he's making it that comment to the other viewers of the video

329
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,960
you know because he posted it on my reddit oh okay so it's like straight like I'm the only one who I

330
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,640
think you know I I realized that I feel this way wrong criticism is worse to me than just insulting

331
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:20,240
me for no reason because when you fucking lobby some criticism at my art that is fundamentally

332
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,440
based on a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of my intent and you throw that criticism out

333
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,920
there as though it's valid other people are going to see it and think that it's valid and they're

334
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,120
going to view my shit through that lens but but sometimes sometimes and it's gonna sound crazy

335
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,040
but sometimes they're right no they're fucking not no I know that because if it wasn't perfect I

336
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,680
wouldn't have fucking uploaded it I know what I'm fucking created and I know what my intent is and

337
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,560
they don't I'm endless Jess and you're not all of you are not all of you listening to this

338
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,720
fucking podcast please fucking kill yourselves I agree but I don't think that the creator should

339
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,600
be the end all be all sayer of what is correct what is wrong about the video I absolutely want people

340
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,560
to be able to judge that themselves well here's what if you have people misunderstanding your videos

341
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:15,520
is that a failing on the audience is that a failing on you people misunderstanding my video

342
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,720
fine but you know what pisses me off me calmly explaining what they misunderstood and ignoring

343
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,800
nice wording and then I either get no reply or they continue to double down on you know what I

344
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,560
would like I would like an oh okay I would like people to exercise just a little bit of humility

345
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,760
you know yeah well I would turn that right back maybe you're wrong about your point you know the

346
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,440
lack of humility when people are not just like wrong or like not just misinterpreting the video

347
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,400
or misinterpreting something you did but like stubbornly wrong like you respond to them they'll

348
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,880
say well this this is this video sucks and you suck because this reason this reason and then and

349
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,680
then you go well actually it yeah actually what I was trying to do was this and then they still stick

350
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,160
to it like no no no no no you're right because yeah because of what I guess and it's like I just told

351
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:07,040
you that wasn't my intent you little fucking slimy protozoa you don't deserve dude all right all right

352
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,880
I hear what you're saying let me read you something because okay I've got a there here's an example

353
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,240
of something right my on my on my first current login video I'm gonna contain this rain it has to

354
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,520
be let out I have to let it out on my first current login video right there's been this thread

355
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,040
going on for like since it came out which is like a fucking year now almost it's been like a year

356
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,120
and this one argument has been going on for like fucking the entire time brilliant just just the

357
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,680
other day I finally commented on it myself and was like guys this argument has been going back

358
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,200
and forth about how shit current login is or how not shit it is for like a fucking year it's time

359
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,400
to end it no one is budging let us end the conflict now and you know what happened they were both the

360
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,000
two people who were arguing were like you know what dude you're right let's just move on and I mean

361
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
now some other fucking idiots are commenting on or like they're like reviving the argument and these

362
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,880
guys are actually you couldn't just ban them both the first time it happened a year ago and you

363
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,600
wouldn't be dealing with it ever again but I'm see but these people grew you know these people

364
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,200
were able to learn that that's another that's another bannable offense actually now that you

365
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,200
bring it up people talking amongst themselves on my video that is very annoying when they do that

366
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,480
no you know I don't wanna get shit my video is about a place to fucking whiter outside and talk to

367
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,560
your buddies otherwise cancerous threats something finally good came of it these two people came to

368
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,240
understanding about each other and I think that's valuable you know you annoyed me for a while but

369
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,960
something I guess I mean to me I just think it's they realize they're sinking too much time into it

370
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,320
and they didn't learn anything they're gonna go right back to arguing with other people but see

371
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,560
they did it until I stepped in and told him what's up you know I think that was that kind of moment

372
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,280
that's something that I'm probably the only one has ever happened well then I'm a fucking grunt

373
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,280
that shows the value of comments I fucking broke new ground there you go 97 percent of the time

374
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,120
I don't want to guys shut up let's I'm over with my car god damn me too just we're gonna get so

375
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,360
many fucking comments about how we all talked over each other it's gonna be a oh that's another

376
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,600
way I'm glad you brought up that one because all you fucking maggots out there who listen to

377
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,160
podcasts and complain about people talking over each other have you ever fucking been in a situation

378
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,480
or spoken to other human beings have you ever been in a social fucking interaction situation

379
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,680
do you not understand of course you haven't because you're all fucking autists you don't

380
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,520
understand how friends fucking communicate with each other this is a podcast we're gonna

381
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,120
fucking talk over each other because we're friends having a conversation have you never

382
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,480
fucking had a Thanksgiving dinner with your family you stupid fucking swine also this is over

383
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Skype and there's a delay so the talking over is significantly worse than it would be if you

384
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,000
all went there talking over each other I can't understand what's happening because you're

385
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,320
talking over each other why can't everyone just ring a little bell and wait their turns to say

386
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,280
what they might have said why can't everything be orderly what would you say I would kind of like

387
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:57,360
a little bell well tell him were you saying some more I mean I have a couple points I want to make

388
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,600
but I'll say one for when they're more appropriate the one that I want to kind of jump off of from

389
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,760
what you were talking about with your comment section is something that really kind of pisses me off

390
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,960
and yeah again I agree with everything's digi saying like I think everything he says is valid

391
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,960
like I think there's definitely like an etiquette you should probably be following but I also agree

392
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,880
with you because I've never banned any one of my comments I very rarely delete comments because

393
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,800
I just think like it's an open platform whatever like I can think you're wrong but I'm not going

394
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,240
to stop you but what I was going to say something that really pisses me off in my comment section

395
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,040
and just comment sections in general is when people use the YouTube comment section as their

396
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,760
YouTube channel like if you're going to make a huge long-winded big fucking counterargument

397
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,880
like that's the reason video responses exist you know every time like I thought those disappeared

398
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,800
well I mean oh you mean just make a video yeah which is real it still pisses me off that they

399
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,880
got rid of those me too but like how many times have you seen other other people like put the

400
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,280
script of a video in the comments yeah and it's just like yeah you're just trying to hijack this

401
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,880
like yeah I really wish they could make another video that's much easier to ignore make your own

402
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
channel and do it it's funny you should say that because I did I dumped basically an entire script

403
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,680
about one of uh Jeff's NHK videos and it was probably like one of the longest things I've

404
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,760
you're the problem just don't clearly I guess yeah and I I I brought this up in my video on

405
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,600
closing comments and and Nate I think that's excusable because you and Jeff are friends so

406
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,080
like right right so you can like it it's always different we've been having this argument for

407
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,560
like a week anyway so right and there's there's differences when you have context for it like

408
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,960
Jeff also left a huge comment on my erased video but I completely saw that coming because me and

409
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,040
Jeff have been debating erased for a long time right and it was relevant that poor misguided

410
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,320
our audiences that they've listened to us argue about erased so him leaving a comment on the

411
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,320
video is kind of continuing the narrative in a way that I actually appreciate but like I think that

412
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,360
with with what Tom was saying um like I raised this point in my closing comments video that

413
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,840
you all have platforms I have a youtube channel you can make a youtube channel I have a blog

414
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,240
you can make which is why the whole free speech argument is completely invalid and does not

415
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,800
exactly and and that's and people will say because I've had this argument before where

416
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,680
someone was like well are you saying that like because you're already a big youtuber so if you

417
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,440
say something then everybody's gonna hear it but if I want to respond to it then that means I have

418
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,160
to go make a whole youtube channel and I'm like yeah exactly the reason I get the reason I get to

419
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,000
have this platform is because I write in a way that other people understand and appreciate I have

420
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,240
opinions that people relate to these farmers who just go out one day and harvest like a million

421
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,920
acres of food what like did they earn that shit they didn't do shit they just woke up one day and

422
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,080
they did that it's not like they spent a fucking six months right that field sewing the field growing

423
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,800
the you know like here's the kind of bad here's the comments can be really bitchy comments and

424
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,760
criticize me I see their fucking putrid comments and it's just it's like I'm looking into a sea of

425
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,360
people and they've all got their fucking jaws hanging open because they want to dig in their

426
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,360
mouths here's really the thing that always gets to me is the fact that these comments don't have a

427
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,280
whole lot of effort they didn't put on put in a whole lot of critical thought because you know

428
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,680
comments are literature they're a very low form of literature but that's what they are literature

429
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
is art they're shit I expect you to put in I I expect you to put in some effort some creative

430
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,160
effort I'm glad you like that and here's the thing no matter how no matter how bitchy a comment is

431
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,880
or how uh how much it criticizes me how much I disagree with it how much you could even personally

432
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,360
insult me personal attacks are far less insulting to me than people trying to postulate that my video

433
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,840
is something different than this comment can be anything but if I think it's funny and cleverly

434
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,080
worded I'll let it pass and maybe even thumb it up yeah I will earn my respect oh no I don't have

435
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,600
to be off more than commenters thinking they're funny the vast majority of them sometimes they are

436
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,960
funny oh you shouldn't do this oh you shouldn't do that and they're just not clever it's just it's

437
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,200
just a big waste of my time and that's the thing that you know I want to leave it there's

438
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,880
there's one important point that I want to bring up in regards to that and it's just that I've made

439
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,080
I've made pretty much I've been defending the the usefulness of comments but there is a reality on

440
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,520
the other side of that argument that is there may in fact come a time uh uh uh solid a snake from

441
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,440
Metal Gear Solid 2 he knew what was up one day it is possible that the like any intelligent argument

442
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,160
will be just completely drowned out by the walls of idiocy and just piled on everyone is wrong

443
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,640
about everything and they drown out any kind of responsibility to ban people who say stupid

444
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,520
shit I think that may in fact come a time when that's that's the case and already it's not worth the

445
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,520
time probably like practically I have videos that have gotten like twice the number of comments

446
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,480
that your uh your girl like on no no your final fantasy video has and it's like you know it was

447
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,760
at that level at that point where it just gets too much for me and you know by the way the reason

448
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,200
why I'm so ethically okay with banning is because it saves them time too they're not banned from other

449
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,880
videos well I don't know that's not true because it doesn't save them time they're suffering and I'm

450
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,840
not that's what I like about it I don't think you need to just say this now you could ban every

451
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,600
single person who comments at all if you wanted that'd be totally I have no problem with that because

452
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,320
it's my dream my dream is to wake up one morning and look into my empty comment section and

453
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:19,360
see that I've banned everyone yeah one day you'll get that I consider it important because and I've

454
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,240
been writing about this for for years even before I was nearly as big as I am yeah that the the way

455
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,360
to get a good comment section is by curating it because people will put more effort into your

456
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,600
comments if a they know you read them yeah you sometimes respond to them and see they see that

457
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,160
the other comments are good I'm just I'm just a lez a fair idealist I guess I just think that if I

458
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,640
don't do anything and hope maybe maybe there's a chance more good things will come as a result

459
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,360
it's just you know it's just my philosophy I mean like if you look at PBS idea channels comments

460
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,160
like I don't I don't know if they delete or do anything like that but because everyone knows

461
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,880
that they have a whole comment response thing that they've always done people leave by far the

462
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,800
best comments on YouTube on PBS idea channel every comment will be some long like thought out

463
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,360
really intricate response to the video because everyone wants to get read on the next episode

464
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,440
comments thing it's a cool strategy you know even I've written some like some really detailed

465
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
comments on there and I've been read in a video and yeah you were just mentioned on a video of

466
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,640
theirs well that was for yeah for something else but yeah I you know I have tried to foster that

467
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,040
in my comment section the whole time it's been around I respond to like the most interesting

468
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,440
or intelligent comments or anything I have something to say in in response to I actually like

469
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,080
seeing conversations on my videos when they aren't arguments when people get into long

470
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,360
arguments that's when it's like all right just shut down the whole fucking thread but like

471
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,760
when people just discuss things that that can be really cool because it means that like

472
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,040
I've I've created you know dialogue between people and I like that that's why that's why I

473
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,480
don't just close comments on all my videos because again I like the comments but to me if I want to

474
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,360
keep my comments being good then I have to ban the people who are just spamming bullshit I have to

475
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,680
delete the comments that are that are just fucking stupid because if people scroll down to your

476
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,160
comment section and all they see is a bunch of dumb bullshit then you get stuff like with my

477
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,600
erased video where every fifth comment is someone talking about how shitty the comments are it's

478
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,480
like I can't believe how butthurt everyone is over erased oh half the people are saying it's

479
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,400
shit and the other half are defending it like it's amazing blah blah and like all these comments

480
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
about the comments and I'm like did you did you said you said pen ultimate when you actually meant

481
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,120
ultimate uh let me just leave a quick comment about that we haven't even we're 40 minutes into

482
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,560
this and we haven't even actually started laying down any specific things that we don't like we

483
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,280
should just spend venom well I'm going to go ahead I'm going to go ahead and say what my first rule

484
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,760
is because I wanted I wanted to say this at the very beginning of the podcast because people will

485
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,920
have already broken it yeah the first rule of good comments this is absolute never break this

486
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,560
do not publish a comment before you finish the fucking video that's a good one that's a good one

487
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,040
YouTube should make that feature a button you can press that'd be yeah that'd be good actually

488
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,160
here's here's how you do it guys if you have something to say about something that was said

489
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,720
at the very beginning of a video type it out and then don't hit publish yeah wait until the video's

490
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,280
over because there's a good chance that it's going to be addressed like for instance on my uh on

491
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,760
my video about anime getting lazy with its meta there was a lot of people who would comment things

492
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,680
like did you mix up Ava and Gundam on purpose and then they would come back like they would leave a

493
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,000
second comment like oh now I get it because the whole video was full I like what you're doing

494
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,920
is you're not only laying out a rule you're expressing how to do it correctly you're applying

495
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,880
that see pcb is teaching you people all you have to do is type and I do this all the time I'll watch

496
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,920
it like uh like on I think that was one of DeVu's videos where like I had responses to like six

497
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,400
different points did this happen DeVu did I have a video where I had like six different little

498
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,280
micro paragraphs because what I'll do is I'll respond to like I'll type out whatever my thought

499
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,960
is on what's actually no better example the tbap q&a oh yeah yeah I did this on the tbap q&a

500
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,360
they would answer a question I would type out like something if I had to say it in response and then I

501
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,560
just uh go down to the next line in the comment and I'd wait and then once the video was over I had

502
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,160
like six different points and I published it and they were all there nothing is worse than the guys

503
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,240
who who actually leave a comment after every single thing they have to respond to yeah I get some of

504
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,360
those on digi bros where there's this one kid who will like respond to like like eight times to

505
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,800
phrases that we said throughout the video and I'm like dude just type it all out in one comment

506
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,560
you can even edit you can edit comments yeah but like for fuck's sake wait till the video's over

507
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,000
we we might have addressed what your complaint was and if we haven't then you can fucking

508
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,280
leave a comment which can I can I move on to realize is that every time they every single time they

509
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,880
leave a pointless comment I get a notification for it and I have to go through that emotional

510
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,200
rollercoaster of saying maybe it'll be a decent comment maybe and I have to click on it and then

511
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,320
it comes up and it's like my fucking dog died all over again every single time that I say nothing

512
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,080
my advice is to turn off your notifications device yeah I've had the notifications disabled for like

513
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,920
but then how will I know who to ban because I go I read all my comments through the comments page in

514
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,720
my creator studio because that way I can read the whole comment I'm not interested in solutions I'm

515
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,080
interested in my commenters killing themselves and dying you know uh related to that uh do speaking

516
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,200
of of accountability uh another rule I don't know we're on two two or three or whatever here's an

517
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,440
important rule three always every commenter number three every commenter must enable replies this is

518
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,640
non-negotiable you must allow this issue lately have you guys even been seeing this I have I have

519
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,600
actually I haven't seen this in a while there's nothing more disgustingly cowardly than putting

520
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,520
well here's the thing Nate I don't think any of them know they're doing that yeah this is some stupid

521
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,320
google thing the problem is that with with the with the responses thing it's that if you have

522
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,680
something like you can mark in your youtube options like uh I can only be responded to if I'm in your

523
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,640
contacts and people will have that checked without realizing that it means no one can respond to their

524
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,160
comments I kind of disagree with that one because really I I really hate people responding to my

525
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,800
comments I hate getting replies to my comments and I've often considered turning off replies

526
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,480
on my comments I think what the real issue is and a little bitch and a little bitch I'm more like

527
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,560
a fucking hero Nate I'm a fucking hero in a badass because I don't have time to put up with it you

528
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,480
know what I don't want to hear their stupid bullshit because they're fucking wrong my problem is dumb

529
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,320
and gay and dumb and gay and dumb you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen there in my

530
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,200
fucking kitchen when they're shitting all over men replying to my shit I'll fucking take a fucking

531
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,280
spatula I'll shove it up their nose I'll go up their nose with a rubber hose and I'll spray their

532
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,960
fucking oh so you might hate them replying you mean like you can reply to them but they can't

533
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,080
reply to you but this is like replies in your comment section well I'm saying I'm saying I think

534
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,360
people the problem is not just only not having replies enabled the problem is particularly

535
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,000
when they ask you a question and then don't have yes okay that's what I was trying to do

536
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
it's when they when they ask the problem is that they don't seem to realize that they have

537
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,360
got that's a valuable offense right there I don't want that shit my shit with this I almost feel

538
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,760
I sometimes feel sorry for them because I can tell they don't know right and I have no way to

539
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,160
tell them because I can't respond like there's this dude if you listen to this dude I'll bring

540
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,520
this up on digi bros sometimes once I actually remember there's this dude named reddler red who

541
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,840
responds to a lot of digi bros episodes with like fairly well thought out comments

542
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,400
but he has replies disabled and he'll like ask questions or how long he's been doing this

543
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,280
for months guys and he thinks you don't love him digi he's gonna he's gonna actually commit

544
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,320
suicide he's never like asked about it he's never like responded like hey how come you

545
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,320
don't reply to my comments or something but it's like there's no way and I get a lot of those people

546
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,280
who like ask like questions sometimes questions that I really want to answer but I can't do anything

547
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,920
about it it's just like you're fucked I can't do anything you don't have replies enabled I have no

548
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,720
way to contact you to inform you of this information you know so like yeah please enable your fucking

549
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,520
responses if you didn't know that was a thing now you know make sure you have it enabled if no one's

550
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,320
ever responded to your comments and you're not sure why this is probably why um but yeah wouldn't

551
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,720
that be funny that there's like some really unlikable person who's like oh that must be why

552
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,960
they go when they see it's not true and that's the moment where they break and actually kill

553
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,360
themselves holy shit that's great I really hope we can see that in the news oh god there'll be a

554
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:56,080
picture of all of us this yeah you know and they thought they just had disabled their comments

555
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:03,360
but really nobody likes them oh no all right let's move on I got one I got I got a problem

556
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:12,080
okay here it unsolicited advice and this this this is a big one it happened on my

557
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,840
fuck updates video which the worst thing ever happened it went viral which means I got a

558
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,480
bunch of fucking normies commenting on it with their that's worse than that and it also happened

559
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,640
on a recent video that I made called just rambling we're like also this this is this goes hand in

560
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,520
hand with watching the whole video before you comment because a lot of my videos they tend to

561
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,640
not be what they appear to be and you don't see that until later so I got a lot of people commenting

562
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,640
without finishing it and giving me unsolicited advice because the first half of the video

563
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,120
is that I'm going on this really retarded rambly like wrong like I'm I'm totally wrong in a lot

564
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,360
of places in the rant I say stupid shit I'm like empirically wrong I get facts wrong I completely

565
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,840
missed the obvious solutions right in front of me and I admit that but that's the point I wouldn't

566
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,280
upload it if I wasn't aware of it so like the whole point of the that first part where I'm going

567
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,640
on this long-winded retarded rant is because it leads into the bigger point when I start walking

568
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,240
around outside my house and go on a little adventure and people don't get that they just

569
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,280
assume that I'm some run-of-the-mill douchebag swivel chair reviewer you know sending out a video

570
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,040
to my audience please help me with this problem I need your genius advice and they don't check to

571
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,480
see if anyone else has left the other the same comments they're leaving that's another thing

572
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:34,480
you should oh that's a big one so it's millions they're all the same fucking comment well if you

573
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,920
can't find it you should try this website you should download this media player and it's like

574
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,160
motherfucker if you are watching the video it's safe to say I've solved the fucking problem already

575
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,960
or else you wouldn't be watching the fucking video because it wouldn't exist you idiots this is what

576
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,680
youtube needs have you ever gone to like a help desk or a forum before and you start typing in a

577
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,760
question and all the related things come up it's like is this what you want is this the question

578
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:06,560
you're looking for youtube needs that my audience they can't seem to just accept that I am smarter

579
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:19,040
than you okay if you think that you have some advice or some solution I guarantee you that I've

580
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,040
already thought of it and already done it or addressed it in the very video that you're

581
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,960
watching if you will fucking finish the video before you comment okay you don't need to give me

582
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,360
advice I don't want your advice I'm not asking for your advice I'm asking for you to sit down

583
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,600
shut your fucking mouth and let me do my thing like the genius that I am you fucking peons you

584
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,480
just leave comments open because you want the praise because it's everything you're saying so far

585
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,000
just sounds like you know fuck all comments yes I okay I would love to live in a world we're good

586
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,840
comments that are thoughtful and like you know they have that are relevant and and like well

587
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,000
written and spelled correctly and articulate I would love for that you know what I call those

588
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,240
commenters who leave good comments I call them angels because they don't fucking exist I would

589
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,280
love to remember that time shortly after horseshoe finale came out when all those great comments

590
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,320
were appearing all those crazy theories about the video yes that was awesome that was the best

591
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,720
thing ever and but but but it's just it's drowned out it's totally like it's a drop in the pond

592
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,040
compared to all this should have blown it all up because that information got drowned out he was

593
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,760
right he was right he needs to kill right and solidus is always right he was the hero the patriots

594
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,680
are evil those fucking you know the the the once in a in a great fucking eon when someone writes a

595
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,680
comment that that means something like you inspired me or something or like or like actually picked

596
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,840
something up in the video that actually was my intention and actually theorizes and gets it

597
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,240
right for a change those guys are fucking they're you're all heroes to me if you've ever left a

598
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,040
good comment you deserve a badge of honor you deserve to be you there should be a statue built

599
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,640
for good commenters there should be a hall of fame and but but there's so few in fact actually

600
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,160
but those are the people who keep me coming back those are the reason I don't right that I don't

601
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,960
turn off my entire comment section and I wish to comment or hall of fame I've thought about doing

602
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,280
something like that because uh my my friend ghost lightning he used to have this blog called

603
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,080
ghosts of discussions where like it was just straight up a blog where he would take the best

604
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:24,000
comments from his posts and he would post them on this other blog and like uh it was really

605
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,840
interesting just because it's like he can save and he he was the one who taught me how to like

606
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,880
make a discussion go well because he would respond to every comment he got like no matter how vapid

607
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,640
he would respond to it and therefore he would get these like long intense discussions in his uh

608
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,600
in his um blog posts and so I've always thought about every time I read a comment that's actually

609
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,240
like so good that I want it to be around forever I'm like I really should just open up like a

610
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,720
some kind of site the only problem is it would take effort and I have to go through all my videos

611
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,560
and find all those good comments but like yeah man a good comment like a really good comment

612
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,960
if I've ever hit like on your comment it means you're doing god's work you should just start

613
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,280
doing that now going forward and make a video saying you're doing it and then instantly everyone

614
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,720
will like start shaping up because they want to get on that not a bad idea you know what are the

615
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,440
really good comments they're really good comments that really mean something is patrons and fan art

616
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:25,200
you know those are the only those are the best comments absolutely yeah uh divus rule number

617
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,960
four I was gonna bring up myself read the other comments especially if what you have is a correction

618
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,000
if you look if you're just having like a raw emotional reaction to the video it's understandable

619
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,760
that other people might feel the same way right like maybe your thoughts are well I agree with you

620
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,080
on this point and I think it's but I feel this way about this thing maybe someone else has already

621
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:55,760
said that but you you also feel that way that can be valid but if if it's like uh you said uh

622
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,680
I did this to did you just the other day you said 2005 but it was actually 2004 and then like you

623
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,640
don't like you should assume that someone made that comment immediately because when I put out a video

624
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,840
I get about and by the way going back to the fucking finish the video before you comment

625
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,280
I know if you haven't finished the video if you comment before it's been long enough yeah

626
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,640
for you to finish the video I get I'll post a video that's 20 minutes long and it'll have

627
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,320
fucking 20 comments on it by the time 20 minutes have passed and I'm like I should just every time

628
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,720
I think about deleting them all I always consider like I know you haven't finished it so I should

629
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,760
just delete all of these well they skip to the ending you know they skip to the important part

630
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,040
you know that's all the matter you should just disable comments on every video for the length

631
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,760
of the runtime and then open them up hey you know not a bad idea yeah this has been a problem on

632
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,280
YouTube ever since Steve Wozniak first invented YouTube in 2009 back when he was only available

633
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,880
on the linux os Steve Wozniak sounds like the name of a man who gargles balls from it that's

634
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,680
exactly what that's my comment Tom uh the only problem with that is that you'd have to reload

635
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,920
the page to know that comments were enabled afterwards and I don't think a lot of people

636
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:15,280
would assume that but uh yeah I think I think uh what was I saying right within like minutes

637
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,880
of my video going up everything I've gotten wrong will usually be corrected yeah like if I pronounced

638
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,800
something wrong I'm gonna hear about it immediately and here's the thing I don't care that I pronounce

639
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,360
something wrong it does not matter yeah you have to understand you have to understand reading a

640
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,360
script is hard you'll notice that all those accurate youtubers who pronounce everything right

641
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:42,080
talk like this hey everyone because you guys are completely wrong on this one

642
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,120
pronouncing things wrong is the greatest sin that any human being can commit

643
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,960
listen if you have ever left a comment criticizing someone's pronunciation

644
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:11,920
fucking kill yourself kill yourself Jesse kill yourself you deserve to die

645
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,200
hey all right Jesse hang on if I make a mistake editing and I know I made a mistake oh

646
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,400
shit I made a mistake but I uploaded it anyway am I immune from criticism no I'm I fucked up

647
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,640
well I don't I don't want your fucking criticism I don't care

648
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,680
world where you're going around making mistakes all the time like some rank amateur maybe you can

649
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,760
get corrected but I don't make mistakes I actually pronounce amateur the fuck up I pronounce everything

650
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,760
correctly all the time and no one can ever correct me because I'm the correct guy get out of here

651
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,520
I mean yeah Jesse if you correct my pronunciation please kill yourself yeah I do not I don't

652
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,680
care I don't fucking care there's nothing I care about less if you under listen if you correct my

653
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,360
pronunciation that means you understood the word well enough that you knew what the correct word

654
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:17,360
was therefore I've communicated my fucking point you fucked it up it's a mistake it's not a fuck

655
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,760
if you understand what the word is annoying when I when I'm the only purpose of words is to

656
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,360
communicate ideas if you understand the ideas and the word has been communicated there is no

657
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,560
necessity to pronounce it a certain way it is fucking irrelevant I want to hear more about the

658
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,120
communication to deliberately throw some shit out there like cacophony and it just throws the flow

659
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,240
of the whole video off that's right Jesse's right right out of it it picks me up look it breaks

660
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,040
we argued about this the other day I agree that if he's the way he said cacophony if it's

661
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,600
distracting and it makes the video worse for you that's a valid feeling but to say you pronounced

662
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,360
it wrong is completely irrelevant you should pronounce your pronunciation has made this video

663
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,680
worse for me that's why your video your visual audio medium they're not judging it on based on I

664
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,960
don't want them to judge it I don't care about their judgments it's a piece of pro i don't want

665
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:23,680
to listen to their complaints about my art youtube is the only place that you can release the kind

666
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,440
of art that we're making and we have to make the platform better that's the point of this whole

667
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,960
podcast if you're saying somebody's name in a video you should have the respect for them to

668
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,520
pronounce it correctly the way god and nature intended and if you're saying the name of like

669
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,920
like like like a word from a foreign language like a japanese word you better fucking pull your

670
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,640
eyes slanted and fucking say it like they do and fucking show a bunch of stupid I don't want to hear

671
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,400
this from the guy who makes entire videos about pronouncing everything japanese wrong and that's

672
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,720
the joke of the video everything correctly when I say that fucking sega genesis attack on Gundam

673
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,800
is my favorite anime of all time where's the respect there you fucking piece of shit

674
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,560
even though it was just said I wasn't even I didn't even hear what you just said

675
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,920
I said attack on Gundam is my favorite anime where's the respect there what are you talking about

676
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,360
animal is hilarious yeah it's yeah that doesn't mean it's respectable you're wrong on purpose

677
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,600
because it's funny that's a whole lot different than being totally serious and accidentally being

678
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,720
an idiot with the way I grasping it straws digi jesse I think this is as you have it there is never

679
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,280
a time when correcting pronunciation in the comments makes you not a piece of shit

680
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,680
I will fucking die on this hill there is no there is no context in which correcting my pronunciation

681
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,880
will make me feel like you haven't become a worse person in my eyes there is no context you're too

682
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,360
sensitive man you gotta you gotta accept that you just make what is sensitive about that mistakes

683
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:02,640
and you need to be corrected I know I made mistakes I don't care I don't care you are shit

684
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,880
for complaining about it babe your video is objectively worse because you made a mistake

685
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,200
now correct me there's no such thing as objectivity that's not a thing now listen I don't

686
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,560
what you guys don't realize is at least in earlier digi videos a lot of his mispronunciations were

687
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,760
not like things that he was unaware of it's because I have a similar problem right I'm not as I'm not

688
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,120
as vocally talented as jesse is who can just amazingly put out amazing vocal performances

689
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,040
it's really hard how dare you leave a comment on my vocal performances how dare you say anything

690
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,400
about anything I've done ever I'll kill you listen I spent I just came out with a video

691
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,680
that would have come out two days earlier if not for the fact that I have to get up behind the microphone

692
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,680
I can get out maybe five minutes of a good performance then I gotta go eat work out go to

693
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,160
the bathroom it takes me hours to psych myself up and oh my god we've got a badass over here

694
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,880
because I'm talking a bit too fast or a bit too slow maybe you know my tongue will slip

695
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,200
or it's just so hard to focus that's the job that's the job if you can't do it go be a writer

696
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,800
that's not the fucking job that's that's fucking retarded my job is not to pronounce shit right

697
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,920
listen agonize over making sure that every single people aren't the same guy

698
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,960
I know you're correct I spend my hours on this day

699
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:25,680
I don't believe for I don't believe that there's any difference between saying

700
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,800
you pronounce that word wrong and saying you wrote your review wrong there's no difference

701
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:36,160
you don't know what my intent was look my intention was not necessarily to pronounce everything right

702
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,080
because I don't give a fuck about pronouncing everything right that doesn't make my video

703
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,360
those are those having a wrong script is one error pronouncing a word wrong in the script is

704
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:52,320
another error it's not it's not a fucking error because I am not necessarily trying to write

705
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,400
something that's going to pull people out of the list you think I want my videos to be in English

706
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,600
what makes you think that the goal of my videos is to even be in English you don't know that

707
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:07,760
it might sound a lot my video might sound a lot like English but that doesn't mean that that's what

708
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,800
my goal is did you hear you're lost you're in the woods now I can't listen to me let me break this

709
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,960
down let me break this down for you all right I like the way the word niche sounds I don't like

710
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,280
the way the word I don't like the way the word niche sounds I like the way the word niche sounds

711
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,640
so when I read my script your opinion on what is correct is not relevant right yes it is Nate

712
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,640
because I get to decide what I think is better aesthetically in my video you do not get to

713
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,760
if you think that niche sounds better all right you can go fucking die because that's not the point

714
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,760
of my video it's not to appease what you want me to sound like you say it's not the point but the

715
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,280
point of every video you make is to communicate ideas like your bill I did communicate the idea

716
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,760
you knew what I meant retard who the heck did decide the way you pronounce things Nate it's in the

717
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,160
god damn you can look it up online how to pronounce these words it's not exactly 10 different

718
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,760
results god damn it shut up if you look at pronunciation online every single pronunciation

719
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:10,000
is different it's a god damn language we have ways of pronouncing things that's a load of shit

720
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,480
everyone knows the first rule of language is that it's flexible if you talk to anyone who studies

721
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,600
language they'll talk about how the second language the word change is fucking stupid

722
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:26,000
and weird then you say it a better way listen I want if if my goal is for everyone in the

723
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,040
world to start saying niche that I'm gonna keep saying niche so that I can eventually turn everyone

724
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:36,240
into saying words the way I want them to be said I am a pundit for my ideas pinch shunt because I

725
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,120
think pinch shunt sounds way it sounds cooler nobody gives a shit how do you think it sounds cooler

726
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,240
it's not about what sounds cooler can I just say the the whole the whole crux of this argument is

727
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:53,520
you're making an error who cares though I don't think does that make your point less

728
01:02:53,680 --> 01:03:00,880
I don't I care that I agree I agree with you that a who does who cares but I also don't think

729
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,720
it's something really weird but I still understand that I'm not gonna say well I don't really like

730
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,600
them or that video there's a very simple point there's a very simple point you made about this

731
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,600
and it's the fact that every single one of us who watched that bunny hop video when he said

732
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,960
cacophony we were like what what the fuck was that cacophony we all did it take when he said

733
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,440
cacophony it actively made the video that's pretty cool that's right it was a distraction

734
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,160
and that was exactly counter to what I didn't mind to make well I mean I minded it in the sense

735
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,480
that you mind it because you're insane the only thing I remember from the video that's right

736
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,320
exactly exactly that's the problem I remember everything from the video and it didn't bother

737
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,840
me slightly because I'm not a piece of shit I don't remember anything I don't I don't give a fuck

738
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:47,200
about cacophony I don't like it you're all shit I don't agree you are the worst commenters I hope

739
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,560
you die no fuck you and fuck anyone who pronounces words grievously wrong okay you know what there

740
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,320
are some words there are some words that I'll go either way on okay I don't have an opinion on

741
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:01,520
niche or niche it can it sounds it sounds fine either way but there are some fucking words

742
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:06,480
that just sound retarded when people say them wrong like cacophony I'm gonna have to agree with

743
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,600
that listen Jesse I agree that cacophony sounds stupid and cacophony sounds better and cacophony

744
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,560
is one of my favorite words I'd love it if more people said it and said it correctly but leaving

745
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:22,800
a comment on bunny hops video is the same as leaving any other shitty comment if you want to

746
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,840
talk about why everyone's why he's wrong make your own video about how to pronounce cacophony

747
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:44,480
if your problem with how he says cacophony is that you think it should be pronounced different

748
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,440
that's not his problem it's your problem it's the standard of the language the standard of the

749
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,840
language is always being changed they update the dictionary they update pronunciations you know

750
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:01,040
I had a I made a video Nate I made a video once the first video I ever got really shat on for

751
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:06,480
pronunciation was when I said feminity instead of femininity that was too much all right I'm not

752
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,920
with you look you say that but feminity used to be a fucking word that used to be how it was said

753
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,680
I looked it up I did the research feminity was originally the word femininity became the word

754
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,000
because people liked the way it sounded more which means the language it means nothing but

755
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,440
bullshitting what they like feminity sounds retarded whether it's whether it's technically

756
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:35,120
correct or technically not correct it sounds dumb so we changed it my point is that there is no

757
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:41,840
objective idea of what it means because it changes based on people's tastes meaning that when you

758
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,440
leave a comment that someone's pronouncing something wrong that's just your taste that's just your

759
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:51,680
opinion it's not objective there is no objective failure because objectivity isn't real right there

760
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:58,000
because the way the objectivity is is incorrect because what is objective is that we do have

761
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,280
a standard in the language that we have most of us it's it's a democratic process and we have decided

762
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,960
that we are going to pronounce as an english language cacophony not cacophony my videos

763
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:15,600
are not a democratic process my videos are things that i post to share my at this point at this point

764
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,320
i'd like to reiterate that this is not an argument about whether it's an objective fact that when

765
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,000
people pronounce things differently than how everyone else pronounces it it sounds weird

766
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,040
and it throws people off that's an it does sound weird i'd just i'd like to say that you just don't

767
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,400
have a big enough of a viewer base nor do i for there to be a large contingent of people it would

768
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,360
never happen to me because i pronounce everything correctly all of them just think that until until

769
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,560
you get enough people with different opinions no see that's just that's just that's just the wrong

770
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,640
way of looking at it jesse that's just hiding when you say that you say that you know you said it

771
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:52,240
sounds weird and wrong and that's kind of like when people go to your videos and they say the way

772
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,040
that you present your ideas is weird and wrong to me it's it's no that's totally different there is

773
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:02,000
no standard for how jesse should make his videos there should be no standard for language just like

774
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,560
there should be no standard for art did you i have a really important question where did you write that

775
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,120
shut up did you shut up shut up shut up no he said there should be no standard and that's

776
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:26,640
let the man speak i just want to say that i don't mind the whole mispronouncing things

777
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:32,560
as much as nate seems to because honestly i don't even hate it that much i don't even care what you

778
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:40,000
seem to i don't really give a shit okay i'm sorry go on go on i just the reason i don't mind it so

779
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
much is because i grew up in a place where loads of people had loads of different accents and i'm

780
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,360
just like if i hear cacophony or cacophony or whatever i'm just like oh and then i just

781
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,160
nobody knows what we're talking about by the way nobody has seen the super funny

782
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,600
what i was trying to say is that we gotta link it in the description yeah did you i want to ask you

783
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,520
the whole this discussion is pointless because all we're talking about is how much nate and or you

784
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:09,120
know how much any any of us cares about mispronunciations it's got nothing to do with comments let's

785
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,840
drop this whole subject who's super willing to accept people pronouncing words any way they want

786
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,800
the reason it bothers me so much is that i listen to the all kinds of reason that you're so

787
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,320
sensitive because you pronounce shit wrong all the time you know that's i listen to all kinds of

788
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:28,080
videos with people with weird accents who pronounce everything differently from how i'm used to and

789
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,520
i just assume well he comes from a different culture he has a different accent than me he

790
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,040
pronounces things differently where is george weedman that's how that's how i feel and people

791
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:45,200
because of the fact that most of the words i say sound like standard american english they

792
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:51,600
assume i don't have an accent but i have an accent it's just that only certain elements of the things

793
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,720
i say sound different it's only when i start saying shit like y'all which i say all the time

794
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:02,560
that people start realizing oh he's from the south and he says things in a different way and there's

795
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,440
words that i've learned in a way that's different from how other people have learned them and when

796
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:13,680
i use those words people complain at me because they don't think of it as he has an accent they

797
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:19,440
think of it as he's just saying words wrong i know the context just like all the other problems

798
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,920
did you have a question no no you're oversimplifying and that's wrong comments did these pronunciation

799
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,240
comments bother you this much when they first started happening here and there because i feel like

800
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:33,760
always bothered me there you go your point is invalid i have always been bothered by pronunciation

801
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,480
comments because of the fact simply as i said earlier with accent though you don't have a southern

802
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,200
accent it's not your act if someone is speaking in an accent and they're pronouncing words differently

803
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,320
i can interpret that in my brain and i don't get because you only think but that only doesn't

804
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,680
weird you out because it sounds so much like a clear accent what i'm saying is that i have an

805
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:59,760
accent it just sounds a lot like normal english but that doesn't mean it's not an accent there's

806
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,040
certain words that just i just say differently i don't hear that do you hear that hippo normal

807
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:10,800
english look is there a difference is there a difference between an accent and saying something

808
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,120
wrong definitely is there even a difference i would say yes i think i would say yes i think that

809
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,160
there are times when you when like there are some words there's a spectrum though there are some

810
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,360
words that i have said wrong because i've never heard them spoken before and i've only i've only

811
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,720
read them online and i've never heard them spoken so i say it and i pronounce it wrong and sometimes

812
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:36,640
someone corrects me on it and i i look it up and i go okay that makes sense i'll pronounce it that

813
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,720
way from now i pronounce the word bosom for like 10 years so there's a lot of words that are like

814
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,960
that there is other words that i that i pronounce wrong because i've said it for so long that that's

815
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:55,360
just how i say it like for instance i cannot pronounce bakemonogatari i cannot do it that sounds

816
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,840
fine no it's not like it should be well i actually did get closer to how i usually um closer than i

817
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,200
usually do but it should be bakemonogatari right dude you're not japanese it's forgiven but i you

818
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,160
have an american accent i always say bakemonogatari that's literally perfect that's literally perfect

819
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,760
what's wrong no it's not there's an e instead of an a at the end i've gotten complaints about it all

820
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,680
the time that i say bakemonogatari wrong because i say that e at the end instead of an a and it's

821
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:27,200
because i cannot in the in the context of reading a script i cannot say it the other way because

822
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,160
i've been saying it for like eight years okay well bakemonogatari because it sounds natural

823
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,600
literally a problem with you i can't when i try to read a script and i try to say niche it sounds

824
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,640
so fucking weird because i have to stop everything and over pronounce that word i did it in a video

825
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,760
recently where i was like it's feeling a certain niche you have to have some video some audio fidelity

826
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,880
you have to fucking accept that that it sounds wrong if you say it that way though did you just

827
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,680
motors through his scripts and doesn't pay any heed to them i think they sound better that way

828
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,080
i think when you over pronounce words and you talk slow you sound like a fucking nerd and i don't

829
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,480
want to listen to you i want to listen to people who sound natural who sound like using the voice

830
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,000
that they use in their everyday life criticizing the things that you've admitted are objectively

831
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,480
wrong just aren't allowed to say anything i'm saying that they that i'm saying that they're

832
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,960
missing the point of the video they're missing that the reason i talked the way i feel is because

833
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,000
i want the scripts to sound fast and if you had your way george bush would still be in office

834
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,480
and we'd all be pronouncing strategy as strategic that's the world if i had my way did you if i had

835
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:37,680
my way then then miss miss underestimating would definitely be a word all right i detected the

836
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,520
problem i've detected that's that's the george bush word and it is that you think that these

837
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,320
comments are somehow taking away from the other conversation of the video i don't see why that

838
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,640
has to be the case i don't think that they do i think they do look and here's the other problem

839
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,320
is that they can they can also be the death of of jokes and inside jokes i for instance i could

840
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,360
never get away with saying simultaneously in my videos because people would go what the fuck

841
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:07,120
are you talking about but to all of us that's hilarious because the time cube guy says simultaneously

842
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,040
so like i would love to write that into a script but what am i going to get a hundred million

843
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:18,000
comments going do you pronounce it wrong like and like maybe maybe cacophony was intended to sound

844
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,200
weird in that video we don't know that we do really don't we don't know you can infer based on tone

845
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:29,040
you can infer you can infer but that doesn't mean you know how many times have you been

846
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:35,520
farcical on purpose and people don't get it yeah but you don't look it's not his job to make something

847
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,080
that you will completely appreciate and understand it's his job to make his art if you leave a comment

848
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,080
saying that you weren't understandable that's no different from that comment that guy left on my

849
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,640
erased video saying this wasn't helpful to everybody my goal wasn't to be helpful to everybody

850
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,240
now if if i said if i came out and i said hey guys where are the mistakes in this video that

851
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,280
made it harder to understand then you commented that that would be great if i if i actually came

852
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,520
out and said hey where did i pronounce things wrong tell me i want to know i want to correct

853
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,400
myself and make my videos more understandable to more people then yes please you are constantly

854
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,800
asking that question by releasing a video that contains your speech i do not think so i think

855
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,880
that's bullshit i think it's pretty funny that uh that a podcast about like shitty comments has

856
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,920
essentially turned into a toxic comment section with all of us yelling this is the most intense

857
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,200
debate we've had yet on pcp i feel i just like to say that all of you since you're american are

858
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:34,160
always sounding wrong to me because i am english right yeah so he just said always no one ever

859
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:41,440
complains that he says always instead of always yeah and that seems it seems natural to you because

860
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:47,440
all the words he says sound are we even disagreeing anymore i think we pretty much i hope not all

861
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,880
right can we just move on what's the next thing that you shouldn't do in your comments we can

862
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,360
take away from that because i don't don't complain about pronunciation no complain all you want

863
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,800
back no the rule is don't work and if you do complain about pronunciation control f the

864
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,440
fucking thread so i don't have to read okay literally 700 we can all agree we can all agree

865
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,840
one is enough when it comes to that we can all agree on oh and and here's another thing about

866
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,640
the pronunciation thing it's one thing to correct the pronunciation but when i get comments like

867
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,320
the way he says kilua makes me want to fucking stab my ears out well get over yourself you fucking

868
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,840
piece of shit like like like me pronouncing a word wrong has like somehow given you cancer

869
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,240
that's the exact comment that i left on super bunny ops video i said the way you're pronounced

870
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:37,120
to cough and he gave me an aneurysm i mean that's just a that's a comedic thing it's just like

871
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,840
like the way you said it is kind of funny there are people who have left comments like they were

872
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:48,160
legitimately offended by the way that i pronounced kilua in my video dude i don't i clearly we're

873
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,360
coming to this from different angles because because i have committed federal crimes yeah

874
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,600
once you're all once you all get the level of comments i fucking get i want you to come back

875
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,640
and have this conversation all right when you've got a video with 700 comments insulting your

876
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,280
pronunciation and come back and tell me i'm just saying i'm defending ideas here i don't even think

877
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,720
the way i mean how lucky are you that you said it's gurren laggin time and no one said anything

878
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,960
about it lag on i said gurren no you said you say at the beginning of the video you say

879
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:21,680
it's gurren laggin time i did not say it i did not say it's gurren lagoon i totally remember it

880
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,760
being wrong i remember you should have called it gurren lagoon it would have been way funnier

881
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:32,080
do the whole video over i want to go live in gurren lagoon that's gonna be my japanese anime

882
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,840
all right let's move on let's move on what's the next rule it should be gurren lagoon

883
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:43,680
why'd you edit that down what who's got a rule let me compose myself Jesus Christ yeah i had to

884
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,000
take a second that was an epic debate hippo hippo say something while i try to think about my next

885
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:55,040
okay okay i got one okay oh i've got a good one though my blood is like no give it has rule

886
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:02,880
give it has rule i got a rule i got a rule okay don't ever don't ever post a comment for the

887
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:09,920
express purpose of getting plus ones because it's just completely pointless and it's so obvious i have

888
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,960
the strength to comment on this video anyway i think i think i mean stuff like i think hippo

889
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,880
means stuff like uh am i the only one who thinks this show is good yeah here's a rule here's a rule

890
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,760
never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

891
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,440
start a comment with am i the only one who don't do it i'll fucking murder your whole family that's

892
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,200
a bannable offense that's the worst possible comment you could ever make no you're not the only one

893
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,080
everyone is fucking thinking the same thing you're not special you don't matter you're gonna die one

894
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:48,560
day and i hope it's today fuck you you know i think that's all that needs to be said about that

895
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,240
plundering

896
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,320
given you should be leading this debate short sweet until the given gets it right there i can't

897
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,320
wait to see the commenters on this video like tripping over themselves to do it right ironically

898
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,720
say that oh yeah that's another one that's another bannable offense when i'm when i say in a video

899
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:11,440
don't make this particular comment and then they make that exact comment to be cute you're not being

900
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:16,160
cute you're not being funny you're not clever oh my god aids and cancer at the same time that's a

901
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,720
once again cuteness doesn't solve any problem it cuteness does not excuse anything it never

902
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,760
solved anything the way never when i said don't i when i said comments about the beard will be

903
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:33,040
deleted i really regret that i didn't say they that you will be banned yeah these people would

904
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,600
have there still would have been the only reason i didn't do that is because i actually was a little

905
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:43,760
afraid that i'd have to ban all my commenters like i was seriously like if i say that they're not

906
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,960
like they're not gonna believe like they're not gonna understand that i really mean that

907
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,680
and i will ban them all i've just realized we have completely opened ourselves up to a wall of

908
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:58,480
ironic comments it's gonna be yeah and we can ban them all yeah because they're all and all

909
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,600
and then people who commented before they got to this point that's you're gonna probably

910
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,240
you shouldn't listen to rule number one you gotta watch the whole video you're gonna get

911
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:16,160
definitely serious and you will always be banned from this there will be dozens and dozens maybe

912
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:22,320
hundreds of future pcp episodes and you will be egging to say stuff and you won't get to say any

913
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:30,000
of it and you will be crying on that day and will bury you you had to bury you in a termite

914
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,320
mountain termites will bite your dick until you're dead i'll put a baseball mitt full of ants on your

915
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:43,200
balls and they'll bite you on the balls i love how they bite your balls devoo always

916
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:48,080
frames every time someone offends someone in this group he always frames it as once we are really

917
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:54,560
famous you're gonna be so mad that's always i like that optimize when i'm king i will remember

918
01:19:54,560 --> 01:20:00,640
everyone who slighted me and i will send assassins out across the far corners of the world to slay

919
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:08,800
to slay all the commenters date to put this simply yeah you can if you've already thought of the

920
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:16,400
phrase you can say it with me ironic shitposting is still shitposting yes that's the one that's the

921
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,960
one so how about we get to the the one that is my least my most hated one okay the arrogant smug

922
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,120
tone which people don't realize is a big problem they don't wait a minute devoo don't start tone

923
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:32,320
policing because that's a bannable offense for me i can't stand that shit okay for the content

924
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,720
all right listen when people say that the internet is a huge hive of scum and villainy the internet

925
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:44,480
is a full of a bunch of terrible people they are not talking about fourchan they're not talking about

926
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,640
people who say you're a fag with in all lower case i mean those guys are a big problem right

927
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:55,680
but the problem the problem with the internet is people who are like my friend you have really

928
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,400
disappointed me this is not good at all this is nothing i just got one of those right before

929
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:07,120
we started this fucking day sir the phrase my friend should be like autoband they always end

930
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,600
it with good day the one the ones i've seen the worst were on tom's video recently because

931
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,440
everyone's like dude what happened to love and tolerate brother i'll really let us down the

932
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:22,320
worst is when they combine that with hypocrisy when they're pissed like they're bitching at you for

933
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:28,400
being smug in a smug tone yeah don't ever don't ever dare to talk to me like some disappointed

934
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:33,520
parental figure or some friend you're not my friend the only one if you want to be my friend

935
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:41,520
become a patron at patreon.com slash ben saint mother fucker because look guys look guys being a troll

936
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,520
being an asshole being a flamer does not i mean okay look capitalization spelling that's a small

937
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,000
variable but that is not precluded there's so many people who will make something that's obviously

938
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,240
obviously meant to piss you off it's obviously trolling it's obviously baiting but they have

939
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:04,400
a decent vocabulary and they capitalize their their words and sentences and stuff and they think

940
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:09,040
that because they spelled everything right and didn't have too many exclamation marks it's all

941
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,200
about the exclamation marks right or words that are in all caps they think that's the definition

942
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:17,440
of trolling no it's not the definition of trolling is whether or not it pisses someone off and it

943
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,720
was intended to be so and so many people will come out with passive-aggressive smarmy terrible

944
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:28,400
comments and it will think that they're being they're they're fair criticism that's the fair

945
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,480
criticism nothing it says nothing works it's the song you guys have to understand there are so many

946
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,320
times and i think all of you guys would agree with this there are many times where i will add a bunch

947
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:43,920
exclamation marks or capitalize words to make me sound stupid to lower myself that's being humble

948
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,080
in my book and i can't do that anymore i used to do that more often where i'd be balanced where i

949
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:53,200
wanted to be like fun and and just like a normal person i'd be like you suck good you know like

950
01:22:53,200 --> 01:23:00,080
even in this very chat like i'll say like these people these wine these scum will utilize they

951
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:05,280
will they will not let you get away with that they when someone gets into a flame war with you right

952
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,320
they are on turbo alert mode looking for anything you say that has two exclamation marks or more

953
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:15,840
so that they can then posit you as this you as this troll angry guy right they're looking for

954
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,320
anything they can use to discredit you you know and nothing bothers me more than hold it in their

955
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:26,720
heart and use it for for everything it's worth they will milk anything they can find to make it seem

956
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:32,080
like oh you're just being a big violent jerkface don't you realize and this is another fallacy

957
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:37,600
or as did you would say a fallacy that you can see around all of discussion is um i call it the uh

958
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,040
the first amendment kicks in when i get uncomfortable fallacy right which is i make a video

959
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:48,160
that's my free speech you make a comment that's your speech too i make a reply that's my speech

960
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,320
you make a reply that's your speech but then i make a reply that's really logical and trumps

961
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:58,480
trumps all of your ideas and now all of a sudden i'm trampling on i'm trampling on your ideas all

962
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:03,840
of a sudden the for all of a sudden the oppression begins when you run out of arguments right this

963
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,840
is the problem i've seen ever since the internet was invented in 1975 this this is the most substantive

964
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,800
complaint yet to do and i i very much agree i very much agree you know the saddest part about that

965
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:21,440
fallacy thing is that uh my best rap i ever wrote for the jephard jesson's father's following of

966
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,840
and i i can't like once i found out that that was the wrong pronunciation i thought oh gary no one

967
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,800
probably can take this seriously and i can't change it because the entire rhyme screen scheme is based

968
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:39,600
on it being pronounced i pronounce it fagotry that's a good way to pronounce it uh yeah no

969
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:47,200
smarm drives me crazy because it's this this whole attitude of if you don't have something nice to

970
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:54,080
say don't say anything at all but then you say that in in a bitchy way and it's like the what we need

971
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,400
to be doing as a society is getting to the point not being nice not not arguing in a way that fits

972
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,960
your parameters of how an argument should be it's getting to the point that world of only saying

973
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,600
nice things is is the medley or solitude nightmare you know that in one of my videos in one of my

974
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,080
videos i say faggot at one point which is very weird because my videos have very few squaring but

975
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,760
there's one time where i decide to use faggot right and i got some comments complaining about it

976
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,440
whatever and there was one that was like i can't believe you do that and i was like you know man

977
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,120
you know whatever yada yada and it shut up you faggot that would have been my response i have a

978
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,200
beautiful example for this one you're done by the way so okay because then you said just you know

979
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:35,280
shut up about it saying faggot is really annoying and i was like uh you know i i actually upvoted

980
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,360
that comment because he's just saying he just he stopped being all smarmy i want to elaborate on

981
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:45,520
that don't say that i was going to bring this up uh you people on the internet you commenters

982
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,440
you have ruined the word faggot for me forever like what is what a shame what a shame faggot

983
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:56,000
louis ck saved it and then it got ruined faggot yeah louis ck made people realize that they could

984
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,480
say it and then they went way too far with it like yeah faggot is like one of my favorite words

985
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:08,480
ever in the world it it's a beautiful word and it describes a person so nebulous that they can only

986
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:15,040
be described with that word which is why i am very careful with how i use the word faggot i only say

987
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,000
when there's an impact to it when it really matters and means what i'm trying to say it takes faggot

988
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,840
compilation you'll see exactly artistry at work every every time i've ever said faggot has been

989
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:29,360
totally 100 the best possible word i could have used at that given time but people throw faggot

990
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:35,200
around so much nowadays that it just robs the word of any agency and any impact and any meaning

991
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,320
and it drives me insane uh i you know i kind of disagree i i think the fact that it's so meaningless

992
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,920
is what i like it's not meaningless it describes a specific person that you can't describe with any

993
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,400
other word that's why it's so important to keep it put it perfectly when he said yeah you know the

994
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,520
he pulls the dick out of his mouth and says people from phoenix or phoenicia yeah shut up faggot

995
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,480
shut up and suck that dick yeah like that made perfect sense and unfortunately yeah i think it

996
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:05,520
has i agree with jesse that it's been ruined for me by other people and like i've tried to sort of

997
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,480
replace it with fuckboy because it means yeah that was great it describes the same kind of person

998
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:16,080
but it doesn't have it's too fun like faggot still sounds like an insult rest fuckboy is a little bit

999
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:22,400
too much you know how faggot should be used faggot should be like the nuclear option the kill code

1000
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,600
like yeah like it should like randy orton's head punt he never he never uses it except sometimes

1001
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,000
that when he uses it the guy is like injured for eight months it should be like when you're like

1002
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
running down some guy with a huge string of insults you're stupid and you're dumb and you're gay and

1003
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,440
you're a homo and you're ugly and you're fat and you're dumb and you're dumb and you're dumb and

1004
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:45,920
you're a fucking faggot and then they're dead they are that's the way to do it by the way can

1005
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,160
can we hear tom's example yeah i was gonna say the same thing well i mean we've we've kind of gone

1006
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,880
off the rails went a different direction i was going to say how i just i don't like it when people

1007
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:01,760
will will when you use like words like that when you use like risqué language or whatever and they

1008
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:07,200
just fucking are on your dick on it instantly and like they take that holier than that thing like

1009
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:12,320
when i said rape corporate raping of your childhood in the power puff girls video and then i just got

1010
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,320
this guide like in before i'd even made it public i don't know how we found it i think i put in a

1011
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,960
playlist or something and just fucking like when i'll preachy on me about how i'm not allowed to

1012
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,640
use that word you need to stop normalizing rape with that kind of language brother that is not

1013
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:29,760
accepted exactly what he said okay so i think you guys might want some guidelines but hang on

1014
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:35,040
before before we get into that debut let me point out right now on dictionary dot com the third

1015
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:40,480
definition of rape is an act of plunder violence seizure that's exactly what i said i responded

1016
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,600
with that or violation it is the exact correct word to use for that yeah so people need to

1017
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,360
fuck off that's what i said and then some of the respondents me saying that it's like citing the

1018
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:58,240
dictionary is offensive what we know the dictionary isn't isn't what describes words people

1019
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:04,080
decide what words mean and well i will say that sometimes people will be like oh you're not using

1020
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,400
this word the exact way i would which they're using it wrong and like go look up the definition one

1021
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:14,400
one time one guy said go look up the definition of the world should he misbed he misspelled word

1022
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,920
would and i got on his ass for that all right listen you guys want some i just want to say real

1023
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,680
quick tom i don't think i've ever wanted to kill a man more than i have based on what you just

1024
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,800
described to me but okay debu let's actually i before debu continues actually sorry i keep cutting

1025
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:32,320
you off but mate i have to know yeah with your final fantasy seven video okay where you like

1026
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:40,240
literally depicted a rape of yep oh yeah how did that go over you know amazingly i only got one

1027
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:44,960
comment that said like ooh was a little uncomfortable with that last scene but overall great video

1028
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,920
amazing i was like oh my god when you put that in i know i was debating whether or not i should

1029
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,000
just remove it entirely but people actually were okay with it except for one guy who was only a

1030
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,640
little uncomfortable but and and that video got like 25 000 views and only one comment really

1031
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,080
was amazing okay so i got one winner i like to think that it was due to my jovial tone

1032
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,640
overall people were accepting anybody let's go on so you guys want some advice on how to not be

1033
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:14,720
smarmy right so first point don't have short sentences short sentences with very few words

1034
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:20,400
and lots of periods and redundant terminology using the same words over and over again the same

1035
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,880
words all the time people do that deliberately to piss you off it makes them sound like they're so

1036
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:30,480
i don't know why it is nothing is more passive it's very nothing is more passive aggressive than

1037
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:36,320
no you don't because yeah yeah this is how it you know i've got exactly what the dude said

1038
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,200
oh really okay okay you know i don't like it's true long comments are bad uh short comments are

1039
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,880
maybe a little bit better but you know you should just take it the one step further and just not

1040
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:51,040
comment which is really the ultimate uh conclusion i'd like to get to here just don't comment that's

1041
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,840
the biggest rule just don't you know go away if you've ever seen the welcome to youtube video

1042
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:05,920
yeah where he said uh hit now for how to comment don't yeah it stands for this don't it stands for

1043
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:11,520
don't i think this is the number one point i can make about how to not be a big smug prick

1044
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:18,480
uh just represent yourself instead of saying this video uh offended this group minority that

1045
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:24,640
i don't represent instead of saying this video has broken this law of conduct and this video has

1046
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:31,840
done this wrong this video has violated this this memo no you have to you have to defend your idea

1047
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:38,240
yeah just say this just stick with this this video pissed me off you know what right that

1048
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,880
kind of comment wouldn't really bother me you see it's it's not the fact that people just look

1049
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,120
people just liking a video of mine you know that's kind of disappointing right but what

1050
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:53,520
offends me is when people try to represent something beyond themselves all you gotta do is

1051
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,440
there's nothing that's more annoying that people getting offended on other people's behalf that's a

1052
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:02,480
big problem that's a universal thing you can see in in comments they're big smug people is that they

1053
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,040
always they don't seem to think that they themselves are a valuable resource like go out to their

1054
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,560
garage and sit on a squat over the car and just poop on it i want to poop on your car as a human being

1055
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:18,160
i have enough respect for you that if you say something such and such bothers me i can respect

1056
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:23,120
that i can respect that that's how you feel about something but it's that they didn't try to make

1057
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:28,240
it that i make it out like a sort of imaginary rule book for videos that i'm violating which isn't

1058
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:33,760
true that's like i don't know what the definition we gotta stop devu i know you're trying to like

1059
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,760
just continue your point even though jesse is mumbling i want to go into your house with a

1060
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,440
tooth drive and i want to say i want to poop in the hard to find places so you don't know where

1061
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:45,200
the smell is coming from and you have to live with it forever you just want to do what you poop i want

1062
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:51,600
to poop poop on you want to poop poop on commenters you go do that commenters are pooping i poop on

1063
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:57,200
them okay look commenters are pooping i poop on them comment there the chest pooping is yeah

1064
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,720
like uh because like that uh that one right at moderator from a couple episodes ago whatever you

1065
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,200
one thing i told him was don't try to represent some sort of objective standard all you got to do

1066
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,760
to get our attention to get my attention to make a comment that will leave an impact on me is just

1067
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,960
say such and such bothers me and then i can decide whether or not to take that seriously like yeah

1068
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,040
everything that pisses me off almost all the piss i've ever had towards comments is that

1069
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,120
pretense that you represent something that you don't that's all i want that and i think you're

1070
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,720
totally right the only problem is that is that people who are all into collectivism and shit

1071
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:37,680
and feeling offended for other things they take personal offense from being other people being

1072
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,800
offended so they are well my god there's just no winning there's no way to win that fight i think

1073
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:49,200
well i mean when it comes to words and stuff yeah but that doesn't apply to like oh you didn't

1074
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:55,040
structure your review correctly you know they're inventing something imaginary like who are you

1075
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,320
who are these fucking people saying you didn't structure have you ever made a fucking video

1076
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,240
do you know what it's like to be on youtube god these these fucking backseat youtubers

1077
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:07,280
there's nothing worse than them those people need to fucking burn i like that term no like

1078
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:13,680
if someone says this video is offensive then the only response you need to make is maybe for you

1079
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,640
but it's not offensive and my god like it's not offensive for the people who liked it who and

1080
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:23,840
that's who i made it for i didn't make it for you offending someone like a bannable offense like

1081
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,960
this is the real world we're living in if an idea offends you you can say that that's fine right

1082
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,920
that doesn't make it objectively wrong some things are offensive it all comes back once again into

1083
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:39,040
and right offense is always it all comes back again into what do what not knowing what we want out

1084
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,840
of our videos right again if you're leaving a comment saying you did this wrong you really

1085
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:51,120
don't know what we were intending to do maybe i wanted to offend you maybe i just didn't think

1086
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:57,280
it was offensive maybe in my culture being offended by that thing i said is offensive to me

1087
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:03,040
like sometimes sometimes the things that offend other people i am offended that it offends them

1088
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:09,040
that is a thing i have experienced right so like yeah circular triggering is a real thing folks

1089
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:15,520
right and once again you don't need to leave your offended comment on my video it's not my job to

1090
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,560
give you that platform you have everywhere on the internet too now i understand that because my

1091
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,360
comments are open you probably will leave the comment on my video but guess what i'm going to

1092
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:30,400
delete it because i have the power to do that don't want your comment deleted leave it somewhere else

1093
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,960
go on twitter and talk about that makes comments suck is i think you know they get frustrated

1094
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,360
because they know something pissed them off and i think it comes from the futility that they feel

1095
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,200
that this guy's not going to read my comment i'm wasting my time this guy's just gonna say what he

1096
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,760
says in his own bubble and he's never gonna even hear me out and that frustration makes their comment

1097
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,720
more bitchy right so here's another rule assume that they're going to read the comments because

1098
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:58,480
unless they get hundreds of thousands of views on every video yeah they probably actually at least

1099
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,400
skim all the comments you don't people don't underestimate how much youtubers read their

1100
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,800
comments most of the time and the real the thing is that that because they get pissed off they don't

1101
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,040
want to put in the effort to read the other comments to see if that correction's already been made

1102
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:16,000
they they go into base things like using short sentences they go into all the other problems

1103
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,200
that we just talked about because of that frustration that feeling that it's going to be

1104
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,200
thrown in the garbage anyway well you know what that's the wrong way of looking at it look at it

1105
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,760
like it will get thrown in the garbage unless you calm down and try to say something insightful

1106
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,000
because our whole careers here on youtube is about saying things that are insightful

1107
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,200
even if it is very critical and that's what i'll say this like i you know i've made it sound like

1108
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:42,080
i delete fucking comments all the time and i do but most of the comments i delete are the ones that

1109
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,320
that have no recourse where it's just like fuck you you're a piece of shit and i just delete that

1110
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,520
guy and ban that guy you know and also meaningful statement i also will say that like a lot of my

1111
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:58,080
bands are based on if a lot of my bands aren't because of criticism per se they're because

1112
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:03,120
someone either admitted that they downvoted the video or admitted that they unsubscribe oh yeah

1113
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:07,040
that's another thing don't pretend to have some sort of some sort of affection for me when they're

1114
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:11,760
like i unsubscribe really i've never seen any of your comments on any of my other videos oh right

1115
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,480
you unsubscribe on my roller coaster three video a video i posted almost a year ago what kind of

1116
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,280
subscriber are you taking so long to watch my damn videos i don't believe you for one second

1117
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:27,120
continuing what i was saying that i he's i don't what i don't usually ban is people who who are just

1118
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:31,280
like you know making an argument and i'll usually respond to them yeah and if they're being a dick

1119
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:36,480
this has happened countless times where someone will say something they'll leave a comment in a way

1120
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:41,840
that's kind of like an asshole and then i'll respond and then they will apologize

1121
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,880
because where are these people coming from i never get anyone apologizing i get it i never get

1122
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,360
apologies all the time i get it all the time no you know because i hate these posts well the

1123
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,000
view the difference is that you often respond to people being an asshole by being an asshole

1124
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:02,880
no no no no no no no i do it in ways that that can diffuse the situation what's going on with jesse

1125
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,640
over there listen i was slapping the microphone with my wiener context

1126
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,400
no that's constructive commentary the vast majority of the comments i got on my big videos

1127
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,480
have been like ways to diffuse it but it doesn't work so i'm not gonna i'm not i've

1128
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:22,240
haven't been an asshole in return although i will i am open to the idea that maybe there's

1129
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:26,480
a diffusal technique that i need to learn do you know what i mean whenever someone apologizes please

1130
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,800
link me that comment so i can learn how you do it i will i will next time it happens but i get a

1131
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,960
lot of those were just someone responds in a way where they're like they disagree with the video but

1132
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,320
they phrase it in a really douchey way and i'll usually respond like well my intention was this

1133
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,800
and this is what i was trying to communicate yeah i've done that and i and most of the time they

1134
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:51,280
just don't reply i never get i never have gotten a single call the worst the worst the worst fucking

1135
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,760
response is when someone will be a complete dick and just try and like shut you down and then you

1136
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,840
respond and like just annihilate their argument like calm down bro it's just kidding

1137
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:07,840
if you say anything to someone with even a little bit of edge or if you use it like

1138
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,640
a swear word suddenly you're automatically in the wrong because you got angry well mother fucker

1139
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:17,040
if you're saying stupid bullshit on my video yes i am angry i have a right to be where the

1140
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,520
comment and i'm just getting where the fuck they want yeah just remember that guy on you um

1141
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,600
you're the content creator you're supposed to be the bigger person and i know tom that's

1142
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,760
infuriating it's fucking bullshit this guy started i'm not going to read the whole comment

1143
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,520
but he's like i tend to agree with your point yada yada i think you missed his opportunity yada yada

1144
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:38,400
and so then you respond um going you just respond like i went off on that motherfucker

1145
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:45,040
i fucking burned him at the stake you at the end and so his reply is wow period okay period oh god

1146
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:51,680
no never say yeah wow yeah and he even goes he even goes i'm even at the end he goes i'm a fan

1147
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:57,680
and i'm not unsubscribing because i like your content but when a fan when a fan he says they

1148
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:03,520
like your stuff and then tells you who who are you think you have a fucking opinion that's worth

1149
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:09,040
anything you're nothing you're worthless i here's oh no you're gonna unsubscribe guess what five

1150
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,760
fucking people just replace you subscribe he's saying guys i could unsubscribe but i've decided

1151
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,120
have mercy on you i'm gonna be very generous and not unsubscribe oh well he's not merciful what a

1152
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,840
good i went off on that motherfucker and i hope he has cancer you know what you know what that is

1153
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:29,040
when someone went when he said like wow period okay period you know what that is it's the internet

1154
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,080
equivalent of when somebody starts a fight gets their ass kicked and then stands up and goes come

1155
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:38,320
on pussy come on i'm still going i still want to fight i'm telling you i'm telling you if anyone

1156
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:43,280
ever fucking does that to me you are never getting invited back to gurren lagoon you're never

1157
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:50,400
never guys i gotta i gotta make this i want to make this comparison all right because the thing

1158
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,400
about the internet and the reason that people feel so entitled to say this shit is that it's so

1159
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,400
abstracted right right exactly we're all we're all far apart from each other we're all on our own

1160
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:04,480
screens you don't visualize it as people being there but the thing is that when i post a video

1161
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:10,960
and 2000 views get onto it in 30 minutes that means that basically everyone's in the same place

1162
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,640
we're all doing the same thing we're all at our computer we're all watching the same video we're

1163
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:20,080
all there and i'm standing there like when i post a video imagine this is the exact scenario that i

1164
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,440
think it's comparable to you know when there's those movie screenings where the director is there

1165
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:30,560
where the director like like will will be will will they'll show the movie the director's there at

1166
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:36,720
the end he might do like a q&a or something right and that's typically like how these these work

1167
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:42,480
i post a video and i'm sitting there on youtube after i like it's not like i post a video and

1168
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:48,960
then i disappear you know i don't fucking i don't post my video and then immediately go on a globetrotting

1169
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:54,400
adventure or something like that's not what happens i post it and then i sit there for two hours

1170
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:01,120
and read and respond to comments as they come and imagine when i when i when i post up a video

1171
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,600
and then i see comments coming onto the video before the runtime of the video is over that's what

1172
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,720
all starts to go downhill imagine yourself in a theater that that theater situation where the

1173
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:20,400
director is there and people are standing up and shouting first while watching the movie you would

1174
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:25,040
so deeply offend that direct they would kick you out of the theater first of all you would immediately

1175
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:31,040
be removed from the video because the venue itself has rules about this right the no one would comment

1176
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:36,880
before the movie was over once the director came out nobody would say you fucking suck you'd get

1177
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:42,240
kicked out you would get banned you would get blocked if the director comes out people stand up

1178
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:46,880
they give a round of applause even if you didn't like the movie stay sitting down don't say anything

1179
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:52,320
don't fucking you know or leave get up and leave because you the movie obviously didn't

1180
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:57,040
resonate with you you it wasn't for you it was for those people who were standing up clapping

1181
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,960
that's the like bar when the movie ends and everybody stands up and claps that's the like bar

1182
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:08,160
on the video yeah this the dislike bar is shouldn't even exist really because it i mean i i like the

1183
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:13,440
dislike bar only for when it's showing a mass dissatisfaction with something yeah i think it

1184
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:18,560
can be yeah yeah i'm with you on this point i i do agree that there's there's something definitely

1185
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,360
to be said about uh the environment you're in and the types of comments that are made but i guess

1186
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:29,200
it's just i i this is a totally separate point now but i really think it's important to have a place

1187
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:34,320
where you can just fucking vent and that's why i love 4chan so much but that yeah that's why 4chan's

1188
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:39,840
there though you could go on 4chan and do that i would love it if every time someone got mad about

1189
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:45,040
my video they went and complained about it on 4chan yeah not in my fucking comments because

1190
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,200
again to bring it back to that movie scenario if the director is standing there on the front of the

1191
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:53,760
stage and someone has it like let's say there was a rape scene in the movie yeah and someone gets up

1192
01:43:53,760 --> 01:44:00,160
and they say like like this would be an appropriate response you'd expect at a theater uh that rape

1193
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:05,280
scene made me a little bit uncomfortable so i'm curious as to why you put it in there what was

1194
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,400
your intentions with showcasing that were you trying to offend or did you have like what was

1195
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,080
your intent what was the message you were trying to communicate and then once the director tells you

1196
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,200
what message he was trying to communicate you can decide in your head well i don't agree with the way

1197
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,920
he presented it you don't have to you don't even have to say anything you can just know that in your

1198
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:31,040
mind right if you got up in that theater and you said how dare you depict rape the way you did

1199
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,840
then the director is gonna say fuck off i get out of my theater you know this is what i'm saying

1200
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,680
like people because of the abstraction of the internet they don't think of it this way but this

1201
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:45,600
is exactly what it is i am there i am the director of the video i am listening to your comments and

1202
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:51,680
when you come out screaming that is no socially different from standing up in the theater and

1203
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:56,400
yelling at the i think it's a little different but i hear what you're saying okay here's here's

1204
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:02,160
something kind of semi-related based on that is something that really drives me crazy is when

1205
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,480
because like we're talking about how people will comment and like you're sitting there especially

1206
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,520
in the beginning like reading the comments because like yeah you want to see what the reaction is to

1207
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:15,520
your work it drives me fucking crazy especially because i'm not a big channel when people will

1208
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,920
talk about me like i'm not there i prefer to be like in like a third person or just like

1209
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:25,040
talk amongst themselves does this yeah and it's just like i'm right here of this video

1210
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,920
that is yeah that brings me to another rule okay do not

1211
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:40,720
shit talk the video makers friends you idiots yeah this happens to all of us especially

1212
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:45,360
like there have been because and this happened to me and tom i think more than anybody else right

1213
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:50,320
where me and tom were both big in the pony community at a time and we would both cover

1214
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,880
every new episode of a show and me and tom were good friends and if you watched our content you

1215
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,920
would know that because we collaborated all the time we hung out we had all these interactions

1216
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:05,680
with each other and there would be people who would like comment on one of our videos about

1217
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:12,320
how shit the other guys was and like oh they would comment on tom's videos like tom i'm so glad

1218
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:16,960
that you're acting like this because digi lately it's just been a like a piece of shit like loser

1219
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:23,840
and i'm like i read tom's comments you're you're talking to me in front of my face this is happening

1220
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:30,800
to me so much digi on your top 10 youtuber youtube videos video yeah because you put me in both

1221
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,920
number two spots and so all these normies from your channel who didn't know about me you didn't

1222
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,240
like understand my content immediately had to spout off some opinion about it so you get all

1223
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:46,320
these people like this this one guy was like just use okay sometimes but i don't like he he seems

1224
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,440
like a bad but like totally misunderstanding my intent like the most obvious the most obviously

1225
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:57,280
stupid one is when digi bro's channel was down briefly and then uh on the gibbentake channel

1226
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:03,200
hippo oh yeah and people like oh fuck digi and fuck digi and it's like how could anyone who follows

1227
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:08,240
the gibbentake channel possibly like know about digi but also not realize that they're friends

1228
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:12,640
well like i remember that time i think digi could possibly be we're saying like really dismissive

1229
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:18,960
things like right yeah this guy looks dumb you know like even though digi just got done

1230
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:25,040
explaining to you why i like succeeded in like breaking the boundaries or like transcending

1231
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,360
whatever the fuck i was doing and like he says like it's not forever but he tells you why the video

1232
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,720
was good and why you should give it a chance and they're still being dismissive about it and then

1233
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:36,560
like i gotta do like a whole big thing with these two dipshit commenters on digi's videos

1234
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:43,520
and this one guy he kept like he kept saying the word brony at me as though it were an insult

1235
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,080
like uh you used to brony go back and review my the pony videos and it's like do you know

1236
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:54,240
who you're fucking subscribed to oh god that's the kind of calling me as though it's an insult

1237
01:47:54,240 --> 01:48:00,960
digi bro is the reason there is a brony fandom you dumb fuck well i guess no brony

1238
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:06,880
some people i would say that digi is 25 percent at least of why there is a persistent

1239
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:12,000
my little pony fandom something like that something like that i think yeah like did you

1240
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,480
made all these thirsty ass guys be like oh my god i can make money talking about fucking ponies on

1241
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:22,960
youtube i'm in which is exactly why i got into it too so and this is also like this is part of why

1242
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:28,320
i grew to eventually like really resent a lot of the other my little pony reviewers right right

1243
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:34,160
they never stuck up for it like like with me and tom when people would insult one of us

1244
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,840
we would stick up for each other we'd be like hey you know digi watches my videos or hey you know

1245
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:45,120
tom is my friend right you know like get the fuck out of here with that shit there's a lot of like

1246
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:50,160
all these pony youtubers who were all like directly inspired by me yeah they would get all these

1247
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:54,400
comments about how oh you're so much better than digi bro he's such a shit and they would never

1248
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:58,640
say anything about it they would never like uh they would never attack those people they'd never

1249
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:04,240
be like oh no they're thrown they want that thrown to empty it because they don't want to stick up for

1250
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:08,880
anyone least of all right friends or themselves and i'm like i'm like if i inspired you you should

1251
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:14,400
like okay imagine like like i've talked about a lot about ghost lightning right and how he inspired

1252
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,200
me to get into blogging if someone came into my video and was like man that ghost lightning guy

1253
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:24,320
his blog went so downhill i'm so glad that you you were such a good dude i'd be like get the fuck

1254
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:29,040
out of here because that guy is that guy is the entire reason i even do this because he inspired

1255
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:34,960
me and there's people who directly have like told me that i was the reason that they started doing

1256
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:39,120
youtube yeah and then they get comments that are like fuck digi bro and they don't say anything and

1257
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:44,960
i know why it's because it makes them feel good they feel good that they are getting praised over a

1258
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:51,280
famous guy over a guy who has more attention than they do so they're like oh you know even though i

1259
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:56,560
don't agree with this at least uh oh yeah i get to fuck you all right if you don't defend the fact that

1260
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:03,120
i inspired you to make your videos you exist because of me you fucking pieces of shit do not pull

1261
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:07,200
and i'm not saying this just to be arrogant for myself i feel this way about everyone who inspired

1262
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:12,880
me if someone throw them stone if someone fucking came to my video and was talking shit about any of

1263
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:17,120
the video make even uh you guys have seen how defensive i get of even ego raptor and i don't

1264
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,720
even think he's making good videos anymore but every time someone talks shit about ego raptor i'm

1265
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:24,320
like well i wouldn't be here if not for you always dependent when i talk about game grunts you're

1266
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:28,960
always there digi haters when you guys channeled lead it i was on that equestria daily thread

1267
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:35,040
responding to all my god i i got banned from equestria daily banned from equestria daily uh

1268
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:40,880
oh what a for love for for like being too correct i wasn't even being angry at them now you know i

1269
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,240
think that's another theory i have as to why people put up with that kind of hatred it's because a

1270
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:49,040
lot of people don't mind all of the hateful comments as much in general this brings me to the most

1271
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:55,600
offensive but most like possibly the most impactful point i'm gonna make is i think a lot of people

1272
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,520
listening to this who maybe even have a little bit of content themselves and they they're listening

1273
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,280
to our complaints and they're like yeah you know you guys make a bunch of good points but negative

1274
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:07,280
comments still don't bother me that much and i don't really relate to your guys's opinions well i have

1275
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,640
your own throat motherfucker because i'm more important than you and they bother me

1276
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,760
well you know that's kind of what i'm about to say you see he's gonna say it's an issue of scale

1277
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:21,040
right well no no it's because it used to be because i've been on the internet forever right

1278
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:27,280
ever since it was invented in 1937 and yeah uh and i would make stuff i would throw stuff out there

1279
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,440
and i didn't really have a whole lot of passion i i i wanted to do something but i didn't have a

1280
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,840
clear goal a clear motivation then there wasn't anything that i ever like really poured my soul

1281
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:40,880
into and if someone criticized it i was like you know i don't really care it was only when i started

1282
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:45,280
really caring about the stuff that i was making uh that you know it started to really get under my

1283
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:50,000
skin more you know people misinterpreting your intentions is more offensive when you have more

1284
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,720
intentions so i just want people to reflect on themselves about that that if you don't think

1285
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:59,280
that offensive comments are that offensive maybe it's because you're not very creative or very

1286
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:03,120
driven rather you know i know that's a really harsh point to make but i think it's probably very

1287
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:09,680
fucking true because like i'm i'm working on like i still do reviews on on on my first channel

1288
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:13,040
but i mean i don't really care too much anymore it's just i'm doing it because like there are

1289
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,440
occasionally topics that i like talking about and that's how i make money and so like when people

1290
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:21,040
like blew up on the video i made yesterday like i knew it was gonna incite shit i didn't care it was

1291
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:25,520
just like a dumb thing i wanted to do and like whatever but you know when when there's projects

1292
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,680
that i like i legitimately care about i'm way more defensive about it i mean that's why i'm like

1293
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,840
stalling trying to make this motion comment because like my like soul is in this project

1294
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,840
and like i'm going to be using it to like examine a bunch of like my own commenters can't relate to

1295
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,480
that because they don't have souls right it's they're not real human beings they're not really

1296
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,880
like that's when when they say shit like that it's way worse because like i remember i started doing

1297
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,440
some writing stuff like a couple years ago and like i was like really like putting my own stat

1298
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:55,760
and someone's like oh can i can i look at your work i want to i want to you know like i write

1299
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,440
stuff too i want to help you i'm like okay like yeah and like i've been i wrote like one thing

1300
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,960
like a week ago it's the first thing i ever wrote he just came back like this shit this is all

1301
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:08,000
shit is fucking awful like why are you even trying and like that's stung like shit because like he

1302
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,560
came in like trying to be helpful and then just like shit on it with like reckless abandon and yeah

1303
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:21,520
that's actually really clever and sinister like yeah if i really hated someone if somebody like

1304
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,520
left a shit comment and they had videos on their channel i would go to their channel and i'd be like

1305
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,040
hey can i do you mind if i watch some videos i think you have a lot of potential maybe i could

1306
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:35,280
watch your videos and i would wait for like a week and i'd come back and i'd fucking destroy

1307
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:40,160
every single fucking thing about their lives and they would die the worst thing that ever happened

1308
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:46,160
to me with with something like that is like there was this guy who was my biggest patron for a year

1309
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:52,960
and a half he would give me a hundred dollars of video wow and and and he did that for like a year

1310
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,920
and a half and it took me a year and a half to realize he actually hated me and was trying to

1311
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,680
like make me depressed and he gave me like a thousand dollars yeah like and we it eventually

1312
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:09,120
boiled down to this huge fucking argument whoa um when okay that guy is actually psychotic

1313
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:16,320
wow he is dude that's insane he got you tom he he gave you a thousand dollars he sure he sure got

1314
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:23,200
you man hey hey what do you say in this final confrontation go to patreon.com by all means if

1315
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:29,120
you think i'm the worst guy ever please patreon.com slash did you direct all hate comments to the

1316
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:35,440
patreon exclusive section you will ruin my life all right what did he say what was his argument at

1317
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:39,760
the end of that there was this posse of kids who like hung around me and like laughed at every stupid

1318
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,440
joke i made and other kids were like dude they're just mocking you who cares there's this group of

1319
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,680
people around here who pretend to love me it's great i don't feel offended at all that's like

1320
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:53,920
the internet equivalent of wimp low like they trained him wrong as a joke yeah yeah money is gonna

1321
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:59,680
destroy you yeah by the way if you want a little money no problems right make make comments like i

1322
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:04,800
love you your videos are amazing those are always good yeah right those comments are always nice i

1323
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:12,160
like well sometimes just just like uh yeah um oh shit i forgot what i was gonna say could you

1324
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:16,800
say your thing yeah tom what what happened at the end of that i mean it was it was like what happened

1325
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,720
is he gave me a bunch of money for a while then stopped and then we were friends did we just continue

1326
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:26,800
like at that point it like sharply declined in terms of like being friendly but at that point i

1327
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:31,280
assumed he was my friend because it's been like almost a year and it just like constant prodding

1328
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:35,600
because like he knew that i'd like you know like i'm i'm i'd have like intermittent depression

1329
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:40,000
and stuff and he would play off of that and like just like say a bunch of shit and like do a bunch

1330
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:46,560
of things what is this guy a pickup artist trying to get in your pants is he negging you hey there's

1331
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:51,360
nothing wrong with being a sociopath pickup artist it's the right way to live let's not let's not

1332
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:56,560
throw stones at that you know it's it's funny what davu was saying and i guess his ultimate point

1333
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:01,120
was like if you're passionate then it matters more and i guess i've always been passionate but like

1334
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:06,640
i back in the day got even more mad at like negative comments than i do now like i've never

1335
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:12,880
never been able to take criticism i've always been passionate i've not always been confident

1336
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,760
there wasn't always individual pieces of art that i put a lot of work into and thought were good

1337
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,320
i don't i don't have the ability to delusionally think my content is better than it is you know

1338
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:27,280
it's it's almost funny because before i started on youtube i didn't really have a response to

1339
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,600
everything anyone would say at me i do now people can say anything they want about me and i'll

1340
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:35,200
have i don't know like a bunch of shit i can regurgitate that of and it's always correct you

1341
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:39,280
know it's funny how it's always correct i don't even plan that it just happens that way anyway this

1342
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,280
is going on really long does anybody have any we should we should list any more points we have

1343
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:47,040
i still have a few i still have a few that okay let's let's get to those let's get to that well

1344
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:51,040
people who think that they're being cute or endearing by insulting me you're not you don't

1345
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:55,760
know me like that you're not my fucking friend you don't get to insult me um let's see uh comments

1346
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:02,080
about my appearance uh uh okay always irrelevant always a little bit hurtful and you would never

1347
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,400
fucking say it to my face or you i would strangle you and kill you so don't fucking say it on the

1348
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,960
internet because you wouldn't say it i gotta jump in on that too man because again obviously i get

1349
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,840
it all the fucking time with the beard and like here's the like okay sometimes people joke about

1350
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:21,680
the beard and sometimes it can be funny and i don't i don't mind being like kind of a meme

1351
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:25,760
you know like on some level like kind of like anthony fantano he's bald and people call him a

1352
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:30,800
melon and it's funny and he's in on the joke and he clearly appreciates that joke because it came

1353
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:36,560
from a funny place where it was like someone some artist he reviewed like negatively like legitimately

1354
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:40,960
called him a melon as it like like i'm all angry at him yeah and so people picked up on that and

1355
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,880
started calling him that and it's funny and he likes it and there's certain memes and stuff

1356
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:50,160
that are that can be fun obviously i look like a fucking weirdo i appreciate that and himself

1357
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:57,760
aware of it and like and it can be funny to talk about but like if all you have to say is like uh

1358
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:03,040
shave your face it's like dude i don't belong to you i am not i'm not here to look how you want

1359
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:08,560
me to look if i was i wouldn't look like i i don't understand how people seem to think that

1360
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:13,840
youtubers are so unself aware like we talk this this kind of goes back to the authorial intent

1361
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:18,640
thing where i was saying that like people watch your videos and they somehow think that you don't

1362
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:26,240
know what's in them you know like i'm a guy who writes intensely deeply analytical content

1363
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:34,560
about shows i break down like visual aesthetics on a regular basis i know how i look you know

1364
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:40,640
well yeah i'm a writer uh like how do you not how do you not get what that i like i have to edit

1365
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:46,480
these videos i have to see myself on camera i know what my beard looks like i know what i look like

1366
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:52,480
and the reason that i haven't changed it is either obviously a i don't care or b i like the way i

1367
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:57,520
look and there's people who say things like one recently that just pissed me off so much i couldn't

1368
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:01,760
stop thinking about it this this happens to be a lot so some people know how to phrase a comment

1369
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:08,240
in just such a way that i that i just like i can't believe that they said it yeah and like and it

1370
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:13,440
just burrows into my brain all day and based on the phrasing like if it gets to a nine out of ten

1371
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:18,240
on the smug scale i ban it's like i'm gonna go i said on my on my on my final fantasy seven video

1372
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:23,680
from like a year ago now or something yeah like i got so many like oh this guy he's just he's got

1373
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:29,360
this big beard and he's got a hawaiian shirt i don't accidentally have a big beard in a hawaiian

1374
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:34,720
shirt in that video i grew it because i wanted it and i put the shirt on because it looks cool

1375
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:41,760
fuck you the comment that got to me so much though that was recent was like someone saying

1376
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:48,480
i don't understand how he thinks that beard looks good he he should like beards are meant to be

1377
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:53,920
taken care of they're not meant to just be grown have had god you're violating beard was all i could

1378
01:59:53,920 --> 02:00:03,520
think was why does he think that i grew this to look good why would like is that what we assume

1379
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:08,080
everyone everyone's completely obsessed with their appearance and all they care about is looking

1380
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:12,640
perfect at all times let me jump in real quick right there because i have a 10 out of 10 perfect

1381
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:17,120
specimen of a man and the only comments i get on my appearance are to say how beautiful i am so you

1382
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:22,960
made a video yeah where you deliberately looked shitty that's true for the message of the video

1383
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,320
and i remember when i clicked on it when i clicked on growing the gun part one you said to me

1384
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:30,480
name why you look like such a fucking scrub in this video right the very first thing i thought

1385
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:34,480
was like what the fuck why is he look because i i remember i know what you look like i'd met you

1386
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:40,000
and i was like did he like completely go downhill in the time since i last saw him and then the video

1387
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,600
turns out is about you transforming and and i didn't leave that comment because i finished the video

1388
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:50,400
and then i told you that i had thought that at first and then i and then later in the video it

1389
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,560
was proven see yours he's applying several of the rules that we've educated you on in this thing

1390
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,120
and i completely didn't see it coming yeah it was just like i saw you as like a nerd and then you

1391
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:03,200
you evolved and i was like oh that's fucking genius because i was thinking about how shitty you

1392
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:09,280
looked and now you look amazing and it's awesome like that's sometimes the point like i like that

1393
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:15,760
i am this character who is this like weird crazy hobo who lives in a dungeon of anime posters

1394
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,320
it's hilarious to me and if you watch my after dark channel that that comes through more because

1395
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:26,400
i wear the sunglasses and do weird shit you know like like it's it's obvious but like that's why

1396
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:33,360
i said comments about the beard will be deleted because like i i know i know everything you can

1397
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:38,080
say about it i know what it looks like the reason the beard looks so shitty on camera by the way

1398
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:42,880
is usually because if you actually saw it it yeah it's usually because of the lighting because

1399
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,960
in order to make your face appear on camera when you're filming in the middle of the night

1400
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,920
you have to light yourself really well and when all that light goes through all the the scraggly

1401
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:58,240
part of my beard it looks really bad if you saw me in person it never looks like that it looks way

1402
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:04,400
more full it looks completely together because i don't have a fucking halogen light blasting on me

1403
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:09,840
when i'm when i'm doing it you know and people like people don't get that that you can film from

1404
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,040
different angles and different lightings and everything makes it look different everything

1405
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:17,440
will everything you do will make you look completely different and there's some videos that i've posted

1406
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:22,240
where people will be like oh man you look like you lost weight and you look like uh like you

1407
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:26,800
like you cleaned yourself up and literally all i did was wear a tighter shirt and film from a

1408
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:32,240
downward angle with better lighting like right sometimes i don't have time to set all that up

1409
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:39,440
you know and it's like i i wish people understood why i look the way i do but like all i can assure

1410
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:45,040
you is that i know i know exactly what i look like in the video i edited it half of my career

1411
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:49,360
is analyzing aesthetics it's interesting digi i'm learning something about the differences between

1412
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:56,080
you and i because i'm the kind of guy who takes six months to make a video that will in no way

1413
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:00,800
be worth the effort that's expanded on it to make sure i get all those little details perfect

1414
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:05,280
whereas you take the obviously superior approach of being like well i'm not going to fucking put

1415
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:10,000
the time in to get this done that's retarded no one in the world to do that there's no way i can

1416
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,920
it's completely impractical videos that i do because like i i i have ideas for videos constantly

1417
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:22,320
you know and sometimes there's like with that whole the video that was uh that was positive

1418
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:27,120
reviews like here's positive reviews i've done the the only incentive for that video was not to

1419
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:33,520
make a good video it was to make one at that moment right because i was about to make two very negative

1420
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:38,320
reviews about very popular shows right after people have been saying that i've been getting

1421
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:42,880
really negative with my videos and my most recent popular ones were negative videos so i thought

1422
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,520
let's counterbalance this and draw attention to positive videos i've made it wouldn't have worked

1423
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:52,400
if i posted it two weeks later it would have no point because i would already be done with the

1424
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:58,400
negative videos and moving on so like the only incentive was how can i get a video out tonight

1425
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,720
that proves that i've that i've made positive videos i don't have victor available to light me

1426
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:07,680
well or shoot me with a nice camera because he's been working for all fucking week i don't have

1427
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,360
i don't want to show off too much of my room because i'm planning to use parts of my room

1428
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:16,800
for a different video and i don't want it to be shown before then i can't necessarily set up

1429
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:22,560
everything to look good so let's just fucking turn on the camera and ramble and if i'm if i'm lucky

1430
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:28,640
if if my fans are are fucking decent enough people then when i nicely ask them not to

1431
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:35,200
fucking talk about my beard maybe they won't do it how wrong ever was i maybe all right jesse we're

1432
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:41,840
let's let's move on to some of these other points okay i've been wanting to say this this whole

1433
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,560
damn podcast oh hey you know i can be able to spend a little bit more i have a really minor

1434
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:53,360
point that'll take one minute you shut your fucking face god damn it you people you can go after me

1435
02:04:54,320 --> 02:05:01,840
you people out there do not ever ever

1436
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:16,080
use my full name or my real name ever don't do it you're not my friends you're not a person in

1437
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:21,120
my life you don't know me like that my name is endless jess that's the name of my channel you

1438
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:25,280
can call me that or one of my other 10 000 monikers you can call me drowning in footwear you

1439
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:30,800
can call me the fucking horseshoe boy you can call me whatever the hell you want but jesse wood is for

1440
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:37,360
my fucking friends jesse is for my friends and i can't even describe why exactly it makes my skin

1441
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:42,720
crawl so much it feels like a violation it feels like rape like somebody is in my kitchen touching

1442
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:49,760
my shit or messing around with my stuff it feels dirty don't do it do not call me by my real name

1443
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:55,680
don't ever ever fucking do it jesse ever i i agree with you and i think that i think that it's

1444
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:01,360
with in your case it's a little bit your fault and a lot our fault yeah yeah we're definitely

1445
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:05,920
culpable because we always because we all called you jessie wood no one name to right seriously

1446
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:11,280
have the entire umbrella even if it's a positive comment or a nice comment if you use my real name

1447
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,920
i feel i feel raped and i don't respect you as a person and i don't like for the record jess

1448
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:19,920
you have you like well i don't know if you did it in any of the videos that are still available

1449
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,160
well yeah because when i started out i stupidly didn't know what i wanted to call myself yet yeah

1450
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:29,440
a man makes mistakes you know in the in the uh the manly lessons to manhood video you're like

1451
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:34,640
i'm jesse wood which is part of why that video doesn't exist anymore right but like yeah i but i

1452
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:38,480
completely get where you're coming from because like well your username is i think the reason

1453
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:43,200
that it happens with you is that a your old usernames were all difficult to use as names and

1454
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:47,440
your you new username is so close to your real name that people just assume that that's just

1455
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,320
what to use and sometimes we mean we want to describe like you as a person as distinct from all

1456
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:57,360
the different subsets of you that exist it's like it's hard to describe but i i think endless jess

1457
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,520
i think endless jessum rellis them all pretty well yeah which is why i've started calling you

1458
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:05,840
i'm like a hannard people from mass effect okay i got my face name and that's republic

1459
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:10,400
and i got my soul name and that's for my peeps and you ain't my reason i agree with you though

1460
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,880
is that i get this sometimes where there's certain people who call me i don't even fucking call

1461
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:21,120
you conrad i can't do it right it was weird no dude it's super weird to me because never

1462
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:27,840
have i put out there that it was that i am conrad it's my you guys are my closest friends online

1463
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:33,600
you all call me digi everyone online calls me digi my name is always digi bro it always is

1464
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:37,920
there's never not the case when people but here's the thing here's why it bothers me because when

1465
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:42,720
people call me conrad especially like with jessie i get that maybe they don't understand that you

1466
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:48,400
don't like to be called that but with conrad 100 of the time it feels like they're trying to be sneaky

1467
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:54,960
it feels like they're trying to say i know more about you and i'm like oh i i'm closer to the

1468
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:59,360
truth creepy sentiment that i've looked into you yeah right because like you only would know that

1469
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:04,320
if you were watching like either watching like interviews or something or you saw me in like a

1470
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,800
google hangout because my real name is on my google plus account so like you saw me in a google

1471
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,120
hangout and you saw that it was conrad or you saw my facebook or something you saw or you listen to

1472
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:18,960
this podcast well yeah or yeah this particular podcast is only or and i i'm a little bit more

1473
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:24,000
forgiving when it's on digi bros because of the fact that you called your name there yeah right

1474
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,160
like me and victor will be on there and victor will call me conrad that's like i think context

1475
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:32,240
it was ego raptor then it became erin because everyone right like everyone calls him erin now

1476
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:37,520
because it it became normal and like i'm more okay with people calling me conrad in the comments

1477
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:42,080
of digi bros because i'm like yeah okay i get called conrad here all the time and like and it

1478
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,840
doesn't feel sneaky it's never felt like they're trying to say it's sneaky because like that's

1479
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,440
like one of the things that that guy was talking about earlier did because at one point when we

1480
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:54,240
were still like he's still being chummy he bought something off of me so i sent it to him and then

1481
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:59,440
he would start calling me by my real name in all of my comments and then he would mention my hometown

1482
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:06,560
all the time where i live oh hey it's on balan of michigan whatever there is an issue of context

1483
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,520
to it i guess because yeah on digi bros your conrad because it's you and your brother and i get why

1484
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,720
they'd call you that or like for me like if i went and did like stand up or i released a stand-up cd

1485
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:21,040
i don't know if i'd call myself endless jess on stage i might or i might just let them call me

1486
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:25,600
jessie would if in that case maybe but when i'm on my fucking youtube channel it's like my wrestler

1487
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:29,840
name okay you don't walk up to see him punk and say hey phil you just don't do it he'll punch you

1488
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,560
he'll beat you up and i'll beat you up i'll beat up everyone again yeah and and with someone like

1489
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:39,120
cn punk that would absolutely be trying to be sneaky you're trying to be cheeky you're trying to say

1490
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:44,080
i know more about you you know what other people i got i'm an insider i've got a funny thing here

1491
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:49,680
it's just um i i my name nat is out there a little bit some people have called me that sometimes uh

1492
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:54,320
they're calling me guy these days which is fine but when people bring up the name keg standard

1493
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:59,920
it's like bro you need to knock that shit off we've all moved on from those days let's just

1494
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,720
let's just move it along you can only have it you can only call him mate if you spell it n eight

1495
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:10,080
that's right and you know i a keg standard isn't even me you know that's not me that was true that

1496
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,760
that is this pony man my best friend no guys that yes his own that story when you call me conrad

1497
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:20,960
it doesn't like what you're trying to say is i know more about you than other people but what

1498
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:25,520
in like and i'm going to rape you is implied but yeah what it comes off to me is like creepy

1499
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:31,120
and weird because you know that my other friends online call me digi and they're i like i like it

1500
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:38,640
when i can tell why people know me by what they call me we're like in in my house everyone calls

1501
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:45,040
me conrad but when i hear people call me digi it lets me know oh you know me from youtube you know

1502
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:49,680
me from my life you know if my friend fucking trevor comments on my videos and says conrad you

1503
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:55,760
piece of shit then that's okay because it's trevor and he he's uh you know like someone who knows me

1504
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:00,560
as conrad but like when i go to conventions and someone walks up to me and goes hey digi i can

1505
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:05,600
go okay this guy watches my channel that's why he knows who i am you know and that makes it a lot

1506
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:10,480
easier for me to like contextualize how people know me if you walked up to me at a convention and

1507
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:15,120
i didn't know who you were and you said hey conrad i'm gonna assume that we went to high school

1508
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:19,520
together or something like i'm gonna be trying to figure out why do i know you don't do that shit

1509
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:24,480
folks it's a matter of respect that's what it is jesse you got another i think that was actually one

1510
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:29,040
time that somebody called me by my real yeah online sometime there's only one maybe they were just

1511
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:35,360
talking about that one luxury brand louis of dawn yes which is gives real name all right jesse

1512
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:40,800
next one well davoo had one oh he did yeah okay blame yourself if they get mad don't think don't

1513
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:47,280
psychoanalyze them to think that the youtuber is having a psychoanalysis yeah yeah i got that

1514
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:52,480
string of emails for like a week from that guy who's trying to psychoanalyze me in my inbox oh yeah

1515
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:58,720
yeah oh yeah i remember that that was amazing right because i remember that guy didn't he have a

1516
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:04,480
really fandom as i recall yeah didn't he have a really edgy uh profile yeah he did he did it was

1517
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:09,360
awesome that guy was just like it was like these long unbroken paragraphs that guy was a walking

1518
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:16,240
fedora me breaks that were just that were just him going like tom the way you've left the fandom

1519
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:21,280
proves that you you're just uh you've you've grown more distant and sensitive as a person

1520
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:28,880
oh man that was amazing like even professional ecologists you can fire them and not let them

1521
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:33,600
constantly right well what's your escape from these people there is nothing so so that commenter guy

1522
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:39,040
who i was reading from before who was commenting on jesse he made another one he said your words

1523
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:45,920
sound like those of a hurt person oh yeah i remember that one and i don't think my and get this oh

1524
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,880
and i don't this is like the most egregious of this particular thing ever yeah and i don't think

1525
02:12:51,920 --> 02:13:02,000
i don't think my words are the thing that hurt you oh god shut up i think i think i think you're

1526
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:08,640
responding to something or someone else with your bitter words i'm sorry jess and i wish you the best

1527
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:14,640
and you know and you know after i dane after i dane to lower myself and do him the favor of

1528
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:19,600
explaining to him in seven paragraphs why he's a fucking piece of shit he still has the nerve to

1529
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:25,040
not even take any of it in and just reject all of it with some bullshit psycho analysis to try to

1530
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:29,520
cop out of it and back out with his tail tucked between his legs he's a coward they're all fucking

1531
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,400
cowards who don't want to accept what that is when they've made a mistake that's intellectual

1532
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,320
cowardice he's looking for any excuse to not accept the argument so that's that's what that is

1533
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:42,160
whether he can't or he just won't that's what it is and i'll okay jesse beat him up next one um

1534
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:47,760
okay i uh i don't have any much more rules written down but i want to talk about one

1535
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:55,040
commenter specifically from a recent episode of this podcast and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go

1536
02:13:55,040 --> 02:14:00,720
off on them but i'm gonna illustrate a couple of things we talked about so it was during the

1537
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:06,560
dark souls race and i was making my anita sulkeesian jokes my legendary hilarious anita sulkeesian

1538
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:11,680
jokes right the the most important character jesse's ever created yeah and and some guy was like

1539
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:18,400
uh those jokes ruin the whole thing anita sulkeesian is not funny now i have two complaints with that

1540
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:24,160
sentiment the first complaint is first of all motherfucker i am the expert on funny i know it's

1541
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:28,880
funny and you don't and you can't say that something is not funny when everyone else in the call

1542
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:33,120
on the podcast was laughing uproariously at it the whole that's right that's pretty much defeats it

1543
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:37,440
right there but the but the second issue that i have with it is that it speaks to what we talked

1544
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:44,240
about early earlier with misunderstanding my intent this guy thought that anita sulkeesian

1545
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:49,520
was not funny because he was viewing the joke through the lens of well this guy's making fun of

1546
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,600
anita sarkeesian and he's making fun of social justice and that's been done to death and its

1547
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:58,000
old hat and i totally get that but it's a misunderstanding of my intent and my intent

1548
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,680
is what makes the joke funny because i'm not doing it to shit on social justice warriors

1549
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:07,600
i'm doing it because i have a fondness for anita sarkeesian i think she's hilarious it's true

1550
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:11,920
and and and my character anita sulkeesian first of all anita sulkeesian has been my dark souls

1551
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:17,360
character since 2011 she's been with me on these journeys the whole time i have more of an attachment

1552
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:21,440
to her than any other character i could have possibly made so it's not just me making fun of

1553
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:27,280
social justice warriors it's funny because she's my girl and she's just she exists in dark souls

1554
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:34,640
she hates men she is immune to poison and is fucking funny yeah i mean that the it's got nothing

1555
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:38,880
it's got nothing to do with me pushing any kind of agenda it's just a funny thing that i made like

1556
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:44,080
five years ago and i stuck with it because i like her anita sulkeesian video from the blue glow

1557
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:49,200
like if you haven't seen it it's amazing because i mean even if it was just a joke on social justice

1558
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:56,320
warriors what is the joke the joke is that she is immune to toxic which means that you actually

1559
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:02,880
made a character and put all of the stats into immunity so that you could run around a toxic

1560
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:09,040
environment and it wouldn't affect you and you have gone out of your way to make this makes the

1561
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:15,440
game harder killing all of the male in a race no less that's hilarious yeah in the middle of a race

1562
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:21,920
he went out of his way and still beat my time by the way by a landslide yeah he he still rang

1563
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:27,120
two bells before i rang one while taking time out of his day to murder all of the male npcs

1564
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:34,480
and then pose proudly after doing it that shit was hilarious the fact that it's anita sulkeesian

1565
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:39,600
is a very clever pun but the fact that it's a joke on her is not why it's funny it's a

1566
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:44,880
fucking well-delivered joke you did it perfectly and not appreciating that just because you're

1567
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:51,040
like you know but it's i'm sick of anita's yeah whatever dude it's funny that's why we laughed

1568
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:55,360
at it and the guy clearly didn't think about why it was like nobody he clearly just thought it was

1569
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:59,920
uh it's an anita nobody is more sick look at the crap nobody is more sick of that joke than me

1570
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:07,040
but the fact that i'm so sick of it makes it even funnier to me when i do it right yeah because

1571
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:13,200
yeah all right well well are we done have you wrapped it up i guess we've wrapped it up i could

1572
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:17,680
go all day on this topic we could go all day but people i've got an undertale video to finish

1573
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,840
it's coming what are these days i just want to say i'm just gonna end why i leave comment why

1574
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:28,640
i like comments because i don't even get this mysterious elusive discussion that digi always

1575
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:33,040
talks about i don't think anyone can really contribute much since i'm the one who put days

1576
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:38,160
into thinking about it you know um i don't almost never do i watch an analysis and have

1577
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:44,160
much else to add on to it myself i leave comments up because it helps me gauge the reaction of a

1578
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:49,600
video i want to know not only how many people decided to watch it but how many people had a

1579
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:53,440
some sort of verbal reaction to it right that's what i like and i just think that

1580
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:56,800
a comment that doesn't amuse me isn't very useful if it doesn't seem like it's going to

1581
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:01,040
amuse anyone else it does it's not worth existing you know and i'm making the world a better place

1582
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:05,760
by deleting it yeah i'm with you there i don't i don't only leave comments open just for like good

1583
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:12,320
discussion i like to me it it signifies that people are engaging with the content because like

1584
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:17,440
if all i had was views and all i had was likes i don't know what kind of views those are if a

1585
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:23,120
video gets a hundred thousand views and no comments then it's like did people even really care or

1586
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,360
engage with the content or people just like what were they thinking when they watched it so like

1587
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:32,720
the comments allow me to know that like yeah people are people give some level of a shit about what

1588
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:39,120
i just made you know and uh and so yeah no matter what the comments are it's nice when i get a lot

1589
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,520
of them and that's always a good like okay this is something that people really cared about or it

1590
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:47,920
resonated with them you know even with something like the erased video if i didn't have so many

1591
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:54,720
dumb comments having a bunch of negative ones at least tells me that the video was something that

1592
02:18:54,720 --> 02:19:00,480
inspired people to feel away you know like it gave them feelings whether they were positive or negative

1593
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:04,320
but when yeah those kind of comments let you know you know what people are wanting which you could

1594
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:08,560
throw that away if you want but at least it's information yeah it's the dirty side of it all

1595
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:12,720
your all your bitching does have an influence on us whether we do specifically what you said or

1596
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:18,800
not we never do specifically what you said but we at least with me i do it's a tangible detail right

1597
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:24,400
it is it is like i'm i've been making like people don't understand specifically around what people

1598
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:30,240
are going to misunderstand yeah a lot of people don't like they'll they'll say that they didn't

1599
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:37,360
like the video and then they'll try to explain why and it's probably like often it's not really that

1600
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:42,800
like they don't completely get what even like it's it's kind of like when the the film crit

1601
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:47,440
hold tangible details thing where he talked about how people will blame the hair color of the actor

1602
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:53,600
for the fact that the the performance wasn't good when if it's a good movie and they do a good

1603
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,920
performance then you'll accept a character even if they don't look like how you thought they were

1604
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,960
supposed to right like with with my videos sometimes like with the erased one i've gotten a

1605
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:08,400
lot of complaints that just kind of missed the point of what i was trying to do and like

1606
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:13,520
so they're not helpful they're not helpful that they're negative but constructive criticism is

1607
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:19,520
really rare remember that right but like you know there are times where i i will just look at the

1608
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:25,120
fact that no one got it and that can inform me now with that particular video i knew people

1609
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:29,280
weren't going to get it and i didn't care like i wanted that video to be what it was and i knew

1610
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:33,840
it would have a negative reaction but there have been times in the past like with my zanko no terror

1611
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:38,160
video which is kind of similar to that one where there was a lot of negative reaction to it that

1612
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:43,200
i didn't expect and it made me realize that i had written the video wrong not for the reasons

1613
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,720
necessarily that people responded to like people would say this and that and get mad at me but what

1614
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:53,280
i realized when i assessed like okay this video is making a lot of people mad why and then i realized

1615
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,040
why and i didn't do that anymore that's why you should talk only about your own opinions don't

1616
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:01,120
try to represent a fictional rule book because that will help us learn from your opinions

1617
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:05,680
faster that's a very good point okay let's wrap it up but before we go i oh given you want to say

1618
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:12,880
something yeah i was just gonna say um that uh my uh comments are uh the best by the way does

1619
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:17,360
leave the objectively best comments of anybody as you can see on his twitter if you follow not

1623
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:40,560
time it seems like they're just like it's not his hypocrite i'm giving take share hypocrite

1624
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:44,960
it doesn't offend people so long as you don't run a kickstarter you'll never get a contingent of

1625
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:50,560
haters that's that's true okay now before we go i have one announcement i want to make which is just
