1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
By the time I reached my teenage years, I was kind of a film snob and I went through a bit of an anti-Star Wars phase.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
Perhaps I felt it was a kid's thing and I grew out of it.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,320
But another thing that may have attributed to my brief disinterest in Star Wars was how

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,380
unoriginal the movies seem to me at the time. It's true that George Lucas was influenced by several films,

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,240
but that's only what makes the movies so great. The characters are all famous archetypes.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,160
Luke is the classic hero, Obi-Wan's the classic mentor, much like Frodo and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings, or

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
King Arthur and Myrtle from Sword and the Stone.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,840
But there's so much more to it. I've barely scratched the surface and it's not like nobody knows about this.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,320
There's a wealth of information on Star Wars influences all over the internet.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,000
But the fact that Star Wars takes old ideas and makes them into something new shows how ingenious it really is.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,600
It's not like it's plagiarizing. It's just that all ideas in general come from somewhere.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,920
It pays tribute to all these old movies, literature, folklore, mythology, and ultimately reflects our culture.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
The movies were a prime target for video game adaptations.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,840
They were full of all kinds of action set pieces, so how could I fuck that up?

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,920
So I know the Angry Video Game Nerd made a video about Castlevania 2's Simon's Quest and I love him and that video, but I'll give a f***

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,440
Number one, Game Feel! Number two, Day and Night! Number three, The Plot.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,200
So with all these complex elements left totally unexplained, George starts throwing the plot at us.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,720
You know those Star Wars reviews I'm ripping off?

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
Where the guy says that the prequel trilogy can never be on dog.

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm not telling you yet. I want to build some suspense first.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,840
We need to build up some suspense first.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Not yet. I want to build even more suspense.

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,440
No, not yet. Let's build some more suspense.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Kamino is the coolest guy. Period. He's just the coolest.

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,920
For me, a real man is one that never abandons his beliefs. That always sticks to his mind.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,560
Sometimes, you know, we really like to just do our version of peanuts.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,720
Hey everybody, welcome to yet another Procrastinator's Podcast.

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,120
We got like a huge gang here to talk about influences, starting with Mr. Endless Jess.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
I can't talk right now. I'm replying to a commenter.

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
Oh!

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
F*** you! You don't understand the first thing about art, you piece of shit.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
Followed by the best guy ever.

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,480
F*** you, you piece of shit! You don't understand the first thing about art.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,200
Mr. Tommy Oliver of Rebel Pixels. Speak up again, Tom.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
F***! F***!

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,320
This is all to establish what we sound like, so people can tell us apart when we all start screaming over each other.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:08,560
The new regular member of the Procrastinator's Podcast, formerly a guest, Jeff Thu, of his mother's basement, the professional shitbag.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
Hello. Hi, people.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Hello, everyone. Welcome him.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,960
Thank you.

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Welcome.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
Whatever way you choose to do so.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
I take cash.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,120
That was a good intro. That was a good title.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,880
Okay, we've got a couple of other people to go.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,080
We got Hippo Crit.

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,480
A hippopotamus by day. Critic by day.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,960
Sleeps by night.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,000
And Ben St., whose Patreon shall not be mentioned because it took him an hour to get into this damn podcast.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Welcome to my nightmare, viewers.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
And last but not least, The DeVoo.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
My thoughts exactly, sis.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
So today we're going to talk about influences, what they are and what ours are in particular.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
That'll probably be the bulk of this podcast.

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:07,200
But I want to start by talking about how, uh, you know, there's, there seems to be, I've seen this in criticism and in people just generally talking about stuff before,

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:17,600
where some people like really don't like to show their influences, or they really like to try to make everything like really unique and, and be like, oh yeah, everything, everything should be, uh...

57
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
Its own island of creativity.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Yeah. And I think it's, I think that if you work within a medium at all, you're already showing influence, right?

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,200
Like if you write a book, it's assumable that you understand the concept of a book from having read other books.

60
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,400
So I think that you can't escape showing your influence.

61
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
It's true. Every single medium was invented by someone.

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,840
So the mere fact that you're doing it shows that you're taking inspiration from the people who came before you to do it.

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:55,120
And you know what? On the subject of that, uh, when I, I, I was kind of sensitive to that myself back in the day, but I watched Jesse's videos and think he was really funny.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,600
And then one day I realized that, like, it's entirely composed of quotes from other things assembled in just yo, uh...

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,440
One day I realized he's not funny. He's a fraud.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
It was funny before I got it. And then once I knew, I was like, this is also hilarious because now I just get all these references.

67
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
But I will say though that if you are a genius, you can just come up with things.

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,440
I came up with larping, uh, fanfiction and summons from RPGs before I even realized they were actually a thing.

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
So take that influence.

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
I actually invented YouTube videos, actually, by the way, before anyone else did it.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
I just didn't have the means like 20 years ago when I thought of it, but yeah, I know, right?

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
It was my idea. Yeah. By the way.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
Yep, going.

74
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
Oh, nevermind. This is totally off topic, by the way.

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,400
So yeah, well, I think it's really cool when people show their influences.

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Wait, wait, I want to respond to what Guy said before. Guy, you said the thing about Jesse and noticing his influences.

77
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:56,800
And I agree. When I, when I see, when I realize like where something came from, I don't like it anymore.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
I like it less. Really? Yeah. You like it less, huh?

79
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,560
Well, honestly, like, like in terms of how much it engages me as like a thing, yeah.

80
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,400
Like, like if I'm watching a, if I'm watching a movie and it's like, oh, wow, this movie's great.

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,320
And then like a month later, I see another movie, an older movie, and I'm like, oh, wow, this must be where that comes from.

82
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,160
This did it better first. I lose some of that respect. I lose some of that respect for the one that.

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,920
Aren't you working on a Pokemon comic that's entirely based on Nuzlocke?

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,240
Should I not read your comic? Is it shit? It is shit, but yes.

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,400
I think what Ben just said is what a lot of like people, a lot of people you can talk to,

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,040
they'll usually express that kind of sentiment. And that's true.

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,920
That's a very normie sentiment. It is a very normie sentiment.

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,040
Well, I think it could also be a cultural thing, because like I used to be like that kind of,

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,440
but then Digibro over here, like really made me realize how cool it was to embrace influence.

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,920
And even though it's mostly a personal thing, I think there's a big, a big element of a cultural thing,

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,760
because over, because he's big otaku, right? You're into that anime stuff.

92
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,640
And over there, they seem way more embracing of the idea of iterative creativity, like when

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,960
video games were invented, Atari made a point. We will never make the same game twice,

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
but then Japan got in on the scene and it's just like Mega Man 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, you know,

95
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,760
that kind of stuff. Hey, are you saying Atari isn't from Japan?

96
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,880
Correct. What the fuck are you kidding me right now? Where the fuck are they from?

97
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,480
It was from America. It's just that he named it after-

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
It's from the Silicon Valley, man.

99
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Yeah, it's just that he named it after-

100
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,400
I thought you were being-

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
Oh, am I making a joke?

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah. No, no, no. He named it after-

103
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,560
Atari is a move in the game called Go, which has no other-

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
No, it's a state in Go.

105
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,200
It's-

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah, yeah. So it's a bunch of leads in America.

107
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
That's what I mean, yeah. It's a state, yeah.

108
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah, so it's-

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,880
So Weebs invented Japan.

111
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
Yeah, Weebs invented video games. That's what we're taking away from this.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,120
So, um, yeah, to talk about the influence thing, though, which is the point of the podcast,

113
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
incidentally, I mean, it sounded like I was bringing up a side topic for some reason.

114
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,200
But, um, yeah, I'm a big fan of, like, creative stuff that, like, deliberately shows its influences

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,400
because I think that you are basically recontextualizing things and I think you can often make it better.

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,960
Like, I think a lot of Jesse's humor improves on the context of the original quote he's quoting

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,160
by, you know, bringing it to something new. Like, for instance, one of the ones we all found out

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,600
about recently was when he says, ah, you unzipped me.

119
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,480
And it was originally from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but the way that Jesse did it,

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,320
like, the delivery of it and the timing was, like, perfect in his video.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,400
And it was, I think, even, I think, in the, in the original context of the original joke,

123
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,800
that line is more of a throwaway thing that Frank says in the middle of more stuff.

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,040
I don't want to suck Jesse's dick too hard on it because it doesn't really matter how good or bad

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,600
he did it.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Are you sucking my dick? It sounds like you're all calling me a heck fraud.

127
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
Did you was?

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm saying, I'm saying that when you showed me that clip from It's Always Sunny,

129
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,720
I thought that line didn't stand out in that, in that, like, in Frank's speech.

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
Okay, well, when you said it in your video, it was, like, a huge punchline.

131
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Let's not have these simpletons in the audience walk away thinking that everything I've ever

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,280
said is a line from something.

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah, no.

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
And you do the references really well.

135
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
And you know, I am the greatest writer in the world, the most creative,

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
articulate, intelligent person in the world.

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,960
Everything that I've ever said in my life is 100% unique.

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,320
I have no influences.

139
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
I influence my influences.

140
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
They take influence from me in hindsight, in retrospect.

141
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,520
All my heroes in their ranks are listening to my words.

142
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,600
Someone, someone who really put into context, like, for me, like, what is great about references

143
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
was Roger Ebert, and he wrote this review of Kill Bill, where he was talking about how...

144
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Roger Ebert, another guy that I influenced greatly.

145
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
Tarantino would take, Tarantino would basically take bits and pieces of other movies that he

146
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,360
was a fan of.

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,720
I don't know if he was a fan of, I taught him that.

148
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
I showed him that, yeah.

149
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,480
That was my...

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,360
God damn it, Nate.

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,920
I cussed it out.

152
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Because he's never gonna end if you do this.

153
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay, go on.

154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
So, he was talking about Kill Bill and how that movie, you know, takes bits and pieces

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
from all these other movies and sort of combines them into one, but he was saying how,

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
like, for instance, the song that, uh, the girl with the eyepatch whistles, the, like,

157
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,200
that one, he was like, this is from a movie from, like, the 40s, but this movie doesn't have

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,760
that song as a reference to that movie.

159
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,760
It's just something that this character happens to also sing, you know, it's not,

160
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
it's not like it's there to say, hey, remember this movie from the 40s?

161
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,480
It's like...

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
It's been given new life in the new context.

163
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
Well, that doesn't sound like a reference at all, then.

164
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
That just sounds like two movies happen to use the same song.

165
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,840
But it is a reference.

166
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,400
But he, I mean, he definitely deliberately, that song is from a 1940s movie, and he has

167
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,640
put it in his movie, but in this context, it is not referencing that movie as in, like,

168
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
like a callback to it.

169
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,000
It's more like this song happens to exist in both universes.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,520
Even though he didn't invent the song, he repurposed it.

171
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,920
The movie takes place in the real world, where that song...

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,800
What, Kill Bill?

173
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,520
Does it?

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,480
Shut up, yes.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
The movie takes place in what is ostensibly the real world, where that song exists.

176
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,160
I don't know.

177
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
I mean, I think that kind of a reference is way different than, like, I don't know.

178
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, I think that a lot of the, um, our culture's backlash towards references and tribute came

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,720
from the fact that it was overdone by people who weren't very good at it.

180
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
I believe it really took off in a good way from, like, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

181
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
which had all sorts of references.

182
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,280
But I think around the 2000s, some shows were going too far with it, particularly some kid shows.

183
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,520
Much celebrated was their, uh, their reference of stuff.

184
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Yeah, but like, uh, I remember, like, as a kid watching Kids Next Door, and that show's

185
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
references are terrible.

186
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,600
It's just annoying.

187
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
That's bullshit.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
That's a 10 out of 10 show.

189
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
There's no problems with it at all.

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
They just ripped off other whole storylines and didn't add much to it.

191
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,560
And even South Park, I felt, sometimes was getting really lazy with its references.

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,440
Like, you know, in some episodes...

193
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
Sure, some people have said that.

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Well, that's the whole problem with references is because they are lazy.

195
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
You can be like, hey, remember this thing that exists?

196
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
And people are like, well, they can be.

197
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,600
They are.

198
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,840
They can be.

199
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
I think they can take a lot of effort.

200
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,640
The funniest point, the funniest reference ever that I saw in South Park was when, um,

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,040
was when everyone was dressing up like Bane and like, and like the newscast, they would

202
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,200
show like the news and the news person would just say like, South Park is under attack

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
by Banes.

204
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,960
There's a lot of Banes coming around and kidnapping people.

205
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
Um, I believe you're the one who said like sometimes references are just, hey, remember

206
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,760
this thing?

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,960
If the references point is just to go, hey, remember this thing?

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
Then that probably sucks.

210
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
But there's a million ways for references to have a point.

211
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,080
Right.

212
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I think if I was going to take two Western cartoons to use for examples, I'd go with

213
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
Johnny Test for a bad example.

214
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,080
There was a whole episode of Pokemon parody.

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,520
The whole thing was just, hey, this is like Pokemon.

216
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
Isn't that funny?

217
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
And it wasn't.

218
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,400
And then if I was going to use good references, Steven Universe has a whole episode that's

219
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,960
like in a weird Akira parody.

220
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,200
No, it doesn't call attention to itself at all.

221
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
Which one was that?

222
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,480
The cat one.

223
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
The one where the cat turns into like a blob monster.

224
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,920
No, he grows cat fingers.

225
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
Where he turns into a, yeah.

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

227
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
He turns into like a cat Akira monster.

228
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,880
And it's like, what the fuck is, how is this happening?

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,640
I didn't realize that was an Akira thing, but thinking back on it, I totally see it.

230
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,200
You know, I don't know if I completely buy that, but whatever.

231
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
It's dude, if you watch it again, it's definitely an Akira.

232
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,880
It's definitely horrific, and a similar thing happened to Tetsuo.

233
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
The actual, like, the way that it looks and moves is really fucking.

234
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,600
Okay, if you say so, I'll believe it.

235
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,240
That show does-

236
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,320
If you want me to go all, get a different reference, the revolutionary girl Utena references

237
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
when Pearl fights her shadow.

238
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
I did a whole video on that.

239
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
That's a brilliant one.

240
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,400
Because the people who don't know what that is, no one's going to give a shit.

241
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,120
It's just a cool fight.

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
But if you do know, it's like, holy crap, that's so cool.

243
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
That's like a show I watch.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,560
Steven Universe, in general, it handles references really well, I think.

245
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,880
Like, the episode that made me fall in love with it was when they go to the movies,

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,280
which is a whole pastiche of references.

247
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,760
And then they end with Lion in the MGM logo, and that's just-

248
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Yeah, I remember being a kid, seeing reference stuff, and I'm always like,

249
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
I know this is a reference to something, but I don't know what.

250
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
But I know it's a reference because it doesn't make sense in context.

251
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
And it just made me feel uncultured, uneducated, and pissed off.

252
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,200
And Steven Universe is always like,

253
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,520
hey, this is funny in the context of the show, but if you get it, you're like,

254
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,280
oh, they're paying homage to the people who influenced them making this.

255
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,360
And that's the right way to do it.

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
As long as it's still entertaining, even if you don't get the reference,

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
I see absolutely no problems.

258
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,280
The wrong way to do it is just fucking Peter Griffin walks out,

259
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,120
gosh, this reminds me of the time that Eclectic Scene from Movie happened,

260
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,400
but with Liam Neeson in it.

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
Well, I kind of like that.

262
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,200
I kind of like the way Family Guy doesn't really did it,

263
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,240
because part of the joke is you don't know what any of this stuff is referencing,

264
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
because you're not 35.

265
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
You guys fucking love your references and whatever.

266
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,280
Oh, it goes, cultural context, but you guys are all dumb,

267
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,720
because the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, no matter what it is,

268
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,280
no matter what is being said, if it's original, it's better than if it was a reference.

269
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,840
You disagree.

270
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,320
You're dumb.

271
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,680
Anything, any reference that you can say,

272
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,840
oh, it's so cool that she did the revolution,

273
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,760
shut the heck up, whoever's talking.

274
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
It's so cool how she did the revolutionary girl,

275
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
Udna thing in Pearl, and whatever.

276
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,280
But no, it's not.

277
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,080
I mean, it might be cool, but wouldn't it have been even cooler

278
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,680
if they thought it up themselves?

279
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Yes, that's my basis.

280
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,080
I think, Steven Harris thinks up plenty of its own stuff.

281
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,520
God damn it, you're not listening.

282
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm saying that particular thing would be better if it was original.

283
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,280
If it was original, here's why, because I think that,

284
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,680
let me talk, God damn it, because that's the reason I am called-

285
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh, I hate all these fucking people.

286
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,960
They all make me so mad.

287
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,200
The reason that I called, shut the fuck up.

288
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,720
The reason I called myself the 21st century digital boy

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
is that I like stuff that's new.

290
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,680
I like the, I like stuff that's coming out now,

291
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,080
because I think that we should constantly be taking all the old shit

292
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,920
and just making it better and making it new again.

293
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm not saying that it's wrong to make references

294
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,240
or that references are bad.

295
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm just saying that if something is original, it is better.

296
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't think so, because I think that what we have to do

297
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
is take something older and say,

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,600
well, this thing is cool, but it's not that cool.

299
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,880
So what if we took all the coolest ideas from that old thing

300
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,080
and put them in this new thing with all these other cool ideas?

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,400
And we made something that's just all the coolest ideas

302
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,280
from all these old shit.

303
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,680
There's at least one time in one of my videos

304
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,920
where I almost plagiarized a short Mr. B tongue sentence,

305
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,400
not like as a shout out or a callback,

306
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,600
but because I just thought this sentence makes exactly the point

307
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,440
I need to make at this particular time,

308
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
better than anything I can think of.

309
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, let me tell you, Davoo.

310
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
And there's a couple of times where I've almost plagiarized an AVG inline

311
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
because I just thought this is the perfect thing to say.

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
Davoo, Davoo, in my current login video,

313
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,000
I specifically rip off the whole section of Mr. B tongues

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
and I made it into a joke.

315
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,280
So I recontextualized the whole thing.

316
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,240
I think it elevated the use of references to that.

317
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Pat yourself on the back a little harder.

318
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
Well, look, Ben, think about it this way.

319
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,560
I mean, when we, when people make movies,

320
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,640
like most of the shots are shots that have existed before

321
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,440
because they are shots that we have realized

322
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,920
make sense for conveying certain things.

323
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Like, you know, if we wanted to show someone doing a knife throwing thing,

324
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
like there's a certain way you cut that that makes it work.

325
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
And so there's no reason to make it completely different every time.

326
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
If there's one cut that's off the movie.

327
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,080
The scene is with Pearl fighting the hologram of herself.

328
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,720
I can appreciate that, but I still believe,

329
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
but I still believe that if two things,

330
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,480
if you have two options and one is original and one is derivative

331
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,560
and they're otherwise equal, I think the original one is.

332
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,240
Well, okay, Ben, let me ask you real quick.

333
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
What if the original thing sucks?

334
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,520
No, I'm saying if it's, if two things are equal, except one is,

335
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
one is a reference and one is a reference,

336
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,760
what two things are equal ever?

337
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,480
That doesn't even matter.

338
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm just making a thought experiment here.

339
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
If you're saying about the exact example, though,

340
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
what is going on in the specific example?

341
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
It is a sword fight.

342
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
How much do they really have to work with that?

343
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,520
Yes, perhaps.

344
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Oh my God, I don't care about the specifics of the scene.

345
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,280
It's not important.

346
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
That's exactly what you're arguing.

347
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
The point is they chose to turn that scene,

348
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
which was just a fight scene,

349
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,560
and make it into a reference and add that layer to what was going on.

350
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
What does that add?

351
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,800
What does that add to the scene?

352
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,680
All of us like it.

353
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,960
All of us like it.

354
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
Oh, great, but what does it add?

355
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
Well, no, Ben, what it adds,

356
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
when you make a callback to something,

357
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,600
to me anyway, you're calling back to what the meaning of the original was,

358
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
and it allows you to put more meaning into your scene by like,

359
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
for instance, if a show makes a reference to Evangelion,

360
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,320
then it's making reference to what that show stood for,

361
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,200
and it sort of pulls that meaning into your work in a very easy way.

362
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
What does it mean, that as fighting?

363
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,800
If you reference...

364
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,760
With a revolutionary girl, Utano fight.

365
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,800
Isn't that a little lazy?

366
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,320
Isn't it a little lazy to fall back on the meaning and the investment built up from an old show,

367
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
to try and convey that into yours?

368
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
Would you rather that they entirely retell the story of Ava,

369
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,840
just so that they can have all of the emotional buildup of Ava,

370
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
and then put it in their show,

371
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
or would you rather that they made a quick reference

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,360
that completely summarizes everything of this show that's already happened,

373
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,040
and we don't need to happen again,

374
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,200
and then puts that purpose into this new show,

375
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,920
so that we can have an even higher density of ideas.

376
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,840
Yeah, that only works if you know the original source material.

377
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Ben, your entire position makes absolutely no fucking sense to me.

378
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,040
Ben, you are writing a comic about Pokemon right now, are you not?

379
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
My problem with your stance here is the logic of it,

380
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,800
because basically you're saying,

381
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,360
if an original version is everybody as good as a reference,

382
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
then the original...

383
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,800
But here's the thing, I remember in my Q&A people asked me,

384
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,040
if killing a baby was the right thing to do,

385
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
and you had no other option, would you do it?

386
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm like, yeah, that's a very...

387
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Why would they ask me this question in your Q&A?

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,040
I know what you're gonna say, Davoo, you're saying that...

389
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
That's an overpowered question, and you're saying,

390
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,240
it's basically like saying,

391
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,560
if a salad is better, it was more healthy...

392
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
If a hamburger was more healthy than a salad,

393
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
the hamburger would be more healthy.

394
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,560
Yeah, no kidding, you just defined the terminology to be whatever you wanted.

395
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,040
No, that's not true, Davoo, you're wrong,

396
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,400
because what I'm doing is I'm setting all other aspects equal,

397
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
except for the fact that...

398
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm the biggest idiot ever.

399
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
Except for the fact that one is original and one is derivative.

400
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,240
That is the variable, that is the fucking variable.

401
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
Then if that's the only variable, then maybe, yes.

402
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Yeah, I wouldn't give the original ones a better idea.

403
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
I don't think that will ever be the case.

404
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Right, it would be a perfect...

405
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,800
And I would say that with the Perl fight,

406
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,560
that's just a little quick training fight,

407
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,320
that's not like the big finale or anything,

408
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,760
so just let it be something that's easier to make.

409
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,840
So like, why do you guys love this scene so much?

410
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,160
What is so great about the fact that it looks like Utena?

411
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
It's a cool little reference.

412
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
What's not so great about it?

413
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,960
I don't know, maybe it's because I don't give a fuck about Utena,

414
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,920
because I've never seen it.

415
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,360
Well, it elevates what otherwise would have been a totally...

416
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,440
Like, meaning the scene into something that you now care about.

417
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,240
Elevates it.

418
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
Yeah, whatever.

419
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
Here's the problem.

420
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,320
That means anything.

421
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,160
It's just like, oh, that's the thing I've seen.

422
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,000
Here's the...

423
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
It has to be super meaningful.

424
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,160
Like, does the animation in something that's really pretty,

425
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,600
like, is that really elevating?

426
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,200
I've never seen revolutionary girl Utena before,

427
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
but I watched that scene and I thought the animation looks cool.

428
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,760
I didn't know what it was referencing until everybody told me,

429
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,160
but it just looks...

430
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,800
It looks cool, and they copied it because they're not as good as animators or whatever.

431
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,920
I mean, yeah.

432
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

433
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,760
Yes, come on.

434
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Right, that's what it comes down to.

435
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
Nate, that is not what it comes down to.

436
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,480
That is totally...

437
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
I'm not saying there is good, but I'm not saying...

438
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
My point was, my point was that,

439
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,560
does it really matter that they're taking shortcuts?

440
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you care that much about, you know...

441
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
Yeah, it's not a shortcut.

442
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,200
I'm not against it.

443
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
I'm not against...

444
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,440
It is a shortcut.

445
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,760
It's not.

446
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
They're deliberately deciding to do it a certain way.

447
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
No, no, I don't agree.

448
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
I do not agree.

449
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
I do not agree that that would...

450
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,280
I do not think they said, hey...

451
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,040
Everybody shout, everybody shout, everybody shout.

452
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
Jeff's been trying to say something for like 10 minutes.

453
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah, I have.

454
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
What the heck?

455
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, okay, so Ben, like, seriously,

456
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360
your entire argument is predicated on the idea

457
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,840
that like, a scene can nebulously be better

458
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,800
if you extract all inherent meaning

459
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,440
from everything that they do in the writing, directing,

460
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,360
everything about the scene.

461
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,800
If you take that out and it's just like,

462
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,360
okay, so technically speaking,

463
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,680
this is on the same level as this.

464
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,840
That doesn't mean anything though.

465
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Like, the only question is,

466
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
is it better for your story if...

467
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
To see your point, what was that book

468
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,640
that Vincent was reading in the Vapors?

469
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
I think you should take that out, Ben.

470
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

471
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,800
No, Ben, you fucking idiot.

472
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
No, that...

473
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
You piece of shit, garbage.

474
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,680
I hate you all.

475
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Oh, okay, well, you do a reference.

476
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
No, no, what that is, what's with it, right?

477
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
It was really deep and it was...

478
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
No, no, no, he should have been reading for that book.

479
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
It is fundamentally different.

480
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,960
It is fundamentally different.

481
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
Everybody shut the fuck up right now.

482
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Everyone, listen to me,

483
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,960
that kind of reference is the sort of reference

484
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
of the girl in the Kill Bill singing a song

485
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,480
that really exists.

486
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,160
That is a reference to a real thing

487
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,760
that exists in the real world.

488
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,880
Ben, I just like to ask...

489
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
I did not have him do something exactly like...

490
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,920
Did you copy paste the text?

491
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,000
No, it's not copy pasted or anything like that.

492
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,520
It's not like the revolutionary girl

493
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Odin, a thing with Pearl,

494
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
where she just does the thing the other character does.

495
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,120
But it would have been better

496
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,040
if you wrote the original thing real quick.

497
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,760
But I think just ask you real quick, Ben,

498
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,160
because isn't it just a little bit hypocritical?

499
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,280
Now, don't get mad, I'm just...

500
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,480
No, it is not.

501
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,600
Listen to what I'm gonna say,

502
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,920
because what you're doing is you're introducing something

503
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,560
that has all this context in the outside world.

504
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
Is it really that raw?

505
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
I mean, based on your argument,

506
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
wouldn't it be better if you had somehow constructed

507
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
a book in that universe that has all this meaning

508
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
that you're applying to the situation?

509
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Yeah, no, exactly, exactly.

510
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Putting an element that really exists in the real world

511
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,080
into a work of fiction is not the same

512
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
as copying another work of fiction.

513
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,480
I get your point now, Ben.

514
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,120
Your fiction.

515
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,600
Yeah.

516
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
I see your point.

517
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,680
I think that the reason...

518
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:21,840
Don't agree.

519
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,960
I'm gonna try to justify this exact...

520
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
Disagree entirely.

521
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,920
...the scene that has come into question,

522
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,240
because the reason that Utana was animated the way it was,

523
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,920
the reason that they showed her do those specific movements,

524
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,120
was because the show was supposed to have this sort of regal,

525
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
like, it's this old-school fencing,

526
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,680
like, you know, the characters are meant to feel

527
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
like they're from the 1800s almost.

528
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,000
Like, it's supposed to bring back this image of nobility.

529
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,480
It's a show about princes and princesses fighting,

530
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
even though it takes place in a high school.

531
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,320
And that connects to Pearl's character.

532
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah, and it matches Pearl's character,

533
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,200
because she's supposed to be a knight.

534
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,160
She's supposed to be a regal, noble character.

535
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,240
Okay.

536
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,120
So using the same iconography was because

537
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,040
it would communicate the same point.

538
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,840
It would still make...

539
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,280
I tend to agree that that's...

540
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
No, I do understand.

541
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
I understand that the reason they did it

542
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
is because the sort of theme or tone conveyed

543
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
by that bit in Utana was basically similar

544
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,880
to the tone that they were trying to go for

545
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,960
with Pearl's character in Steven Universe,

546
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
so they kind of, you know, copied...

547
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,840
You know what, I just agree with the whole basis of this.

548
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
Just let me finish, just let me finish.

549
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
And but, the thing I'm saying,

550
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
it's not that it was wrong of them to do that,

551
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,640
but I am saying that the fact that it was derivative

552
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,760
and not original is, in my opinion, a weakness.

553
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,960
Well, I don't think it takes anything away from the scene.

554
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,920
I don't think you have to explain yourself

555
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,760
or apologize for putting a reference to something.

556
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
I don't think they have to apologize.

557
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,720
I just don't think it's as impressive

558
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
as it would have been if it was completely original.

559
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
It's more impressive.

560
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,520
It's less impressive.

561
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,040
Because I see it and I go,

562
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,680
wow, they did a thing like a thing on purpose

563
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,600
so that people like me who recognize the thing

564
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
would see it and appreciate it more.

565
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,280
If that same exact scene were in Steven Universe,

566
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
but Utana had never happened before,

567
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
it would be a way more impressive scene.

568
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
Nobody would even remember it if it wasn't a reference.

569
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,720
Let's let Tom say something.

570
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,800
It's interesting because I definitely am empathizing

571
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,760
with what Ben is saying.

572
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,040
I kind of get where he's coming from.

573
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,880
And I think the reason I understand where he's coming from

574
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
is because we both draw shit.

575
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
And you kind of want to be more creative that way.

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
Like you want to be more original

577
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,680
because you're more driven to do that.

578
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,880
Whereas if you guys would just analyze things,

579
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,800
being able to have those references lets you appreciate that

580
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,360
because you're able to extrapolate more from that medium.

581
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Can I just make a comparison of that fight?

582
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,800
Because I want to bring up,

583
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,640
because this fight is a direct ripoff.

584
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,000
Hang on, this fight is a direct ripoff of the Utana fight.

585
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,560
That's true.

586
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,320
And then we were arguing that that has a meaning

587
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,280
and it's a good thing.

588
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,200
But if you contrast that with a thing like in Naruto,

589
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
they shot for shot copied this fight

590
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,800
from the cowboy bebop movie.

591
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,480
And it is absolutely vapid.

592
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,960
Oh, yeah.

593
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh, no, but that's such a great reference

594
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,520
because it calls back all the emotional weight

595
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,480
of the cowboy bebop.

596
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,280
You're not listening.

597
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm arguing that it has no value.

598
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,480
That is them literally being super lazy.

599
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
And it's the same thing.

600
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,200
It's not the same thing.

601
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
That's where we disagree.

602
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,000
Because I think that that one doesn't have value.

603
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,320
I think that in the cowboy bebop movie,

604
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,400
that fight made sense because the two characters

605
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,240
were both supposed to be real people using real kung fu moves.

606
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
The fight itself is a reference to a Bruce Lee film,

607
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,640
even in the cowboy bebop movie.

608
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,080
So because of the fact that Spike uses

609
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
the same fighting style as Bruce Lee,

610
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,400
he, I think it's Jeet Kune Do, something like that,

611
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,200
he uses Bruce Lee's fighting style.

612
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I believe he uses a Jufro Jitsu.

613
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,280
And he even quotes Bruce Lee sometimes.

614
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,360
So he is meant to be a Bruce Lee character.

615
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,040
And cowboy bebop itself is a huge

616
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,200
pastiche of references to everything possible.

617
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah, I guess cowboy bebop shouldn't exist.

618
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,440
I guess we should get rid of it.

619
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, cowboy bebop just got to go.

620
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
Listen, Ghost Lightning did a series of posts

621
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
that chronicled a lot of the references in cowboy bebop.

622
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,600
Now listen, let me, let me, let me, okay.

623
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,840
So them copped, okay.

624
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,360
So obviously Naruto just copying the cowboy bebop fight,

625
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,160
that's bad and derivative and shameful.

626
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Because of the intent behind it.

627
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,120
If you are deliberately trying to make people

628
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,040
recognize it as a callback to something,

629
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,000
then that's a reference.

630
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
If you're just trying to take the dick out of your mouth

631
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,880
before you make a movie.

632
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,400
We're meeting a fucking steak.

633
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,560
The cowboy bebop movie, the cowboy bebop,

634
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,480
okay, I don't know exactly to what extent it was copied,

635
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,760
but if the cowboy bebop's like,

636
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
It's like, it's too much, dude.

637
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,040
If the cowboy bebop would be copied to Bruce Lee fight,

638
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,800
I mean, I don't think that's as bad

639
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,760
because it's translating a real world thing into animation.

640
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,560
But I think it's fundamentally the same thing,

641
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,960
even though it's much worse than another.

642
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
There is meaning in the scene in cowboy bebop.

643
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
But because of the fact that Spike

644
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
is supposed to fight like Bruce Lee,

645
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,360
that is his fighting style.

646
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,320
And in Naruto, there is no,

647
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,880
like, I mean, maybe if Rock Lee had used it,

648
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
if he was the one in this fight seat,

649
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,120
maybe it would have been more clever.

650
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
That would have been a better connection.

651
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,400
But it's characters have nothing to do with that.

652
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
Like your whole argument, Ben,

653
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,520
is it's like predicated on this idea

654
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,680
that it's inherently better to create your own iconography.

655
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,080
Yes, that is exactly my argument.

656
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
The thing is that if you are arguing that,

657
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
then your scene where your character

658
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,040
is reading your book, the only difference

659
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,480
between a character using a thing,

660
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
let me finish my point.

661
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm gonna let you finish.

662
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,280
Let me finish.

663
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,800
I've been trying to talk for like 10 minutes.

664
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,280
Because it is a fundamentally different kind of reference,

665
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,240
but go on.

666
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,160
Okay, so it's still fundamentally a reference, right?

667
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,200
So the blanket idea of you can do a reference right,

668
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
or you can do it wrong is what applies here.

669
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,560
Like if you just have a character reading fucking Catcher in the Rye,

670
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
because you want them to seem edgy,

671
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
that is a bad reference in the same way

672
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
that the Naruto fight is a bad reference.

673
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,320
That is not a bad reference.

674
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
That is totally different.

675
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Can you not see how it would be different,

676
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,160
how it would be a fundamentally different kind of reference to,

677
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,920
one, frame by frame copy a fight from a movie for the movie,

678
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
or versus having, you know,

679
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,000
fucking Spike Spiegel watching a Bruce Lee movie on TV.

680
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Those are two completely different kinds of reference.

681
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,800
Let me, so the argument that you're making

682
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
is for like the exact same distinction

683
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,320
that people complain about all the time about music in movies,

684
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,560
and how if you have like a pop insert song in a movie,

685
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,640
some people say that that's bad,

686
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,760
but if the character is listening to the pop song,

687
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,600
suddenly the fact that it's existing within that world somehow legitimizes it.

688
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,240
And I think that that argument is purely coming from this

689
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:15,040
perspective that a world of a show needs to be all the time 100 percent

690
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,360
diagetic.

691
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
Believe, yeah, diagetic.

692
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,440
And it has to stay within the fourth wall.

693
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:33,520
And the thing is that we as an audience know that this is a cartoon made out of

694
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,960
individual drawings for babies, right?

695
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,400
Yes.

696
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,720
It's not, Steven Universe isn't a real person.

697
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,360
So it doesn't, like it wouldn't make a difference if Steven Universe

698
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,680
was sitting down watching TV.

699
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,200
I wouldn't buy into that universe any more than I already do.

700
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,280
The fact that I know that this is something made by a creator

701
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,680
is another level of interest for me as somebody watching this.

702
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,160
That's a good point.

703
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,720
That's a good point.

704
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,960
And I have no idea what you're talking about.

705
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,280
I think what Jeff's trying to say is that there are,

706
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,040
like there's a level of meaning that you can get from having the character in the work,

707
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,280
be in our world and read Infinite Jest.

708
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,520
But then if you had a reference to Infinite Jest in the way the character is acting,

709
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,920
that's also another kind of meaning that we can appreciate as an audience.

710
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,400
Well, Jeff is saying that when you look at something as art,

711
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
and you see that there are references to like old anime in Steven Universe,

712
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
that tells you something about Rebecca Sugar.

713
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
It tells you something about the artist and that's valuable.

714
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,360
Right.

715
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,320
How is that valuable?

716
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
How is that valuable to the work itself?

717
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,640
It's all part of the package, man.

718
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,280
For me, it's extremely inviting to my appreciation of the show

719
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,480
because I feel like the people making it come from a similar place to me.

720
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,480
Like I watch Steven Universe and I think, huh, references to Dragon Ball,

721
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Sailor Moon, and Akira.

722
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,760
This is obviously made by someone from my generation who also grew up watching anime in the 90s,

723
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,720
who has the same kind of cultural reference points that I do.

724
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,160
And therefore I relate to the work itself.

725
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,000
Ben, can I try to interpret your position here?

726
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
Because I think I might be able to phrase it in a way that like,

727
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,720
go for it.

728
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,080
I'll interpret his position.

729
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm a big dummy.

730
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,960
Okay, so like, okay.

731
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll interpret my position.

732
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,560
All right.

733
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
That's about it.

734
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,280
Because someone can read a book, right?

735
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,920
That makes sense.

736
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,680
That's something that a normal person would do.

737
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,280
And sometimes someone might quote a movie intentionally.

738
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,040
But the human mind is so complex that there's no point at which someone's mind is going to be taken over

739
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,800
by a scene from a movie from 1993 and just suddenly they will act like this scene for five seconds.

740
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,120
That's just not something a normal person would do.

741
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,640
And it's not something that you can relate to.

742
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,800
So if all of a sudden this actual night like Pearl is suddenly doing everything that a 1997 anime character did,

743
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,680
you're like, oh, she watched Utena and is copying it.

744
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,560
But that's obviously not what's happening because she would watch anime.

745
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Anime exists in the Steven Universe universe.

746
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,600
The problem I have, I don't know about that to do.

747
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,880
And Pearl was like, wow, this is a pretty good TV show.

748
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,440
I mean, you know that's not what happens.

749
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Has Pearl ever shown interest in like, Earth culture ever?

750
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
Again though, I think.

751
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,080
Right, you're fanning it.

752
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
No, you know that's not what happens.

753
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,320
It's just that this thing that a night does exists in both universes.

754
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
It's not, in context of the show,

755
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
it's not a reference to Utena in context of like the universe.

756
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
It's just the way she fights.

757
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,840
But the way that they chose to present that.

758
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,240
Don't you think that it's fourth wall breaking?

759
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,160
Yes, that's it.

760
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,600
Don't you think that that clear kind of reference pulls you out of the work

761
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,480
and makes you aware of its artificiality in that view?

762
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,600
We already know!

763
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,920
But Jeff is trying to say, I'm already out of the work because I know it's a work.

764
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,200
Hang on, hang on.

765
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,880
Okay, I get it now.

766
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,440
Ben is making a case for those people who are not interested in a fourth wall breaking scene.

767
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,880
They're more interested in something being all contained within a universe.

768
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,040
And that's, I think you're actually making a good point here.

769
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Yeah.

770
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,960
If you, depending on what your values are, that's going to be valuable.

771
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
I don't value that at all.

772
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't value being kept within the work.

773
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,720
But the thing is, Ben, the thing is though, if you don't know it's a reference,

774
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,360
it won't matter.

775
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,760
But I think a general audience, it's way more valuable

776
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
that a thing doesn't take you out of the work.

777
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,800
Like, look, I think that's the thing.

778
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,440
Nobody knows.

779
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,720
I think it's very something to think that most people even feel

780
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,120
that they are in a work.

781
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,160
Like, I don't watch something.

782
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
That's the way you're supposed to feel when you watch something.

783
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,760
When I watch a TV show or an animal show.

784
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,400
Thank you, Tom.

785
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
It depends.

786
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,960
Like, look, my brother.

787
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,240
Go ahead, go ahead, go.

788
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,720
When I watch anything or read anything, I look at it and I,

789
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,360
sometimes I get references, sometimes I don't.

790
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,720
And then I enjoy it based on how much, how cool it was.

791
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
And then I go about my day.

792
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,400
That's it.

793
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
Why can't we just be that simple?

794
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
Why is it going to be so complex?

795
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,600
I don't think about other things.

796
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,200
I don't think at any point when I'm watching a show, do I feel like,

797
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,760
man, this is so real.

798
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,200
I am totally here.

799
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,320
You know what really bothers me about Ben's position is that,

800
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,840
to me, it seems like you're making the same case as when I say,

801
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,440
oh, another YouTube channel or a Facebook page stole my video and uploaded it.

802
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,920
And then people say, well, you referenced things in your video,

803
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,200
so you're a plagiarist too.

804
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,640
Oh, boy.

805
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,360
You are equating deliberate references with sneaky plagiarism.

806
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,560
So that is not what I'm doing.

807
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
And you're undermining actual plagiarism by doing it.

808
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,280
Here's my question for the whole, the purpose of any work of art is to get you immersed in it.

809
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,400
If that's the case, if the purpose of storytelling is to make you believe the world and that's it,

810
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:49,360
then why are shaky cam movies so much fucking worse than movies with subjective

811
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,200
artist-driven camera placement?

812
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,880
Because immersion doesn't mean an actual one-to-one interpretation of reality.

813
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,400
When you say you were immersed in something,

814
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,120
it's that you feel like you're ignoring outside stimuli.

815
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,560
You're just like, you're invested in what's going on on screen.

816
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,680
It doesn't mean like you feel like you're actually in the position of the character.

817
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,480
But my question is, if pointing, if doing something with a camera that the human eye

818
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,240
can't possibly do, which is done all the time in movies, totally OK, doesn't take you out of it,

819
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,160
then why does making a reference to something that influenced the creator,

820
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,040
which just as much acknowledges the fact that there is an artist guiding your vision of this product,

821
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
why does that take you out of it?

822
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,280
Jeff and Jesse, you guys are both misunderstanding his point.

823
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
No, no, I changed my mind.

824
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,680
I agree with Ben now.

825
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,400
Thank you.

826
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah.

827
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,320
You agree with me?

828
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,800
No.

829
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,360
Well, here's the thing.

830
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,600
Really?

831
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,640
Jesse's just like that.

832
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
I'm switching sides.

833
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm on Ben's team.

834
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,840
Why Jesse?

835
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm on Ben's team, too.

836
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,560
What changed just now, Jesse?

837
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,800
Well, because I remembered that sometimes I get guys who say they're influenced by me on YouTube

838
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,360
and then I watch it and they're just stealing my word from word, and that pisses me off.

839
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,680
How do you think that the person that animated that scene in Revolutionary Girl,

840
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,520
Ootna, feels when she watches Steven Universe?

841
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,280
OK, well, no, I'm not on your team anymore.

842
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,480
OK, I just deleted these Steven Universe people actually watched my show from 30 years ago.

843
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
OK, OK, fine.

844
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,360
Only because that was like 30 years ago.

845
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,720
You know what? I'm off Ben's team.

846
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,680
I almost agreed with him.

847
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,800
You almost had it.

848
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,000
You almost had that Jesse vote.

849
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,560
What we're really talking about here is what we're really talking about here is suspension of disbelief

850
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
and it's totally different for everybody.

851
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
What will break your suspension of disbelief?

852
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,680
How big your cord is.

853
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,960
My suspension of disbelief gets broken by totally different weird random things

854
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,880
that have nothing to do with references.

855
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
Like I still feel like even though I don't like when I watch Steven Universe,

856
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I think, OK, obviously this is a show.

857
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,640
It's animated.

858
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,760
It's made by people.

859
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
I know how the sausage is made.

860
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,480
I know what goes into it.

861
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,760
I know how each shot is meant to make me feel an emotion.

862
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
And more so than feeling that emotion, I just think about the technique used.

863
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
But that doesn't mean that I don't have any attachment to the story

864
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,880
because when I when I see the references and things,

865
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,920
I just think they're cool and I like the story overall.

866
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm willing to suspend my disbelief because here's an example going on.

867
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,200
My brother, when he looks at cover art,

868
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,920
like I was showing him like panning and stalking on Mal

869
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,840
and he was like the cover art bothered him

870
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,560
because the characters were facing with their weapons toward the camera.

871
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,440
But the enemy that they should be fighting was behind them,

872
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,640
making a dramatic pose.

873
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
And my brother was like,

874
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
why aren't they aiming their weapons at the enemy?

875
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,600
It completely threw him off and he hated it.

876
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
But whenever a cover is such a weird I know right.

877
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
But it really pisses him off because he's like into weapons

878
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
and fighting and stuff and hunting and shooting.

879
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,280
But whenever a cover art is just like abstract,

880
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,080
like there's just like a photoshop filter in the background,

881
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,320
he doesn't mind because it's that level of abstraction.

882
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,720
But panning and stalking, that cover art's in a city.

883
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,920
And so it throws them off.

884
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,600
I would have never, ever, ever thought of that.

885
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,080
So that's different levels of suspension of disbelief.

886
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
That everyone has different stuff that will break it.

887
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,000
And so we respect your differences.

888
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
We understand.

889
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,520
All right.

890
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
And we respect them in your life choices.

891
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,320
Let me just defend myself one last time.

892
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,040
Vincent reading infinite jest is not the sort of reference

893
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,120
that will that can break your suspension of disbelief.

894
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
Because I agree with that.

895
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
That is true.

896
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
That is what's different about that.

897
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Now that we have settled that question,

898
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,720
perhaps we should move on to the next part.

899
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,040
Right.

900
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah.

901
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
Part two of this, we actually talk about our influences.

902
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
The actual point of the podcast.

903
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,760
The actual point now.

904
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,680
Well, I intended from the time that I first suggested it,

905
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,520
this podcast, for us to talk about influences in like how they work.

906
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,760
And then for us to talk about influences,

907
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,160
I just thought the first part would only be five minutes long

908
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,480
because I didn't expect a complete disagreement.

909
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,920
Oh, you guys want a more specific example of influence chains.

910
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
Go listen to, I don't know if this plug is okay with you, Digi,

911
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,120
but you have this old podcast where you talk about Pacific Rim

912
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,040
and how people say it ripped off Evangelion.

913
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,560
So you spent an hour talking about its lineage of Evangelion

914
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,160
to prove how everything is a rip-off.

915
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,320
And that was a very interesting podcast

916
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,760
that really makes the case one-sidedly, my dad,

917
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,840
about why references are omnipresent and good.

918
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,040
I know that everything is a rip-off to some degree.

919
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,320
I just think that that's not a good thing necessarily

920
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,560
and that the less of a rip-off you are, the better.

921
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,880
Yeah, I'm back on Ben's team.

922
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,560
If you want the continuation of that whole idea train of thought,

923
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,000
yeah, go listen to that Pacific Rim podcast, I guess.

924
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,160
And then now let's get into this.

925
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,000
Nate, you said that you had the shortest list of references or influences.

926
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
That's not true, but I did say I could go through it quickly.

927
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,800
Well, someone has to go first and throw themselves in front of the bus to set the tone.

928
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,280
I have the least desire to talk about mine at great length

929
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,680
because I'm currently ashamed of how small my channel is,

930
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,360
so I can just bang this thing out of my mind.

931
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,720
Nate, tell us about your influences.

932
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,400
Okay, so first of all, to set the context,

933
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,920
what I'm really describing here is the things that are affecting

934
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,040
the way that I make videos, how I came to this point,

935
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,800
and that's it.

936
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I'm not talking about anything outside of this shit.

937
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,120
Okay, so I've been saying for a while that I wanted to be the John Tron of anime,

938
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,080
and that was at a time when John Tron was good,

939
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,040
times have changed, and he's shit.

940
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,000
But still, there's an ideal of John Tron's golden age that I want to be at,

941
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,320
even though our styles are totally different, so whatever.

942
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,000
Demolition D is another guy who's my current hero,

943
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,200
who also is a totally different style who I'll never be able to be like exactly,

944
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,640
but whatever, he's a guy.

945
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:45,920
So the two guys that really kind of kickstarted the whole analysis shit on YouTube in the first

946
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
place were the Red Letter Media guys, specifically the Mr. Plinkett reviews,

947
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,560
and in particular the Mega Man Sequelitis that Egoraptor made specifically.

948
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Those two were kind of the things that made me realize that like,

949
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,320
oh wow, you can go like so fucking hardcore in analyzing shit online and people are into it.

950
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
So you know, those were a game changer.

951
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,720
Jesse Wood is a big one.

952
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:19,120
He has, I don't like him at all, but it would be, I cannot deny that he's been a large influence on

953
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,680
me, and to an extent every single person in this chat.

954
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,880
Probably, I mean, Ben is my brother, and we collaborated for a long time, and even today.

955
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,600
I would call that a form of mutual influence.

956
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,200
Yeah, I mean, I could say, I could go and be like, oh my dad, and like my teachers,

957
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,200
but like whatever, but still, Ben is someone who to this day, I still

958
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
share my stuff with and ask his opinion on stuff.

959
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,280
I think there's a lot of both of our unique preferences in T-Bap, and when I look at them,

960
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
I can often see like, oh, this is a me thing, and this is a Nate thing.

961
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,920
Yeah, like all the good stuff's the Nate stuff, all the bad stuff, that's the Ben stuff.

962
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,160
That's correct, that's correct.

963
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,880
No, all the emotional pathos is me.

964
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,760
No, that's all me.

965
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,280
No, I care about feeling this.

966
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,920
No, with Keg and Phantom sitting on that island, looking out into the sunset,

967
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,320
sad about their failures in life, that's me.

968
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay, that's all me.

969
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,200
But Keg tucking in Phantom after his horrific nightmare dream, that was all me, and let's

970
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,120
be honest, which of those is more impactful?

971
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,640
All right, moving on.

972
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:23,520
Now, this probably hasn't been seen a lot yet, but I am kind of obsessed with musical numbers.

973
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,320
Everything that has a musical number.

974
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,520
It has been, because you have like three whole videos of just musicals on it.

975
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,920
I know, and in fact, but you see, that's not really my ideal, and I'll get into this in

976
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,080
a little bit, but I absolutely lose my shit when there's like, and Jesse is the guy who

977
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,160
does this the most, will make a video, and then there's just like a related song in it

978
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,720
that might, that is usually related to what's going on.

979
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,080
That is my favorite thing, and I've aspired to be like that, and you see that in a bunch

980
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,800
of T-Bab videos, and I've actually just wrote a song yesterday to put into a video that's coming

981
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,240
up, and it's going to blow everybody's minds, so I'm being into that shit, and when I was

982
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,080
younger, I did musicals, I did plays, and stuff on stage in high school, and then college a little

983
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,840
bit, so that was, that's something.

984
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:13,360
And on this note, kind of the one video that I aspire to be like, I know not everyone's going

985
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,200
to be excited about it, but it's Antony C's reviewing his magic part four, Cantralot wedding.

986
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
It didn't even have a musical number guy.

987
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,120
No, I know, I was going to say the only thing that could have made it better would have been

988
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,920
musical number, that's the, technically on the technical fronts, not everything is perfect,

989
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,160
but the structure of it, just like laying out shit, and then having a big like catholic reveal at

990
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,840
the end, that is exactly what I love about it.

991
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,120
You know Tommy made that too, right?

992
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,920
I was going to say, I was going to say, Tom was in it, and had a strong, but we know that it was

993
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,720
Antony who wrote it, and did all the, you know, the structuring of the video, so Tom, certainly

994
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,680
to be celebrated.

995
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,320
Is that so?

996
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,120
Um, I mean, I would say he did a lot of the general structure, but there's a lot of writing

997
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,000
stuff that I do as well.

998
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,920
Oh, okay, I heard that he did like a hundred percent of it, and you just did voice over,

999
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,520
so if that's not true, I'm not mistaken.

1000
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,280
I wrote all of my lines and made a point to interject a lot of the things I said that he

1001
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,480
wasn't going to talk about at all.

1002
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,560
Okay, I stand corrected.

1003
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,320
So thank you for that, Tom.

1004
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,680
Papa bless, moving on.

1005
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,560
Okay, the last guy here, the last two, the two specific guys, oh sorry, there's three are just-

1006
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
Oh my god, how long is this list going to go on?

1007
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,320
I don't know dude, there's, I'm almost done.

1008
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,040
These three guys are kind of linked together.

1009
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,120
Mr. Beetong, Twin Perfect, and Matthew Matosis are just YouTube and a lot of analytical guys,

1010
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,800
whatever, they make their shit.

1011
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,320
They're someone who I look at a lot, just to get ideas.

1012
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,760
And then, I don't know, just at the end, it's just like all the video games I've ever played,

1013
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,560
all the anime I've ever watched, and all the manga I've ever read, all that shit.

1014
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,400
And shout out to Gurren, Logan, and Kamina as my personal favorite.

1015
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,960
That's it.

1016
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,240
Okay, let's move on.

1017
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,200
Pretty good list.

1018
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,520
Yeah.

1019
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,600
Hippo, you want to go next?

1020
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah, okay.

1021
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,920
I don't really know how to start, but I got a lot of-

1022
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,880
At the beginning.

1023
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,120
Yeah.

1024
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:08,720
I've got a lot of comedy thing, because my comedy is my sole talent, I think, it's my main thing.

1025
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
Yes, I can confirm that, that's true.

1026
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,040
So yeah, I got a comedy, guys.

1027
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,680
There's quite a few old things.

1028
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,040
There's the Goon Show, which is an old radio show, an English radio show, where these guys,

1029
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,200
they just did silly voices, and I liked silly voices, and that's the Goon Show.

1030
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,440
There's Monty Python, obviously, we're for sort of the weird out there situations, and

1031
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,760
not explaining really anything, and I like all that stuff.

1032
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Laurel and Hardy has got a lot of great slapstick, and it made me appreciate comedy timing.

1033
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:54,160
I don't know how well all of this stuff translates into my videos, but I just like it.

1034
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,600
Well, the stuff you're saying so far sounds like it's in your videos.

1035
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,720
Yeah, like the Monty Python influence, I just totally see that with your live-action stuff,

1036
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,400
and you're editing too.

1037
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah, I mean, my editing comes mostly from YouTube poop, and then to, I guess,

1038
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,120
there was John Tron with all his text stuff.

1039
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,480
I don't know, there's AVGN, I'm just reading off a list now.

1040
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:29,120
And then there's Jesse, and Davoo, and Digi, and yeah, I like all your stuff.

1041
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,480
Yeah, very recently, Davoo, because I watched all your videos, and I'm like,

1042
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,040
you make videos about a singular point, and I like that, and I'm going to try and do that.

1043
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,400
I think my puzzle pirates video was made mostly because I watched all those.

1044
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,640
Oh, that's cool, but hippo, please, please give us more hippo vits.

1045
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,600
I really want more sad hippo, I really liked your April Fool's video,

1046
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,600
because it was more of that hippo than I liked.

1047
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,960
That was amazing, hippo more than I like you.

1048
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,960
For the record, I still love everything that gets posted to the Give and Take channel,

1049
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,600
I still always usually find it hilarious.

1050
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,160
Yeah, me too.

1051
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,960
Just the stuff that he records in five minutes and doesn't give a single fuck about it.

1052
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,240
By the way, I also like cold corona more than I like myself.

1053
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,400
Absolutely, cold corona got me into vaporwave.

1054
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,120
Me too.

1055
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,720
I'm not kidding about that, by the way.

1056
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
Dude, that's totally true, that's totally true for me as well.

1057
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,240
All right, Jeff, you want to go next?

1058
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,320
I guess, yeah, I just finished typing up my list now pretty much, so that's perfect.

1059
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:47,920
Yeah, so, oh man, I try to take influence from a broad amount of things, but not consciously,

1060
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,640
I guess I'd say.

1061
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,560
I consume a lot of media, and I think that just informs how I create things in general.

1062
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:05,680
There are some obvious points of reference that, no question, these guys influence how I make stuff.

1063
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,040
The Extra Credits, I've been a fan of Extra Credits for a very long time.

1064
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,960
Oh no, you blew it on the first one.

1065
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,240
I blew it, that's fine.

1066
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,200
Hey, wait, what's wrong?

1067
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,520
Hey, Extra Credits was at a time, was really great, and they were part of what influence me as well.

1068
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,720
Yeah, they were instrumental in my thinking on video games today, like they were big games all the time.

1069
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,960
I really like the Extra Credits series, I still like it, I don't know if you guys still like it,

1070
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,360
but that's a matter of taste, and like more to the point.

1071
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,880
I make the press time, my voice is high-pitched.

1072
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,600
Yeah, he sounds like an idiot.

1073
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,320
We really gotta make more of these games, so it's just conscious, I know his feelings get hurt.

1074
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
Let me talk, guys.

1075
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,760
Go force your way in.

1076
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,640
Yeah, so, A, the voice thing is like something people expect at this point.

1077
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,040
You don't have to defend it, but we believe that you like it.

1078
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
It's one octave per video.

1079
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,480
I don't even mind the voice thing, I just hate their fucking milk toast, middle of the road,

1080
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,120
like fucking weak ass politics.

1081
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,200
That's like a newer thing.

1082
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,840
If you watch their older videos, it used to just be they took a fucking game design principle,

1083
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:21,360
and they explained it, and it was really interesting, and they had like 100 great videos.

1084
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,600
Who cares, we're talking about influence, like John Tron's not good anymore,

1085
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
but fucking me talking about him being an influence.

1086
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah, he's an influence on lots of people, but yeah, so like, and like I have to-

1087
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,520
He was here in his early days, like man, there was a lot of people like that guy.

1088
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:45,440
Okay, I have to acknowledge them like straight up, because as a direct influence,

1089
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,440
because Dan's a friend of mine, and he actually gave me a lot of advice for video editing that

1090
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,080
has made my videos better, so right off the bat, I've got to acknowledge him.

1091
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,640
That's great, next time you see him, you can just punch him in the arm for me.

1092
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,680
Just give him one, boom.

1093
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,960
And then there's like my film school teacher, Paul Jensen, who taught me a lot about narrative

1094
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,760
structure and film analysis and stuff like that.

1095
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,600
So those are like the people who I know who have made what I make better,

1096
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,120
and then I watch a lot of every frame of painting.

1097
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,720
I've watched all of his videos at least like four or five times.

1098
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,840
He's kind of what I want to be in a lot of ways, and in the same respect,

1099
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,360
Cinefix is, I don't know if you guys- I do not know them.

1100
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:44,640
So Cinefix is one of the best movie channels, probably the best large movie channel and large

1101
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,520
list channel on the entire internet, because A, they do movie analysis from a very interesting

1102
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,800
in-depth perspective.

1103
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,160
They have these videos called Seven Things You Might Not Know, where they just list really

1104
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:06,640
interesting and minute trivia details about different movies, how they were made, what

1105
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,880
influenced the story behind them, different details about the differences in the adaptation from

1106
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:20,160
a comic to a movie or what have you, and then they also do these big broad lists that I totally

1107
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,440
ripped off the style of in my top 10 anime openings of 2015, where basically they will say,

1108
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,840
these are the 10 best scenes in movies of all time, and the way that they do it instead of

1109
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,280
like listing just 10 scenes, they list like 50, and every time they get to a point they're like,

1110
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,000
we could have gone with all of these different things, which are all great, and that totally

1111
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,440
validates like your feeling that this scene is particularly good, but we went with this,

1112
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:56,080
and then they justify why this thing that does say in there is sold me.

1113
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,520
I really want to watch this channel.

1114
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:05,920
They are seriously the best movie channel on the internet, and like everything about how

1115
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,200
I write my lists is derived from the just that awesomeness.

1116
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,880
Yeah, I need something to replace movie Bob now that I finally unsubbed him.

1117
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:22,560
Yeah, they are, let's not dive into that, because that's an example of somebody who's

1118
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,000
politics. I just realized I had to out the window. I actually don't even

1119
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,800
mind Bob's politics, but whatever. I was just going to say, I forgot to bring up the influence of

1120
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:40,480
all the people who I swore I would never ever become like. Movie Bob is up there for me,

1121
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,320
kind of up there in the same vein, but also I really respect what he does is Spoonie,

1122
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,200
because I love Spoonie's videos, but how he treats people online, not great.

1123
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,440
Oh, that's bullshit. Spoonie doesn't treat people harshly enough. Spoonie should be meaner than

1124
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,160
his fucking fans. Jesse, yeah, Jesse, he'd get more Patreon money that way for sure.

1125
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,400
Jesse's Patreon money is only exclusively because the people who give him money love

1126
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,680
to be abused. Every time I shit on somebody, it's skyrockets. We just saw this like yesterday

1127
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,680
with your new video. No, that's true, but yeah, so there are people I'm definitely never want to

1128
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:29,200
be like, but who I take some things from, like Spoonie and John Trun don't want to emulate their

1129
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,520
production schedule at all, but their sense of humor definitely influences me. And Aaron's signal,

1130
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,280
Mr. Beetong, you guys brought them up before, Egoraptor, Super Bunny Hops, another guy who

1131
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,280
I try to get to that. I'm very impressed with how George is able to just like

1132
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,120
find the point of something and explore it fully. To your credit, I'd currently describe

1133
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,360
you as the bunny hop of anime. I don't think so because he only does OPs. I only do OPs.

1134
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,120
He's broadening a little bit. I think the most similar thing between Jeff and George is the

1135
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:11,760
production schedule rate. But I would say that bunny hop is much more about like covering up

1136
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,520
like, well, he finds he like, like Jeff said, he finds the point of a game, but he does find the

1137
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,160
point of the whole game. Whereas Jeff is mostly focused on individual levels or individual,

1138
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:28,480
you know, OPs or like, you know, elements with the exceptions of some of his game reviews.

1139
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:37,200
They're similarities. I'm trying to do more stuff like that, but it's a lot easier to get

1140
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,680
out a weekly video while focusing on one specific scene or one specific thing.

1141
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,080
The biggest praise that I've ever gotten was somebody like comparing me to every frame of

1142
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,880
painting, which I don't think I deserve. Oh yeah, that's lofty praise.

1143
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,200
He's the best editor on YouTube, period.

1144
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,080
So then beyond, beyond sort of this, well, I guess we're not beyond the sphere of YouTube yet,

1145
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:26,720
because I also derive a bit of a, a lot of stuff that I never, ever want to do with my videos

1146
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,840
from Channel Awesome, just as a general production thing. I think we can all agree on that. I think

1147
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,440
we all have them as like our worst guys. A guest's person, what are you doing here?

1148
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,840
Nate, you took the words out of my mouth. I know, right? Just, just, just say a word.

1149
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,520
Somebody pops in at the end of the review. You try to murder them, that whole thing.

1150
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:59,920
Cat Icarus does that some, a lot of the time, but yeah, so Channel Awesome in general,

1151
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,160
there's a lot of stuff I would never fucking do integrating a narrative into my videos. No,

1152
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,080
not fucking happening. I'm sorry, Linkara. No, no, I'll,

1153
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,720
wait, why are you apologizing to Linkara? I, I don't know. He doesn't deserve any apologies.

1154
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:23,120
Exactly. I like the idea of doing a narrative in a single video. If you could do it easily,

1155
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,080
but over a bunch of videos, Jesse does it with every video he puts out as part of a continuing

1156
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:34,320
narrative. Yeah, but, but Jesse integrates it into his script instead of having like a skit

1157
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,920
on the side where it's like, now I'm on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise.

1158
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,960
And just, if, if the video is about a narrative, then sure. And, and you know,

1159
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,720
it uses like a review or whatever as sort of like a framework for the narrative. Yeah,

1160
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,720
but if you're just tacking on a narrative onto the outskirts of a video that is supposed to be

1161
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:59,840
a family review. Yeah, Jesse does, like Jesse, I think, does what Spoonie kind of tried to do,

1162
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:07,040
but a lot more efficiently and just better integrated, which is this. Spoonie puts these

1163
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,800
like big teasers at the end of his videos and then he won't make another one for like two years.

1164
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:18,160
Yeah. It sucks. But like the, whereas Jesse, it just has a man losing his mind. Yeah, I gotta,

1165
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,840
I gotta keep powering through. So there was one person on Channel Awesome who did influence me

1166
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:36,880
in a very, in a very positive way. No, shut, shut the fuck up. Yeah. So no, in how I talk

1167
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:48,960
about anime and how I understand it, Yezu Otaku, Jacob Chapman now working for A&N, who was like

1168
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,840
the only good anime reviewer doing video anime reviews on the internet for like a couple years.

1169
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:04,800
And like a lot of what started getting good if you're thinking about anime was

1170
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,720
Slim Pickens back in the day, did you? Yeah, it was very Slim Pickens.

1171
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:17,120
And if you're watching video. Watching her videos kind of got me hungry for that kind of

1172
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,480
thought about anime and made me want to do that. And I don't think that she's right

1173
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,480
a lot about a lot of stuff or he is right about a lot of stuff. But

1174
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:34,560
Wait, is Jesse Otaku a man now? Yes. That's, huh? How about that? Yeah. So anyway,

1175
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:44,560
I don't agree with a lot of his criticism of stuff. But for instance, the fact that he did those

1176
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:51,120
big top lists of the top 10 anime OPs of every year is totally where I got the idea for what's

1177
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:58,240
in an OP. Like just like talking about OPs, I was like, there is not enough of that on the internet.

1178
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:05,920
I am going to do that. So if that is a very obvious point of reference. Now, finally,

1179
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:13,120
I can break away into people in text who influenced me. We gotta speed it up a little bit.

1180
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:19,680
Okay, I'll try to speed it up a little or a lot. Sean Baby, one of my favorite writers on the whole

1181
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,600
internet definitely informed my sense of humor quite a lot. Pitchfork, who's a guy who wrote for

1182
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:33,760
SoxMatePeopleSexy.net. Not Pitchfork.com. Life of Pablo 9 out of 10. Yeah, I remember that.

1183
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:43,200
Life of Pablo9outof10.com, yeah. Not that. Oh, you should get that domain. Okay. I should.

1184
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:56,240
Yeah, so definitely not them. But yeah, so he did these epic reviews of the entire Final Fantasy

1185
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:08,240
series that I really appreciated. And, okay, moving forward, faster pace. Okay, Chris.

1186
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,280
Just read all the names. Just read them off your list.

1187
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:18,240
Okay, writers, Christopher Moore, Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, all informed my sense of humor

1188
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,880
and sort of how I string ideas together. Very good writers. Highly recommend you read their stuff if

1189
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,320
you want to do more stuff. Forgot your movie sucks. Obvious reasons. Your movie sucks is great.

1190
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,120
Monty Python, Abbott and Costello, Justin Rowland, Dan Harmon, James Roday.

1191
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,760
You should have got the music that they play at the Academy Awards when we're on Blushy.

1192
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,800
Just, I'm feeling this fucking hook around my neck because I'm trying to get through this.

1193
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:52,320
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are movie creators and actors who inform how I make stuff. Also,

1194
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,480
Team Four Star kind of informs some of my sense of humor and delivery and whatnot. Sure.

1195
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,000
All right, don't fuck you off. I'm fucking bored of listening to you.

1196
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:09,440
Okay, one more. One more. The best friends play, they kind of gave me a lot of how I

1197
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,440
want to structure podcasts because they do podcasts without crazy arguments and people

1198
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,600
talking over each other. How does this one stack it up by that standard?

1199
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,520
It's terrible. Go listen to the best friend cast instead.

1200
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,240
We're not friends here.

1201
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,480
This is the best group of people who all want to murder each other.

1202
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,920
We're the best enemies podcast.

1203
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,640
Let's get an artist talking about art shit now.

1204
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,040
Cog and a half. All right. Well, my list isn't is pretty short. As an artist,

1205
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:46,640
I think my two major influences are Brian Leo Malley, the Scott Pilgrim guy, and Hiro Oda,

1206
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:52,880
the one piece guy. And when I look at my own art, I can really it really looks like both of them

1207
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,080
to me like this. I don't know. Vincent reminds me a lot of

1208
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,680
Sanji. Yeah, kind of Sanji. He kind of he kind of looks like Sanji. What about Andrew Hussie?

1209
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,320
Oh, yeah, you know, I was gonna say Andrew Hussie. I don't know. There's no like direct

1210
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,440
eat a dick. Hey, here's. Hey, everyone. At least he's gotten to the point of knowing who Andrew

1211
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:19,360
Hussie is. That's like we've we've friends, friends and listeners. Hear me. Once you're done,

1212
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:24,080
anyone that hasn't read, then everyone who hasn't read Homestuck should be put through

1213
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,720
a fucking meat grinder. That's what I'm home stuck and I'm the biggest idiot ever.

1214
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:41,600
That isn't pretty accurate. That is a pretty accurate parody, honestly. Okay. And yeah,

1215
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:48,880
there's there's yeah, art wise, definitely. Brian Liam Alley and Hira Oda. Hussie, I wouldn't

1216
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,840
there's no like direct influence other than that, you know, what he was making and the rate at which

1217
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:59,840
he was made it really, really wanted to made me want to do something like that. I wouldn't call

1218
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,160
it a direct influence, but Bakuman, the manga about a bunch of hot blooded Shonen trying to

1219
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,800
become great manga artists. Yeah. Again, not so much a direct influence, but like a big

1220
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,920
pushed me into wanting to do that with my life.

1221
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:22,080
You know, I think that's it. Oh, and I will. It's one more thing. The Vapors story is largely

1222
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:28,400
inspired by Watamote because like that, it's just about a young person being really shitty. And

1223
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,680
that's the whole story. And that's what Vapors is about. I forgot Tim Schaefer and Hideo Kojima.

1224
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:39,120
Tim Schaefer and Hideo Kojima are on my lists. I got three names. I'm just saying quick.

1225
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:46,080
My I got storytelling inspiration and influence from Hira Oda, Okami and Dark Souls. And I'm

1226
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:51,680
not going to elaborate because I'm not very good at telling stories. Okay, cool. All right. Well,

1227
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:56,240
Ben didn't give us enough art stuff. So Tom, now it's your turn. All right. Um, yeah, it's funny

1228
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,760
because like originally, I just had to know it. I said YouTube. I don't know sequel artists. I don't

1229
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,040
care. I don't remember to have another YouTube channel that I actually care about.

1230
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:08,400
So like reviews, fuck it, whatever. I've watched sequel artists and then I made a horse one and

1231
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,240
then it all devolved from there. But Rebel Pixels, like I got the idea for that. Just because I really

1232
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,040
I watched way too much technology stuff like I've read and gadget daily for I think

1233
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:24,160
12 years now. So like I know too much about that shit, but I watched the shit out of MKBHD,

1234
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,520
who does like ridiculously good tech videos, Linus Tech Tips, another one. And then the idea of

1235
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,800
for half of Road Pickles came from a guy on Tumblr called Rebel Pickles. That's what I call my dick.

1236
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:43,520
No. I would have thought that's what you call your balls because you know, there's two of them.

1237
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,080
What the fuck Nate? Balls don't look like pickles. Oh, wait, wait. What's wrong with your balls?

1238
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,200
But there's it's plural. God damn it. Okay. Maybe the whole set of three you can call the road

1239
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,880
Yeah. Oh my God. Wow. I think we've made it. I think we've covered a lot of ground here today.

1240
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,000
All right, so

1241
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,200
no, so half of Rebel Pixels came from a guy called friend and he's on Tumblr. He reviewed like

1242
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,600
Cintiq alternatives. And that's kind of where I found out that those even existed. And as a poor

1243
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,240
person, I was initially attracted to the idea of like getting something expensive for less money.

1244
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,160
So but he just does text reviews and text is boring. So I was like, if I didn't

1245
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,120
make videos about these, I'll make a million dollars. And I was completely wrong, but it's

1246
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,080
still fun. And then the other half came from this guy pressed and smiles. He does like a lot of

1247
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,400
motivational kind of videos. And I wanted to kind of do something like that with an artist

1248
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,080
focus, I guess, because I'm like super impressed and hate myself and hate everything I make. So I'm

1249
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,840
like, maybe if I go on this journey, I could not hate myself. So that's kind of I just blended

1250
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,360
those two together. And that's where the pixels came from. And also, I've been notified of Roberto

1251
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:55,120
Blake, who I hate. I don't want to ever become as bad as that channel. Who's who's that? He's

1252
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,920
a guy who makes like two videos a day. And he just sits in front of a camera. He's like, Hey,

1253
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,120
everybody, bro Blake here, helping you create something awesome today. Today, I want to talk

1254
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:12,000
and how does he do that? He does it with like no effort. There's one take. And he has like 80,000

1255
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
subscribers. He got 70,000 last year. I don't understand why. And if I see him in public,

1256
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,440
I'm going to kill it. No, he he has like the same amount you have on Tommy Oliver. Yeah,

1257
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,400
but he got that in here. Just talking in front of a camera with no script. And he has a he has

1258
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,280
fucking sort of online. Nobody watches his videos. That's the whole thing. He got subscribers. Like

1259
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,800
it's really weird how people do that. You if you want to get subscribers really quick, just make

1260
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,720
like five videos a week. And you'll get tons of people clicking on them. But no one watches

1261
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,440
your other shit because you just like flood your feed. And then nobody cares. You burn them out.

1262
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,120
Yeah, that's how I don't know if I don't know if I miss this time. But are there any more

1263
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,680
specific influences on like Sorceress Lost? Did I miss that? No, I haven't gotten it yet.

1264
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,880
Because like this is just like the YouTube. Yes, stupid. I thought it was wrapping up.

1265
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,360
I thought it was wrapping up my bag. For like the artistic side, like I mean my visual style,

1266
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:01,600
I feel is definitely directly influenced a lot from Bill Watterson of Calvin and Hobbes fame.

1267
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,360
I just I've read that comic cool religiously ever since like third grade. And it's like my favorite

1268
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:10,400
thing ever is the first comic I ever really got into. Because he has like kind of like the really

1269
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,400
cartoony features like the thick outlines. And then like I really fell in love with watercolor

1270
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:21,360
from his color work. Bruce Tim is a huge influence. He did like the DC animated universe,

1271
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:26,320
like the Batman cartoon from the 90s and Justice League. Oh, yeah. Like I like his really like

1272
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:31,840
simplistic kind of blocky figures. Like this main guy or in Sorceress Lost, which I haven't

1273
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,400
seen much his jawline is like a square just like Superman. So like I'm totally just aping that.

1274
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,880
And like anime in general. But the first one that I read because I watched like Pokemon and

1275
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,160
shit as a little kid, obviously, and that was my first exposure to anime. But the first anime

1276
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,880
or like manga that I thought was like legitimately beautiful was when I watched

1277
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,840
Cardcaptor Sakura and then later got chosen. Yes. Clamp blew my fucking mind. Yeah. Yeah,

1278
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,800
that's awesome. And like to this day, I still like love Clamp. So I never would have imagined you

1279
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,400
were like influenced by Clamp. Like your style does not at all remind me of Clamp. I mean like

1280
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,920
well, you never know. Like I think like the thing that I took from them was like the really big

1281
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:15,040
expressive eyes. Like that's one thing I really latched on to. It's like a Pokemon. Clamp. Clamp.

1282
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Jesse is obviously not familiar with the work of Clamp. It's like it's like the it's like the evolved

1283
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:34,160
form of Clannad. Clannad is the baby. Clamp is the peach. Clannad has even bigger eyes than

1284
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,400
Clamp. So yeah, Clannad would be the evolved form. Clannad would be the final evolution.

1285
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,160
Okay, so if Clannad is a crab with testicles, then what is Clamp as the baby? Clamp is a crab with

1286
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,840
one testicle. And if testicle looks like a pickle.

1287
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,680
Anything else? The last thing I mean, I just like got a note for like lifestyle slash personality

1288
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,960
because like a lot of artists like I don't really take much like visually or like aesthetically

1289
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,080
from their work, but just like how they work. I was really influenced by Scott McLeod, who wrote

1290
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:12,000
Understanding Comics. Is he really into Fox McLeod? No. Yeah, he's the same guy. That's just his

1291
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,360
persona. But like he did like a really great book called Understanding Comics. It's a comic book

1292
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,760
deconstructing how comics work. And he did this like when he was like in his mid 20s. So he's like

1293
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,200
a fucking genius. Oh, Ben, is this manga about drawing manga that is awesome as well? Yeah, we

1294
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,440
remember when we're, are you showing me that together? Yeah, that's right. That was like.

1295
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:38,400
Oh, um, um, show, the Shojo manga artists. Oh, wait, I have it right here.

1296
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,680
I still need to read that book. I was really intrigued by it. It's the coolest. It is called,

1297
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,920
it is Shojo Beats Manga Artist Academy and it follows the, and it follows the life of Hitomi,

1298
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,600
who is this retarded panda who wants to be a Shojo manga artist. What? And so, no, I'm fucking

1299
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,000
serious. And then, and then this guy, Mr. Manga Star, like just like, he like rockets out of the

1300
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,200
sky and is like, I'm here to show you how to become a Shojo manga artist with hot-blooded passion.

1301
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:12,720
And she's like, yay, but I'm so stupid. I can't do anything. And he just like beats her.

1302
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,280
He seriously beats the shit out of her and like sends her off to train with like other

1303
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,760
like famous Shojo manga artists who like give instructional, it's like an instructional book.

1304
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,720
And there's like, you know, they talk about their techniques for various things,

1305
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,320
and then she'll come back and he'll be like, Mr. Manga Star will be like, so, Hitomi,

1306
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,040
what did you learn from fucking, uh, uh, you, you, you Kako Isaka? And she'll be like, hmm,

1307
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,880
I learned. Oops, I forgot. And he'll just fucking beat the shit out of her and send her to another

1308
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,160
one. I want to make a quick add to everything I learned. I learned from Mr. Manga Star. Forget

1309
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,760
this is a guy. And, and I won't, I won't spoil the ending, but there is a heartfelt twist

1310
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,160
ending. I don't even know what that is. I'm totally serious. Yeah, there is a heartfelt twist ending

1311
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,800
that really makes you, that really recontextualizes the whole thing. Awesome. I won't spoil it.

1312
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,280
All right. So Tom is that Shojo beats Manga Artist Academy. Go find it. Tom, is that all of your

1313
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,160
influences? I have two more that there's m dot strange. He's a YouTuber and he did, he made

1314
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,600
three animated feature films by himself over the course of five years. That sounds like a cool

1315
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,360
rap name. M dot strange. He actually, he does do really horrible music as well. Awesome. So if you

1316
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,560
ever want to check that out. But I just got really, because before I watched him, because I found him

1317
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,280
like 2006 when YouTube like still didn't really exist. And like they have like featured videos.

1318
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,320
You remember those when they used to have like featured videos on the front page? He had a

1319
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,320
trailer for his first movie on there and it blew my mind to a million fucking pieces. First movie,

1320
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,520
he makes movies. He made three animated feature films by himself over the course of five years.

1321
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,760
Yeah. The first one. Wait, who's this? Jesus Christ. What a champ. Who's this? M dot strange.

1322
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:54,560
You can just, he's just youtube.com. Tom has done a review of one of his films. I don't think anybody

1323
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,160
watches your videos as much as I do, but I'm well aware of M dot strange as a guy who you even worked

1324
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:05,680
with at a time, right? Yeah, we talked a lot. I did help him do some animation for, he did a music

1325
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:11,920
video for my self-indulgence and I did some animation for him on that. Whoa, what the fuck?

1326
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,520
I never heard about that. Yeah. Tom has worked on an MSI music video. I do remember you. I do

1327
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,280
remember, I do vaguely remember your review of that. Yeah, he's super cool. He's like a total

1328
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,120
weirdo. Did you fully disclose that you have affiliations with him? Yeah.

1329
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,280
Collusion influenced by people you know. So, Tom, is that it? And then also this guy, Alec

1330
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:39,280
Longstreet, he does really personal slice of life, zine kind of comics things. I feel like

1331
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,440
bind and photocopy all of them in his house and then ship them out to people. Has he heard of

1332
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,640
the internet? He has, but it's like just checking. There's a weird underground indie scene where they

1333
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:55,040
still just do that hardcore old school way of doing things. That's cool. His thing is he just

1334
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,480
works on comics every day. He's done comics for like 10 years. He's done comics every day,

1335
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,160
that entire time except for like three days. He missed them because I used to watch his podcast

1336
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,840
that like they interviewed all these like indie guys and I was like super into him and he's like

1337
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,960
this is the coolest guy. He's super like positive and happy and shit and I met him at a convention.

1338
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:18,000
He was super chill. We talked for half an hour. So, yeah. Sounds like a hero. So, I think Jesse

1339
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,120
should go last and I believe I should go second last. Oh, I forgot you haven't gone yet. Oh my

1340
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:28,080
gosh. You're next to Vue. All right. Cool. I forgot about you. So, trying to co-opt my hosting

1341
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:32,560
duties. I know what order everybody's going in. All right. Well, let's see. My influences are here.

1342
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,800
The two that are in this chat in this call is Digi Bro and Jesse Wood because they both got me

1343
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,040
into making videos and stuff. Let's see. James Rolfe for obvious reasons. Hang on, Vue. I just

1344
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,880
want to ask when did you start making videos if they got you into it? Well, I mean, I first started

1345
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,680
making videos in 2008, but they were the ones really who made me want to do it as a career thing.

1346
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:54,240
Because it's just because you're a great editor, better than me, and it makes me mad all the time.

1347
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,360
Seriously? Maybe I'm faster than you. I guess like edits per minute, I'm better than you,

1348
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,160
but I don't think I have as much polish as you do. And you have like,

1349
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,120
you didn't make videos at all until like 2013. But whatever. I guess edits per minute, I'm pretty

1350
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,880
high, whatever. But yeah, I have. Well, anyway, I was just interested. Yes. So, yeah, it was really

1351
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:18,160
Digi Bro and Jesse. Oh, man, I said his last name. Ah, beep, beep, beep. Them doing their early

1352
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,800
horse cast episodes, constantly bitching about doing YouTube. And I was like, those are the kind

1353
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:31,440
of problems I want to have. And James Rolfe, not just for the idea of making videos, but also a

1354
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,040
lot of his writing style. I think he's like the best at conveying simple ideas or no, conveying

1355
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:42,480
obtuse ideas very simply. My brother, who's my number one comedic influence influence,

1356
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,320
because he's a very funny person. And we always iron out one another's comedy.

1357
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,240
And I assume he's a younger brother. Yeah, he's three years younger, three inches taller.

1358
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,120
Trey Parker and Matt Stone was early into me getting inspired to like, I always knew that art

1359
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,760
was going to be my career. But those people really, those guys lit a fire under my ass kind of because

1360
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,480
I heard about them constantly bitching about how hard it was. And it was really inspiring, you know,

1361
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:10,080
and South Park in general was a big influence for me. It was like my awakening to more complex

1362
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:16,640
ideas, you know, Rush Limbaugh. I take a lot of influence from him on how to convey ideas,

1363
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:22,480
how to present yourself as a person and not expect that one. Okay, how to how to like,

1364
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,880
be a personality, how to communicate with an audience to make the audience feel like you're

1365
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:34,000
talking to them. Okay, how to inspire people to kill everybody that you don't like. How to,

1366
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,960
how to like, like, be a persona, like his persona is very, he's got a persona. That's for sure.

1367
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:50,480
It's very similar to like an internet person. Wasn't Rush Limbaugh the villain in Biker Mice from

1368
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:57,360
Mars? I don't know what that is. You know what, he could actually be and I would have no idea.

1369
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,520
No, no, no, sorry, he was like a fish monster named Limburger. I think it might have been like

1370
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,560
Rush Limburger. Okay, okay. It might have been a pun. And also like his persona is very internet

1371
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,600
like like Maddox and Jimquisition even kind of reminded me in similar, in different ways,

1372
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,360
although I think Rush is a lot more interesting and fun than Jimquisition, but whatever.

1373
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,560
Yeah, I would say I would say I would think I think Rush Limbaugh has had more influence on me

1374
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:28,960
than any other one individual person who I personally know. Look, man, look, here's the

1375
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,200
problem of the arguments we've had. No, no, not that. But look, here's the problem. I can't

1376
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,960
recommend his show because it's a radio show. It's it's a half it's an hour and a half of show

1377
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,480
and an hour and a half of commercials. It's unlistenable. If you just released a one hour

1378
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,520
podcast once a week, everyone on the everyone I know would be super into it. He's really funny.

1379
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,920
It's just that the format of the show is dated and terrible, but hit the content is great.

1380
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,000
Just take my word for it. Okay, I'll believe I used to have a blue collar job. So it was a

1381
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,640
it was I was able to listen to that. Here you can eat my issue the way he animates the universe

1382
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:04,640
is the way I wish the universe could be. Movie Bob was really the beginning of me understanding

1383
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:10,480
the idea of like an intellectual thesis on things. Very interesting in that regard. And now he's

1384
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,400
and for a long time he's also been my counter influence of who I don't want to be.

1385
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,560
But I agree with his politics. I think that everyone is a fat neck beard and everyone should

1386
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,480
be ashamed for it, except for me. I should get fat and have a neck beard and be totally fine about

1387
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:31,520
it. Okay, Popeye also portrays the world. Not really the character so much as just the show.

1388
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,040
What about the character or the show? Mostly the show. No, the character himself. The real live

1389
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:44,240
Popeye. What the fuck is going on in here right now? Mostly the show. It also when I first watched

1390
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,680
Kill La Kill really, it reminded me of Popeye, the way it like abstracts the world in a really

1391
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,520
over the top energetic way. I thought that was really fun. I just I want the world to be like

1392
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,960
that. It's just a cool nice escapism that really is really nice and fun and everything bounces.

1393
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,680
Wow, this is a fascinating list so far. Let's see. I knew all this was coming too because I've

1394
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:08,320
seen his. This is exactly the kind of list I would expect from the movie. I love it. I love it.

1395
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,640
The little rascals, which was I think it's its original title is Our Gang. That's a really cool

1396
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:18,160
thing. That's an old film serial black and white series thing. And I think it got me into like

1397
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,600
long protracted comedy because at the time it felt pretty long. Are you talking about the show or

1398
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,920
like there was a movie little rascals that was in color? Right, I'm talking about the show. Yeah,

1399
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,840
that little film series thing. Yeah, I just I thought like because the situations are kind of long

1400
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,880
and protracted and I think that gave me a taste for that kind of stuff. The Marx Brothers obviously

1401
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,240
that got me into like slapstick and all that stuff. I have economic science written here because

1402
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,920
that really portrays the world in a way that makes a lot of sense to me. Economic science was a big

1403
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,000
influence. Yeah, you know, specifically, that's a that's a book. Well, there's that one book,

1404
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,640
basically economics with Thomas Stahl, which I was talking about, whatever, you know, a more

1405
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:58,160
interesting one was an episode of Planet Earth about rainforests and it talks and it shows this

1406
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:03,120
tree falling and how all the different plants try to get some sunlight. And I was like, that's what

1407
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,080
the world is like, you know, there's like something out there, like, whether it be money or like

1408
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,960
success or like friendship, there's always like a source of it and everyone rushes to get it. And

1409
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,360
that a big tree that tries to become huge is going to have a harder time than a little tree.

1410
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,200
That's why I guess that was part of why I was like, I don't have to become a millionaire doing

1411
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:40,160
something huge. I can be like a thousand air making YouTube videos and I will be more happy

1412
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,600
than a guy trying to get all this stuff. No, I totally am with you on that.

1413
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,560
Russia is a big rush when Bob, he lives that lifestyle and he loves everything about it,

1414
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,080
right, Ben? I love being dirt poor. I want to I want to make as little money as possible for me

1415
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,560
to survive on no work. If I can do that, then I've achieved everything I want. All right,

1416
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,120
adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, big influence on my slapstick sensibilities. I love that.

1417
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,520
Although I was a chili dog one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I rewatched some of it because I was

1418
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,600
trying to get a clip of it for my most one of my recent videos and it doesn't hold up that well,

1419
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:17,520
but man, very inspiring to me. Okay. Daft Punk, you know, because I don't know, maybe I have

1420
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,440
latent autism. So I'm really I was really into them when I was 14, you know, have they inspired

1421
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,720
you to stay up all night to get lucky? I don't know. I don't know if that was a joke or anything,

1422
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,400
but that was a good reference. Roger Vanderweet, the other YouTuber who really influenced me,

1423
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,960
Roger Vanderweet, who like introduced me to the concept of an analysis as distinct from a review,

1424
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,800
although he didn't introduce me to the word analysis. That's what Digibro did, but he really

1425
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,760
got me into the idea of... Wait, wait, sorry. Did he taught you the word analysis? Well, I knew

1426
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,680
the word analysis, but I never really thought of it as the word to use to describe what we do.

1427
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,600
You know? Okay. Roger Vanderweet just thinks of it as theories or something. He doesn't really

1428
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,440
know what word to use because English isn't his first language. His writing sucks. His animation

1429
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,600
sucks. His voice acting sucks. He really is just bad at everything. Everything sucks about this guy,

1430
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,680
but he's one of my biggest influence. But he's awesome. He definitely does more good than anyone

1431
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,560
else who sucks that much. He really is amazing. I love his thought process, the way he thinks.

1432
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,000
Like, he can make a blog about him moving out of his family's house and how everyone was fighting

1433
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,800
over the furniture, and it was fascinating. I was on the edge of my seat the way he wrote,

1434
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,960
even though every sentence had a typo. D'Vu, here's... D'Vu, I've thought about it a lot because I

1435
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,760
went and watched Sonic dissected and I didn't like it, but upon further reflection, I really think

1436
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:33,360
that where it failed for me was in not providing any context for someone who doesn't know the

1437
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,280
Sonic games to enjoy their thoughts that much. I didn't know the Sonic games that much, but now

1438
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:42,480
I practically know I can probably recite all of the main games in order, things to his videos.

1439
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:48,080
Very interesting. Like a Mr. B-Tongue video, like this video about Jango. I can enjoy that video

1440
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,600
without having seen Jango. I cannot enjoy Sonic dissect without having played Sonic. You didn't

1441
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,320
watch it, so that might make it harder to follow. In regards to that Mr. B-Tongue, I got into Mass Effect

1442
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,960
because I watched Mr. B-Tongue's video over and over and over and over again, and now I'm...

1443
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,120
Yeah, Mr. B-Tongue's been a really big influence, too, because I have like... There was like a whole...

1444
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,760
There was like a summer where I just was at work playing his videos like every day

1445
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,360
to the point that I was starting to almost trying to imitate, obviously not well,

1446
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,520
imitate his writing style. But yeah, Roger Grandeur, I love his train of thought. Every

1447
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,200
time I think, you know, this guy is just so bad and inconsistent, but then he comes out with a video

1448
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,720
that blows my mind. So yeah, I just... Like he recently came out with a 40-minute video analyzing

1449
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,320
his own 20-minute parody animation and just hearing his thought processes.

1450
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,600
So what you're telling me is even though he sucks in every way, he's the best guy ever.

1451
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,120
Yeah, pretty much. Okay. So like you?

1452
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:45,440
Yeah, let's see here. Mr. Bean, big influence on just like... I don't know, more comedic sensibilities,

1453
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,560
you know, more protracted situations. Didn't influence me on talking, though. I still talked

1454
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,960
way too much. And I got three more items left. Steve from Blue's Clues, big influence on me.

1455
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:06,480
I just want to point out, Davoo, you were giving me shit in the chat, in the text chat for talking

1456
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:12,000
too much. I got three items left to go. Steve from Blue's Clues, definitely the biggest influence

1457
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,040
on my persona, the way he talks, presents himself. Why would you pick him? It wasn't intentional at

1458
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:22,080
all. You see, the way my persona comes from these really unwatchable sketch comedies I did with my

1459
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:28,080
brother. And that was sort of a parody of like kid show hosts. But I realized it was just a parody

1460
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:33,120
of Steve from Blue's Clues. So that whole like, sort of like weird, like dozing off personality,

1461
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,520
really like that. Take a lot of influence from food, because if I have to make a metaphor for

1462
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,880
something, I'll use food, you know. Wait, wait, in what like, you want to act like food? Well, like,

1463
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,840
for example, a couple weeks ago... Do you have a food sauna? Well, let's see, a few weeks ago,

1464
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,680
Digi and Jesse were like making rap songs together. And I was like, I want to get down the action.

1465
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,040
I want to make a beat. What's something I can make a hamburger. So now they made a beat about

1466
01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:00,880
hamburgers, right? So I just always use hamburgers. Big influence on my artistic group. I've seen

1467
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,280
that before. You've listed food as a big influence. I mean, if you... All of this was on his chart.

1468
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,920
You know, I have flashbacks now to it. I remember, and I didn't, I thought it was playing real fast

1469
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,400
and loose with the concept of an artistic influence. Yeah, me and Ben discussed it. We thought like,

1470
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,960
okay, well, DeVu like has to eat food to live without it. He would die. He needs to be allowed

1471
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,120
to make stuff. Obviously, there's some connection here, but you're saying, okay. And the last

1472
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:28,320
influence is video games and the specific way of like, it's a way to like systemize life. Like,

1473
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,760
I wonder what's up with all those business guys who like making money, even if they don't like

1474
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,160
spending it? Oh, it's like an MMO. What's up with people who want to start a family? Oh, it's like

1475
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:40,960
a stimulation game. You know, so I just looked at through video games at the lens to process the

1476
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:48,080
variables of life and come to an understanding. I think it's more that those games just tap into

1477
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:53,600
the kind of, you know, desires in humans. Well, duh, it just gives me an understanding.

1478
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,320
Yeah. So, so I think you have, you have the chain of which resembles which reverse. Yeah, well,

1479
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:06,000
yeah, but not whatever. All right. I disagree. All right, Jesse, do you want to go next or should

1480
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,960
I go next? Oh man, can anyone follow DeVu? Yeah, like, damn, it's tough. Rush Limbaugh,

1481
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,240
a tree falling down, economic science and Popeye. Look, man, everyone who says anything

1482
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,440
you've ever heard about Rush Limbaugh is in the past year. These are the ingredients chosen to

1483
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:27,040
create the perfect DeVu. Look, man, I gotta say this, anyone who's ever said anything about Rush

1484
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,200
Limbaugh is someone competing for his time slots. They're not going to represent him properly. It's

1485
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,560
just that you can't listen to his show because it's a bad format. I have listened to Rush Limbaugh

1486
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,640
before and like, he does speak very well. We're not here to question your influences. All right,

1487
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:45,200
Jesse, do you want to go next or should I go next? Um, yeah, I guess I'll go next. Okay. Alrighty.

1488
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,360
I have influences. At least one.

1489
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,960
I'd like to hear it.

1490
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:02,480
What's happening?

1491
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,120
It's just, it's Jesse saying goddamn influence.

1492
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:10,720
Fucking no, these guys. You're like, you're like, uh, who is it? The Hulk, your favorite

1493
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:16,400
wrestler. I know. You like the Hulk. You're like, you're like Shredder from Ninja Turtles.

1494
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,520
Jesse, you made an enormous chart. I know, I'm looking at it right now as a matter of fact.

1495
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,720
I know you listed a bunch of influence at the end of Horseshoe.

1496
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,640
Yeah, I did. I bought a bunch at my base. That was a really cool thing. I love that.

1497
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,480
And now, and now Jesse's just looking at this chart and he's like, what the fuck?

1498
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:40,720
It's more like the chart is looking at me. It's going through me. Like in every one of Jesse's

1499
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,960
videos, he dumps references to stuff that he loves and all of them. And now he's not able to

1500
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,240
fucking articulate it. We can all do a better job. Let's go right now. No, I can tell from Ninja

1501
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,920
Turtles. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's what you jumped to. Of course. Like I thought you were

1502
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:01,280
going to be legit. Donatello, Commander Shepard, Vegeta, Goofy. There you go. There you go.

1503
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,000
Helga from Hey Arnold taught you, man, and you'll love. Yeah, definitely all my fucking

1504
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,840
waifus and daughter-ruiser on there. They're influential. Yeah. Okay. I was thinking about

1505
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,520
this lately or I think about this a lot. Yeah. I mean, is that there's a disconnect I feel

1506
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:24,480
between how my viewers view me and how I view myself because they all view me as like a reviewer,

1507
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,520
but I don't see myself as like, if I put the word review on a video, it's not really a review. It's

1508
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:37,200
usually just retardation. Yeah. I do not see you as a reviewer anymore. Like none of my influences

1509
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,280
are reviewers or critics. Like they're all like stand-up comedians or professional wrestlers or

1510
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:46,800
musicians or like fictional characters. Except for like AVGN. That's true. AVGN is a pretty good.

1511
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:53,840
And like Sean Baby was a big influence on my writing. Yeah. Yeah. The greatest writer on the

1512
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:59,840
whole internet, pretty much. Who is Sean Baby? Sean Baby used to write for EGM and now he writes

1513
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,240
for Cracked and he writes pretty much the funniest things that you can possibly imagine. Yeah. He

1514
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:11,520
has like their descriptions of shit. His, my favorite analogy that I've read of his lately

1515
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,560
is just like the writer of this show is the reason that they don't allow pregnant entrants

1516
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:27,120
and belly flop competitions. Oh, he wrote these guys. No, he is that guy. He invented that on the

1517
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:32,080
internet. I think his Twitter says that he invented being funny on the internet. Yeah. And it's kind

1518
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:40,000
of true. His Tumblr is Liartown USA where he just posts the best photo shops in the history of the

1519
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,120
world. Like, for instance, the what, how book of horse arson?

1520
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,520
Enough about Sean Baby, though. We got to get, Jesse has a lot of influences. No,

1521
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:01,200
fuck that. I want to talk about Sean Baby. Sean Baby's the, oh god. One of my favorites was,

1522
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:08,400
he was describing the Gamecube controller and he described it as having been vomited by a moon octopus.

1523
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:17,600
By the way, I went to his website just now and I see that on it is an advertisement for a

1524
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:27,120
make it yourself fuckable Easter fleshlight. I think I've probably read a bunch of his stuff

1525
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,280
if he writes for Cracked because it's a time where I read like every Cracked article and I can't

1526
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,000
even remember that some of them had amazing articles. He is the funniest guy on Cracked,

1527
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,760
period. That quote that I just gave you was from one of his Cracked articles.

1528
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:50,480
Oh god, he also was just like, this guy's such a liar. It's like fucking John Travolta telling

1529
01:31:50,480 --> 01:32:01,440
the guy on his dick that he's not gay. And then like he brings up John Travolta like 10 other

1530
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:10,160
times in that article. It's just like, you know, it's like John Travolta saying he genuinely

1531
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,840
doesn't know the gender of the guy on the other side of the hole in the menstrual.

1532
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:27,200
Okay, this guy rules obviously. Yeah, and like this is all related to, these are all metaphors

1533
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:36,240
related to how bad Superman is at hiding his identity from Lois Lane. And how Lois Lane's

1534
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:41,760
the worst fucking human being in the world. It's like, like 20 people died because you wanted to

1535
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:50,960
build a giant electromagnet to trap Superman, you fucking cunt. Oh god, and just his like he makes

1536
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:57,680
the funniest, funniest photo shops. My favorite, my favorite one that I remember is a book that's

1537
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:07,600
out or loud and allowed one bisexual man's struggle with society's acceptance of and

1538
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:19,680
total indifference to his lifestyle. So now I'm looking at my little influence map I'll go

1539
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:26,000
into like the comedians corner. Doug Stanhope is a big influence. I think you can probably see

1540
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,240
that if you watch him. He's his whole shtick is that he's a drunken slob but also occasionally

1541
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,880
profound. Yeah, that sounds like you. And then Norm McDonald who is like totally irreverent and

1542
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,560
like complete retardation. And and then George Carlin is obviously the biggest one. And the

1543
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:51,360
the biggest thing about George Carlin that influences me is that he knew dead. Yeah, my dream

1544
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:58,560
in life. George knew like when to be smart but he also knew that there was a place for being

1545
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:04,480
completely retarded. Like he's famous for like saying profound things and being like the thinking

1546
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,440
man's comedian. But my favorite George Carlin bit is the one where he comes up with like a new

1547
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:15,280
sports cheer and he goes this is a new sports cheer that you can say at like a football game.

1548
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:24,880
Ratshit batshit dirty old plot 69 assholes tied in a knot hooray lizard shit fuck

1549
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,800
it's just completely stupid and it's like and it's sandwiched between all this like really

1550
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:40,240
intelligent social commentary and then it's just hooray lizard shit fuck yeah I mean you gotta love

1551
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:44,880
how that I mean that you're so right that like that kind of completely retarded stuff juxtaposed

1552
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,360
against brilliance is like man it's such a potent potent potion you got there's too strong of a

1553
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:54,560
potion for me. I think the seven words you can't say on television is one of the single greatest

1554
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,880
just speeches of all time not even bits of comedy I don't know I don't get I don't get

1555
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,720
either I'm a huge fan of Carlin's uh thing about time it's from like when he was really young and

1556
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:10,320
he does the speech about how like time doesn't make any sense as a concept it's like yeah the

1557
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:15,600
planet is like the most philosophical humor I've ever heard. Anytime he talks about religion it's just

1558
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:24,960
incredible. I think with Jesse like if I could just uh you know compliment you for how Carlin

1559
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:32,080
like you are because I think you totally nail like his delivery of like rants where it's like

1560
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:38,160
he really does sound angry but it's still funny yeah like he he comes off as like he definitely

1561
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:43,840
legitimately cares about this he's never like flippant about it he's like I can't fucking believe

1562
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,880
I live in this fucking world you know but it's still hilarious the man was the man was a poet you

1563
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,040
know and then and then you would see like interviews with him like sort of offstage and

1564
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,760
out of character and he's like a totally chill guy and he you know yeah like he's like he saves it

1565
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:03,040
for his performance like all that I think one of the most Carlin-esque jokes that that I remember

1566
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:08,480
from you that I that that is the one that nobody laughs at because I get you just it was too like

1567
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:13,280
obtuse but at the start of the Hello Kitty review where you just do this like

1568
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,480
like it sounds like you're talking normally but you just make these name associations and it's

1569
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,760
like a whole minute of you just saying names that create this weird train of thought to connect

1570
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,560
back to Hello Kitty yeah it just sounds like nonsense yeah but when you like if you actually

1571
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:34,080
pay attention to it then it's like it all has a logical present one of his his later ones like

1572
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,880
later in his life his modern man bit which yeah that's the one that I was thinking of isn't even

1573
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,960
comedy it's not even a joke right it's just a poem that he wrote but because he's George Carlin he

1574
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:50,400
can do that on a comedy special and just like it's cool shit and I feel like whenever you do your

1575
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,440
your like whenever you describe yourself it's very much like that bit where you're like you know I'm

1576
01:36:55,440 --> 01:37:01,600
the the old school fool with that old school cool it's that makes a carlin and wwe wrestler dudes

1577
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:09,840
you know yeah um yeah the wwe wrestlers like or any wrestlers you know like wrestlers are like

1578
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:16,080
probably my primary influence on my comedy and my persona or whatever my performances wrestling

1579
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:23,040
promos and um I was thinking about this too because I made that fuck off video where I was

1580
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:30,080
railing against that shitty commenter right and um like the thought process behind that video was

1581
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,440
you know I've been thinking for a while that it would be fun to rail on shitty commenters in the

1582
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:38,080
video and I got a comment that was really shitty so I just said I'm gonna cut a promo on this guy

1583
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:44,080
and it'll be funny so I did that but like so many of the commenters were like I don't understand why

1584
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:49,040
you care so why it bothers you so much like they think that I'm like that I'm sitting in the shower

1585
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:54,320
like a rape victim about my commenters and like really stewing about this when in reality what it

1586
01:37:54,320 --> 01:38:00,880
is is I think I just I enjoy having an enemy that I can cut a promo on and it's just fun like it's

1587
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,200
it was fun to rail on that guy like because that's where my influences is it's perfect like Roddy

1588
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:12,480
Piper would like watch anyone who like if you do if people don't understand like what I'm doing when

1589
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:17,840
I cut promos on people are rail against commenters just watch like any Roddy Piper promo where he's

1590
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:23,360
just like insulting people in hilarious ways and going really off Jesse if I if I had watched

1591
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,400
wrestling as a child would I better understand what you're doing when you cut promos because when

1592
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,800
you because when you say things like this it makes me think that maybe I don't know what Jesse's

1593
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,880
actually going for well I think people take my anger like way too seriously I think I mean what

1594
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,840
you say I mean what you're saying right now is tell me that yeah I do but like shit I couldn't I

1595
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,560
couldn't tell that you weren't serious I don't want to know I don't want to know whether or not Jesse's

1596
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:54,480
actually angry when Jesse started up the drowning in kayfabe channel like because I never known anything

1597
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:59,360
about wrestling and then like as Jesse taught me about wrestling by like giving these long speeches

1598
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:05,200
about it it was like everything immediately made sense to me about Jesse's persona like every

1599
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:10,800
wrestling video I have ever watched that Jesse has sent me has made me go oh my god you did this

1600
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,440
like gross is something that you've been trying to do like the horse finale is literally the

1601
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:22,560
fucking CM punk pipe bomb made into a film you know it's like like don't get me wrong I am I am serious

1602
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,520
in the sense that like yeah dumb comments annoy me those these armchair psychologists on my comment

1603
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:33,440
section really do annoy me but I blow it up to 11 that's like what it's that's what performance is

1604
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:38,000
all about that it's fun because I get this this complaint too where people are like you can't take

1605
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,240
criticism or stuff when I respond to criticism and it's like no it's more that it's really interesting

1606
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:48,160
to me to respond in in kind like you know yeah it's like someone left a comment on your video and

1607
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:55,600
you then made an art piece out of that comment in a way exactly it's like when I was growing up I

1608
01:39:55,600 --> 01:40:01,360
didn't get WWE at all I thought it was gay uh and then I learned it was also uh for Jesse so you

1609
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:07,840
know what does that say about him it says that I'm super gay yeah yeah but yeah like yeah guys like

1610
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,920
I don't know what you thought would happen if you thought you would end bad comments forever no I

1611
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,240
thought I would make fun of a stupid guy and it would be awesome and hilarious and cool which it was

1612
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:20,640
yeah like I mean I was surprised that I ended up watching the full 15 minutes of that video when

1613
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:25,760
I started I was like oh it's gonna be one of those videos and then I watched the whole thing I was

1614
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:31,280
like it was one of those it's pretty riveting yeah I don't think I've ever stopped watching a Jesse

1615
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:36,960
video halfway through it's it's hypnotic oh bloody dead man I'm gonna have to take a while to get

1616
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:43,280
through I couldn't watch bloody dead man I did not finish bloody dead man because I stopped to go do

1617
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:47,520
something else in the middle of it because the last episode of a race came out and I had to watch

1618
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,960
it I didn't get I can't blame anyone for not finishing bloody dead man but at the same time I'm

1619
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:58,240
really proud that I made bloody dead man yeah that's good I don't get the wrong character I was laughing

1620
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,800
consistently through bloody dead man but it was around the part where like you started up the

1621
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,520
songs and everything and I was just like I yeah or when you were in that girl's live stream for

1622
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:14,240
like 20 minutes yeah well you got further than me yeah that video fucking sucks yes you all

1623
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,680
suck for not watching it and I take back what I said I don't blame you I do blame you I need to

1624
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,440
go back into your homework and watch the bloody dead man from start to finish so fuck you yeah

1625
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:27,600
I watched it but I didn't watch this one man Batman I can't believe it

1626
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:40,240
I made up for it by not finishing the other one okay okay um yeah the wrestlers oh my god are we

1627
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:50,640
gonna hit two yes we are yeah we're talking about my influences yeah all right all right let's not

1628
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:56,560
bring that into it yeah okay Roddy Piper was a great like improvisational insulter and he's

1629
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:01,200
really cool and funny and out of control and great and like frenetic or whatever I don't know

1630
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:06,560
frenetic is a real word but um energetic I think it would ever who cares CM punk is another one of

1631
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,520
the big influences because like CM punk like brought so much like fire and passion and anger

1632
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:17,440
and like conviction to everything he said like with CM punk nothing is ever like I don't like you

1633
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:23,680
and I'm gonna beat you up CM punk is you are the problem with this fucking world and I will kill

1634
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:29,200
you motherfucker like that's when I do stuff like that that's probably a little bit of CM punk in me

1635
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:36,320
macho man just said weird fucking shit and he had so much style and charisma and he was just like

1636
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,960
way out there and Mick Foley uh Mick Foley is probably my favorite of all of them in terms of

1637
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:46,640
like promos because I think Mick Foley uh dude love cactus jack mankind all of his monikers

1638
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,600
his different personas which is also a thing that I do I guess yeah bottom yeah definitely learning

1639
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,320
about Mick Foley there was this great article on like the attitude era yeah it was good about it

1640
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:02,640
and like reading about Mick Foley made me go like this must be where like not not just like not that

1641
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,720
all your characters are like that but like when you get into the really emotional stuff yeah

1642
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:11,920
the characters are really interacting with each other that's like I think is like the best actor

1643
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:18,480
that wrestling has ever had like Mick wouldn't just cut promos like I hate this guy and I'm gonna

1644
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:23,840
beat him up he would like draw from like real big emotions and like childhood trauma and like

1645
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:30,160
you know when Mick Foley was a little boy I ate a worm to try to impress these kids they laugh so

1646
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:37,040
I did it again oh Jesus but then rumor got around us as kids tend to make rumors and soon it wasn't

1647
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:43,920
Mick Foley ate a worm to make some kids laugh it was Mick Foley eats worms every day you think any

1648
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:50,640
girl wanted to kiss me after that you think I had a prom date that hurt JR that hurt my feelings

1649
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:57,200
and like that is JR you monster that is so awesome that's like the best promo ever I love Mick

1650
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,080
he has so much emotion and that's another thing that I get like people love to dismiss anything

1651
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:08,160
that you say on the internet by saying oh you're crying you're whining you just you're on the verge

1652
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:15,120
of tears because you're complaining about your comments like do you not understand what acting

1653
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:22,400
is yeah exactly like if you're fucking delivering a performance you convey emotion you dummies you

1654
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:27,760
you're dumb um I I just I just I couldn't I couldn't tell it was a performance because I'm such a good

1655
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:34,480
actor I'm so good I could not you know maybe maybe you're right maybe you're right you know I I too

1656
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:39,200
have a difficulty distinguishing when Jesse is being serious well because it comes from a real

1657
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:45,200
place you're just arguing for immersion in media and Jesse's I always understand you get immersed

1658
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:51,040
in his emotional plight and I enjoy being there I like to if you know it's taking emotions and

1659
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:56,160
turning them to 11 it's taking like a it's taking like a consistent minor annoyance and blowing it up

1660
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:01,040
to I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out in front of you people just to prove a point because I hate

1661
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:09,520
you you know all of us talk about how like wrestling influences you it like it it kind of makes sense

1662
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:15,600
of that whole um the fact that I kind of connect to you in my brain to Spoonie and the stuff that

1663
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,600
he makes except that you make stuff much more frequently yeah I think he sort of does the

1664
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:24,080
same thing yeah he's definitely obviously very wrestling influenced mm-hmm yeah like he always

1665
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:29,600
talks about like I think his his biggest influence is like Hulk Hogan and the ultimate warrior and

1666
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:36,800
that beef and like that that sort of amy style whereas you take the more natural um style but

1667
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:44,640
like a lot of the creators who I enjoyed on YouTube seem to take stuff from wrestling like

1668
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,960
Takahata one-on-ones a big wrestling fan and he uh you see that show up in how the team

1669
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,280
for star does DBZ a bridge and you could you could almost say that wrestling promos were like the

1670
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:01,920
precursor to YouTube it kind of they kind of are yeah um and like now that's coming full circle

1671
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,560
with the new day being a yeah the new day our youtube act like yeah like their gimmick essentially

1672
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:14,880
is that they're three fucking youtubers who also wrestled yeah um three dorks and it's great

1673
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:21,200
they're yeah they're jesse great guys talked about the macho man brandy savagery did talk about

1674
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:30,320
the macho man I ain't laid a lift out not today no sir no all right whatever it is all right I

1675
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:37,200
have a couple more uh the muppets are a big influence on my on my more cartoonish qualities I

1676
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:43,200
guess my more zany stuff the horse head stuff yeah I love the fucking muppets is that muppet

1677
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,760
related yeah I'm gonna say yes the muppets actually taught me to feel I was born a psychopath

1678
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:54,560
there you go there you go the muppets taught me to the muppets taught you to like stick a hand

1679
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:00,880
up your proverbial butt and fake emotions like the felt puppet you are I will never forget when

1680
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:07,680
Jesse described that he was on the flight to brony con in 2014 and he just started thinking

1681
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:14,480
about kermit the frog and just burst into tears trying the whole flight I think about kermit the

1682
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:21,120
frog so cute I don't think that any joke in the history of television has ever made me laugh

1683
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:27,600
quite as hard as the very first episode of the muppet show where kermit is drinking a glass

1684
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:34,560
like a milkshake out of a straw and the milkshake is slowly going down in the glass as he sips

1685
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,840
and he just turns to the camera and he says think about this for a minute folks

1686
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:47,440
holy shit that's that's brilliant wait what's the joke he's a puppet he can't drink where's it going

1687
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:54,720
yeah I think about this word that's oh my god I love it yeah that that that plane ride story

1688
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:59,360
because it's like it was my first time being on a plane or going to brony con and I was like

1689
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:04,640
being there to like be a celebrity and it was really like kind of overwhelming and I was on

1690
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,160
the plane just thinking about it and I was like looking out at the clouds and I started thinking

1691
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:15,920
about like you know I bet kermit would be really proud of me right now and then I started looking

1692
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:22,480
out at the clouds and I started thinking rainbows are visions illusions

1693
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,440
oh man this is this is making me tear up I came to really understand Jesse's like mindset of like

1694
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:37,200
how emotional you really get like because there's a lot of you know jokes and kayfabe and all that

1695
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:41,440
stuff about your videos it's like hard to parse and stuff but like when you told me that story I

1696
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:47,520
was like yeah Jesse like really legitimately cares about like these stories like not just in like an

1697
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:54,320
intellectual way but in like a he will cry just thinking about kermit kind of way you know kermit

1698
01:48:54,320 --> 01:49:00,000
kermit's like a surrogate father I mean like that that that shit is making me

1699
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,560
me

1700
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:18,320
weird owl is a huge influence on I've always been like a parody songwriter kind of guy like

1701
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,760
everything I do is a parody essentially yeah um yeah weird owl I'm sorry I don't have more to say

1702
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,240
about weird I think weird owls a bit of interest to me yeah yeah weird owls weird owls he's

1703
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:34,960
fucking weird owl he's the man he's he's very clean he invented comedy yeah that's right he invented

1704
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:43,040
comedy off the internet yeah yeah yeah um and then uh my two biggest like influences in terms of like

1705
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:49,600
my writing are Rod Serling and Hideaki ono I guess ono is more of like a directing than a writing

1706
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,920
but like Rod Serling from the Twilight Zone he was the narrator of the Twilight Zone he wrote like

1707
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:59,520
every episode almost yeah he was the greatest genius whoever lived one of the greatest philosophical

1708
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:05,280
minds in human history the narrator wrote the show yeah he I thought that was just a guy they got

1709
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:12,240
no he was his party it was it was his thing wow yeah and dang like that's how I can't

1710
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:16,880
fucking believe you like didn't know that he wrote the whole fucking show you like piece of

1711
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:24,480
track Rod Serling was like he was so human like his his stories had we're all like like sci-fi

1712
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:29,760
horror stories but they had this really human soul to them and that's like human center and like

1713
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,600
his narration I talked about this in my christmas video how like he was so good at like

1714
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:39,200
summing up the emotional point of something in like one or two sentences that was so powerful

1715
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:44,320
like that show it was like it was like the horror star trek you know it just got to it had an idea

1716
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,240
it got to the heart of it and it was fucking awesome the whole time Rod Serling is the coolest

1717
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:56,480
in short there's nothing mightier than the meek oh all right I'm moist yeah he's incredible he's

1718
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:02,160
the best guy who ever lived and uh Anno Keiaki Anno the director of Evangelion is a huge influence on

1719
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:08,000
me not just because I constantly talk about Evangelion not not just because you want to marry

1720
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:15,200
Asuka he wants to adopt Asuka and give her a real home oh god when people say Asuka I want to kill

1721
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:23,280
everything it's Asuka come on I oh yeah you're a fucking anime guy you're Azuka of course

1722
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:34,240
Azuka is really cool Shinji he really rules Shinji and Rei I really like Rei Rei

1723
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:43,360
all right anyway why is Ava influential yeah or Anno okay because Anno is like the best guy

1724
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:51,040
in the entire world ever in the history of art at in terms of conveying huge emotions through

1725
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:58,800
just his directing like if you watch like the end of Gunbuster when they see the message on the earth

1726
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:05,440
and they're flying in that moment like that is the end of what you're gonna do my Hogan video

1727
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:12,480
is so influenced by Anno like just it's like a wordless just the I I'm not I'm just sounds like

1728
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,800
I'm patting myself in the back here but I'm not I'm patting Anno on the back man for making me cool

1729
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,280
it's so weird to hear you reference Gunbuster like that I don't associate with you at all but

1730
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,360
yeah I mean that is Jesse said that he's he has he's had like a video written about Gunbuster

1731
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:30,000
forever I know but if you put it out that would change my perspective probably isn't it is there

1732
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,440
gonna be a best anime ever about Gunbuster I've got a aim for the top best whatever in the works

1733
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:43,520
already it's already written so hot dog yeah all right Jesse what else you got um yeah I guess

1734
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,480
that's fucking it I mean there's fucking yeah Maddox is there Maddox has always been an influence

1735
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:53,920
and lately his best buddy Dick Masterson is like equally as much of an influence yeah that's like

1736
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,440
an influence that I love Dick Masterson is a fucking hero a gentleman and a scholar

1737
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:04,480
he's a gentleman and a scholar he's so much nicer than Maddox he's such a much of a better you know

1738
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:08,560
he makes me realize that I was wrong for being influenced by Maddox all these years I should

1739
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,640
have been on the Dick Masterson train man this is really fascinating for to hear me praise you

1740
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,680
you should admit you're all you guys praise this yeah I should have written the dick just

1741
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:20,080
cuz I I just I listened to like two or three episodes now do not have this love for him I'm

1742
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,280
really looking for you guys have hyped him up so much dude can't wait to get into this dude my love

1743
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:29,440
for dick increases every day yeah yeah I like when I listened to the whole podcast I felt like I

1744
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,440
was kind of half and half but now that I'm re-listing to it I'm like I think I agree with Dick on

1745
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,840
everything it's just so much easier to agree with him it really is that his persona in the podcast

1746
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:43,680
changes a lot over it where he starts off really trying to be like flippant and he saw it as like

1747
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,960
this is a comedy show this is like we should be in character and then over time it's really around

1748
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:54,800
like episode like in the 30s or so and they really start like every episode is a huge social issue

1749
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:59,040
that it becomes that like the facade kind of drops and uh it's kind of inevitable with every

1750
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:04,640
discussion even early on he's complaining about things like too much swearing right what a fucking

1751
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:10,240
he's kind of a big trash yeah he's even when he was trying to be like his satirical character

1752
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:16,240
all right so I guess I'm going last uh thankfully saving me for the end has made me really have

1753
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:23,600
to piss so now I'm gonna try to go faster just so I can piss at the end of this all right so Jesus

1754
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:28,640
man where do I even start though because like for me I guess the first big influence on like what I

1755
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:34,880
do now is magazines like reading magazines when I was a kid because uh you know growing up I was

1756
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,360
really obsessed with everything I got into it was like I was super obsessed with Beast Wars for a

1757
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:44,640
while and then Power Rangers and then like Godzilla and the Lost World and then Pokemon

1758
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:49,840
and like when I got into Pokemon I would I just get everything related to it you know I'd buy like

1759
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,600
there's a magazine with Pokemon on the cover I gotta have it you know so I had like all these

1760
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:59,680
Beckett Pokemon collector magazines oh god I had those things yeah those are awful uh I had their

1761
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:05,840
DBZ collector too god yeah I've seen some of those yeah and and Beckett Yu-Gi-Oh collector

1762
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:11,280
which they came out with every uh so I had an intellectual publication I had all these Beckett

1763
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:17,120
Pokemon collectors and then my mom had gotten us a subscription to Nintendo Power because it came

1764
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:22,960
with like a free uh Pokemon trading card game for the Game Boy like um it came with that so she

1765
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:27,040
she got a subscription for that purpose and then like so I had Nintendo Power coming in all the

1766
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:31,040
time and this made me into a huge Nintendo fanboy just because I was like you know reading the

1767
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,560
propaganda essentially but it was funny because I didn't really like reading at the time so I

1768
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:42,400
didn't really read these magazines so much as like really take in their structure and like the

1769
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:48,320
and the like the meta elements of it so I loved that every every magazine would open with like

1770
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:53,680
they'd have the letters from fans and then they'd have the like top 10 lists where like fans had

1771
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:58,720
voted on what were their top 10 games like Nintendo games and stuff um you know then they'd have like

1772
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:02,960
a fan art section and then they'd get into the articles and be like big features and the small

1773
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:08,960
features send an email to players pulse because I sent a couple I sent a couple of those I was

1774
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,520
I was a big Nintendo power fan too but yeah but yeah and then they had the reviews at the back

1775
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,240
and I was really into like I wouldn't like read the reviews per se but I'd look at the scores and

1776
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:22,320
like and I when I say that I don't mean that I was looking at the scores to like make a judgment

1777
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:27,520
on what the game is but I was fascinated with the idea that there was like the highest scored game

1778
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,160
because at the time it was like Ocarina of Time in Perfect Dark had like when I first read the

1779
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:37,520
magazine they had a percentage system and it was like 98 percent for Ocarina of Time and 96 percent

1780
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,400
for Perfect Dark and like no other games were close to that so I was like really fascinated with

1781
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:46,960
this idea that there was like the best game and that it was somewhere out there you know and so

1782
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:52,880
like a lot of my obsession with lists and scoring system and like systems and like looking at other

1783
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:57,520
people's lists and trying to figure out like what are the most highly valued things a lot of that

1784
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:03,120
comes from Nintendo power and um and I would just look at these all the time and I had a bunch of

1785
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:09,120
other magazines over time like uh once I got into video games I had EGM um when I got into anime

1786
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:15,440
there was anime invasion which later became anime insider so I remember reading all of those we read

1787
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:19,920
a lot of the same magazines as kids um yeah well we're probably about the same well I'm a little

1788
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,720
older than you yeah you're a little older so I picked up anime insider when it had become anime

1789
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:30,400
insider yeah um well funnily enough I had this was a huge part of how I got into anime was that

1790
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:35,040
like because I've been into Pokemon for a long time and I was kind of waning interest you know

1791
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:40,800
nobody cared about it that much anymore and I've been into it for like four years and then uh like

1792
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,840
my my cousin and I discovered anime and then my cousin picked up the first the first ever issue

1793
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,800
of anime invasion and he was like there's this thing called anime and it's like it's all like

1794
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:56,240
ninja scrolls it's a Japanese colloquialism yeah yeah anime a Japanese colloquialism and I was

1795
01:57:56,240 --> 01:58:02,480
like whoa and so uh it had it had um Goku on the cover like Kid Goku and like their their big cover

1796
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,880
story was like all the stuff that was uh left out in the American version of Dragon Ball because

1797
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,640
they had censored it you know so it's like talking about how Goku used to pat everybody's crotch

1798
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:14,480
and stuff like that to see what gender they were and how that was cut out it was just like a huge

1799
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:19,360
list of everything that was cut out all the like how they changed the the hell to fulfill the home

1800
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:24,400
for infinite losers yeah so it was all just like explaining all these cultural differences between

1801
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:31,600
uh like you know what was acceptable in Japan versus here but like yeah in this magazine like

1802
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:35,760
it just so happened that like adult swims started at the same time so like we were watching anime

1803
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,120
there and I read this magazine cover to cover like I read every single thing and when I say that I

1804
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:46,000
mean like you know the credits they'll have in a magazine like I read all the credits like I

1805
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:51,360
really wanted to know everything possible about anime and so then from like from there

1806
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,440
I would say my next big influence would be like forums because I discovered forums through Yu-Gi-Oh

1807
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:01,600
and like I started using internet forums big time and that's where I started seeing like people

1808
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:07,760
you know sharing different opinions about stuff and uh so I would get in on these forums and you

1809
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:13,280
know share my opinion but I was always like this bratty kid who was like off the handle and I was

1810
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:18,240
always like uh you know I cared about my opinion I didn't really care about other people's opinions

1811
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:22,960
so like really being on a forum wasn't that good of an idea because a forum is about

1812
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:27,760
discussion ostensibly I mean most people just kind of post past each other like they don't read

1813
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:32,640
each other's posts they all just share their opinion and move on yeah but like uh it made me mad

1814
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:37,920
that people weren't discussing my posts in the forum because like to me the point was I posted

1815
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:42,080
here so that you would respond to it and then no one would respond you know partly because I had a

1816
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,320
bad attitude and terrible writing skills but then um so I was bouncing between forums and I ended up on

1817
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:54,240
the megatocchio forums which is a webcomic that just happens to have a bunch of really really

1818
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:00,240
intense anime fans in its forums and I learned from all of them and they all had anime blogs so

1819
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:04,240
I started following other people's anime blogs and sort of like copying the formulas that they

1820
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:08,960
were doing where most of them were either episodic bloggers or they talk about like more general

1821
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,000
stuff related to a show or like just what they were watching at the time so I would like copy

1822
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,360
their styles and I was really attracted to blogs because of the fact that everyone has to respond

1823
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:24,960
to your point like it's not a discussion where everybody's equal it's you raise an idea and

1824
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,600
then people respond to your idea which is sort of how youtube is as well and like all the stuff

1825
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:36,640
that we do so it's kind of like it elevates it to to an artistic place you know it's not about

1826
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:41,520
everyone's we're all just a bunch of do you know that's very funny I want to bring up something

1827
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:46,480
from before my whole life Ben can attest to this whenever I've like been reading a new chapter

1828
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:51,040
of one piece or whatever nobody around me ever gives a shit and yet I want to tell them like

1829
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:55,760
endlessly about what happened and why it's so awesome so the channel I have now is pretty much

1830
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:00,640
just like the result of channeling that feeling into a thing yeah people have no choice but to

1831
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:06,640
listen or exactly off which is yeah the amount of time I spend rambling to my siblings and parents

1832
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:10,160
and friends about all the things they're going through my head has reduced significantly ever

1833
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:15,520
since I got on youtube yeah and I think that's probably something that's like innate in people

1834
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,720
doing stuff like what we do yeah we're translating we want people to hear it you know and for me a

1835
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:24,960
lot of that was because of the fact that growing up most people weren't into the stuff I was into

1836
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:30,400
so like trying to justify my interests was a big part of you know growing up for me where it was

1837
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:35,680
like I was into all this stuff that no one cared about and I'm trying to explain yeah why I care

1838
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,680
about you were talking about how like a lot of reviewers especially and analytical ones get a

1839
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:45,040
lot of flak for not representing populist opinions and you were theorizing that that that having

1840
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,360
our skewer random different opinions is what motivated them to want to start sharing their

1841
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:54,080
opinions more than anyone else exactly yeah like that's why I that's why it's so important to me

1842
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:58,720
to make like like my k on video where like other people don't seem to understand the appeal of

1843
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:04,400
this show so it's very important to me that I have a video explaining why I feel the way I do

1844
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:09,120
so that people aren't constantly making posts like they always do like really k on's your favorite

1845
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:14,080
and it's like yeah here's the two hours of reasons you know like that's that's kind of like the place

1846
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:19,520
that all of this comes from but in terms of like influencing my actual writing style because like

1847
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:26,560
so once I started up my blog my style was just completely rambling off the cuff like no structure

1848
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:32,560
no anything it was always um stream of consciousness you know and like I thought that was super cool

1849
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,680
because I was really into like writers and stuff who were like very postmodern and who didn't give

1850
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:44,640
a fuck about like formalism and stuff like that you know so uh I a huge influence on me has always

1851
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:50,400
been boogie pop the book boogie pop and others because it's told anachronically it's like five

1852
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:57,120
big chapters and each of them is a different part of one story but like each doesn't know anything

1853
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:00,480
about the other person's part so basically

1854
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:12,240
so anyway catch you up here guys come on I I uh there's a giant dick flying into my

1855
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,080
moon

1856
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:24,160
all right so this this book is told out of order and I thought it was really fascinating the way

1857
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:28,800
it's like each character is telling their perspective on this story and I've always loved like

1858
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:33,120
doing experimental out of order stuff also like quentin tarantino films how they're out of order

1859
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:38,000
and stuff so like um you can see some of that in my videos where I feel like everything is

1860
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:44,960
contributing to this one big narrative like to me you have to whoa what your videos don't have

1861
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:49,600
a no they have a the series ones definitely do you know I think everyone's videos inherently

1862
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:54,240
have a narrative and I don't think you can really I don't think you can appreciate someone's

1863
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:59,200
content until you understand who they are like if you read a roger ebert review and he shits on a

1864
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:04,160
movie and you're like but I liked that movie it only really makes sense to you once you understand

1865
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:09,680
his taste and you understand like where he's coming from like roger ebert gave like one star

1866
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:15,440
to kick ass it's like the reason is literally that he's old and he felt like he was too old

1867
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,000
for the movie you know we're like a 20-something guy would have a totally different perspective

1868
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,040
and if you you know if you read that article knowing that he's a 75 year old man it makes a

1869
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:30,080
lot more sense you understand the narrative of who he is and so I write all of my videos from

1870
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:34,640
the perspective of the more of these you watch the more sense this will make you know and that's

1871
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:39,360
why I constantly try to like call back to my old videos or remind people that I've made old videos

1872
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:44,320
you're like hey here's all the like when I people are accusing me of being too negative and I'm like

1873
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:48,720
here's the 95% of my videos that are positive go watch them because it's kind of important to

1874
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:52,080
understand you know they're interested that what have you done for me lately

1875
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:58,080
mentality you know that's yeah well yeah that's that's the only right that's right as far as I'm

1876
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:04,800
concerned yeah so so I you know I think that having a narrative across your stuff is important

1877
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:10,560
and to me like seeing stuff that that is kind of like a bunch of pieces that become a whole like

1878
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,400
it's the kind of stories that I've always been really interested in and and I tried it there's

1879
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:19,040
some of my videos standalone complex other yeah the standalone complex as I would later come to

1880
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:23,680
call it because it goes to the shell where you know each individual story is a part of a of a

1881
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:30,800
bigger grand narrative so so but as a writer I was terrible and I just I didn't spell check my stuff

1882
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:36,480
I just ran through it and I had this I had this very entitled attitude like it made me mad that

1883
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:41,040
no one read my stuff even though I wasn't doing anything to make it readable you are you are

1884
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:48,400
describing me on forums to a T and I yeah I learned to write basically because people on

1885
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:54,880
forums kept giving me shit for not capitalizing things and finally I was like fuck it fine I

1886
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,520
remember seeing on deviant art doing like comic strip stuff and like just like doing desktop

1887
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:04,080
background art and being like okay I need to calculate how to get popular that I calculated

1888
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:08,560
the top ways to get popular the second way to get views is to make comments on other people's

1889
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,600
stuff but then I realized the number one thing to do is to make good art and I was like oh right

1890
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:18,560
yeah I've actually recently put that pretty low on the list if you're just getting views these days

1891
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:24,560
but yeah well on deviant art having good art is important no yeah I didn't understand I didn't

1892
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:29,760
understand how to make good art and I just thought that like people had like I just thought that if I

1893
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:35,680
had my stuff spread out enough eventually like if I cast a wide enough net people will find it like

1894
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:40,160
the people who will appreciate this will eventually find it and what I didn't realize is that no one

1895
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:46,000
will appreciate this because it's terrible you know like there's no one for whom this is great art

1896
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,800
so like you know my writing was pretty bad and then finally I started like because I you know

1897
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:54,880
posted a lot in the animation is this really your influences thing this is like your whole story

1898
02:06:54,880 --> 02:07:00,080
yeah this is important you didn't expect this to happen yeah yeah it's important to the influences

1899
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:05,200
I know what I planned this all right I know what I'm talking about because I was talking to other

1900
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:11,440
people in the community and because I was bad eventually people found me who's who taught me

1901
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:16,880
that I was doing everything wrong so I got these bloggers these other bloggers who like I would

1902
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,600
you know comment on their stuff and I'd be like why is no one reading my shit and they were like

1903
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:26,160
you're you're terrible they're like you're not spell checking anything you write nobody wants to read

1904
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,880
something that's all spelling errors nobody wants to read this or that and so like meeting these

1905
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,840
bloggers like uh like ghost lightning who would go on to be like my biggest influence

1906
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:41,200
which is why this whole story was important is uh like they they were literally telling me what I

1907
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:46,160
was doing wrong they were like well the attitude you take because I had this very confrontational

1908
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:50,400
attitude like my opinion's the only one that matters fuck everybody else and it's like

1909
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:54,720
you want comments and you want people to discuss your ideas but you keep telling people that their

1910
02:07:54,720 --> 02:08:00,560
ideas don't matter and like you know pushing them away so ghost lightning taught me about

1911
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:06,800
the way that he acts is he said I am extremely arrogant and I really really like think that

1912
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:14,160
I'm great but I never tell anybody that I put on this persona of being humble and it makes people

1913
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:21,440
respect me but I know how to like defend myself when people attack me you know and it's just very

1914
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,160
Captain Picard mindset is the way I would describe it like he's the character who represents

1915
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:30,720
this the best where Captain Picard never puts on errors he never makes himself out to be amazing

1916
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,240
but he will always be the guy like when when it comes down to authority he's like look I know

1917
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:41,520
what I'm fucking doing you know and uh and will be that guy so that kind of mind and that's the

1918
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:46,240
reason I love Picard so much is that he reminds me of like ghost lightning and uh and my dad also

1919
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:50,720
has a similar attitude that he's developed over time like of recognizing that that's how you reach

1920
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:58,000
people is by you know saying you're not wrong but uh I'm also right you know yeah yeah so it's

1921
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,080
hard to argue with Picard yeah and and ghost lightning had this way of doing stuff where he

1922
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:06,640
would answer every comment that he got he would respond to everybody no matter how asinine the

1923
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:10,880
comment is because it would make people in turn improve their comments which I keep telling people

1924
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:15,040
is like the way to go if you want better comment sections let them know that you're reading it

1925
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:19,760
and then it makes them self-conscious about what they're writing so and in general he was just

1926
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:24,720
really fucking good he was someone who had you know studied he was like a long time english and

1927
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:31,520
literature major um so he was like really into deep reading and deep into philosophy and stuff

1928
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:37,200
like that so just generally talking to ghost lightning like taught me so much about the world

1929
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:42,400
and like brought in my perspective so much um you know I came to visit him for a month uh in the

1930
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:48,800
Philippines where he lives and he literally like read me a book on literary theory he was like here's

1931
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:52,880
a bunch of like you're gonna know all these terms now that people use you know it's like now I know

1932
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:57,040
what postmodernism is and what feminist theory is and like all this stuff that you know I learned

1933
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,880
from this literary theory book and then he would just explain to me all these like really deep

1934
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:05,680
philosophical concepts you know gave me a lot of reading material to to learn so that's why I always

1935
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:11,360
describe him as my mentor because like not just that reading his blog did influence me and I was

1936
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:17,280
also influential to him because like the biggest thing that I taught him was how to like make stuff

1937
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:22,800
fast because I've always been super prolific like just by nature I like things to come out as fast

1938
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,920
as possible as soon as I've had the idea and um you know he was more like the kind the type who

1939
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:32,880
would worry about like uh is this finished or not and I was like just publish stuff dude like

1940
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:37,280
I because I want to read it that's an influence you've had on me lately that was something I was

1941
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:42,160
always I was always slow to get stuff done and it made me realize just do it fast and it'll actually

1942
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:46,720
better than if you worked really hard sometimes well because Andrew Hussie Andrew Hussie taught

1943
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:51,440
me that you gotta fucking churn it out and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if any one

1944
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:56,800
particular drawing is shit you just put it out and I'm gonna get to Hussie too because like

1945
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:02,320
at this point can we please hurry this thing along I'm dying here this fucking this is literally

1946
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,600
digi bros draw my life Jesse Jesse and I just like how did he was like 30 minutes

1947
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,520
everyone has to hurry up so digi can get to his grand narrative as much as 12 minutes guys it was

1948
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:18,560
just I was talking about you pussies this is the best podcast it should go for five hours

1949
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:25,520
you can look at the waveform whoever edits this my whole my whole segment was like 10 minutes and

1950
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:32,080
then like two minutes of follow-up that was a fair enough whatever I did I take it away so I I was

1951
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:36,960
really impressed by these bloggers these guys who taught me how to write you know this is the most

1952
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:40,000
like all of this was the most important part after this is just going to be like a list all

1953
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,720
right that was all the stuff that was like the big huge okay I was just really afraid that everyone

1954
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:51,360
of your influence is going to include the influence of how I like became a writer that I am now

1955
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:58,080
like that these people's like that the mindset and the attitude of why I started writing combined

1956
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:02,480
with the way that people taught me what to do and then said like here's what you should do and then

1957
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:08,560
from then on it's just been like I love taking other people's styles and deliberately writing in

1958
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:13,680
their style and I feel like it's it's kind of like a like a power stealing thing like I eat you and I

1959
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:19,440
gain your powers like yeah that's kind of my mindset towards other content creators like mega man

1960
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:23,520
yeah you'll see it all that's yeah exactly like mega man you'll see it all the time on my channel

1961
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:28,000
where I go out of my way to do another person's style for like one video and then like whatever

1962
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:33,280
elements of it I like I incorporate forever so like your anime sucks videos are a huge

1963
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:38,240
send up of your movie sucks yeah I did a should you watch in the style of demolition d I've done

1964
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:44,240
tons of stuff where I took elements of Jesse's work Jesse's probably the biggest influence on me

1965
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:50,080
as a video maker in terms of like like not a writer but just as how I make videos by the way

1966
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:55,840
just keeping score that is now for people in this call that excited me as a direct influence so

1967
02:12:55,840 --> 02:13:00,800
anyone right anyone of you watching who doesn't think that I'm the shit now you know that I am

1968
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:07,840
truly the shit Jesse what is the shit Jesse's biggest influence on me was like um deciding to

1969
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:12,960
try to incorporate more like emotional factors into the videos like thinking of it more as an

1970
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:19,440
artwork you know um thinking of it more as like yeah I am doing something that's special and new

1971
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:24,960
and different you know and like looking at Jesse's work in particular just like thinking about how

1972
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:30,080
it relates to other people where uh we had this discussion the other day that like YouTube um a

1973
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:36,320
lot of it like doesn't have a lot of self-respect necessarily I think a lot of YouTubers like

1974
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:40,560
want to be filmmakers or they want to be doing nothing that pisses me off more than the fucking

1975
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:45,120
you to like John Trine is the perfect example we know he's dying to get on tv he'll do whatever

1976
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:50,800
it fucking takes well he just he wants he wants his stuff to look like like television as opposed

1977
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:56,160
to looking like YouTube and I think Jesse's art suffers as a result it's right I think Jesse has

1978
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:02,480
done the most to like elevate YouTube as its own medium that has its own message that it can send

1979
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:06,960
where like the way he's used his multiple channels the way he's used the ongoing narratives in them

1980
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:12,720
like is something that you couldn't do necessarily elsewhere like it is a unique story to YouTube

1981
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:18,960
that has a an interesting point to it and so like that's kind of made me start to look at YouTube

1982
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:25,680
as like what can I do that is distinctly this medium um and I I used to love John Trine so much

1983
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:30,880
for how he used his whole house compared to like yeah yeah like AVGN would do that he was really

1984
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,520
creative like I have a whole vlog planned about John Trine that I'm finally gonna do probably

1985
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:40,160
maybe tonight I just gotta get this out there about how he he's misunderstanding the the medium

1986
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:45,520
of YouTube and but um and now he's got these fake sets it's it'd bring in a fucking horse for the

1987
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:51,520
joke that he brought in a horse wow 10 out of 10 joke writing John Trine you're really elevating

1988
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,920
the media but yeah everyone everyone's had little bits of influence I've I've done I've written stuff

1989
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:00,720
to be like hippo I've written stuff to be like uh to be like Nate in smaller ways I've written

1990
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:08,320
stuff to be like you know everybody um even me I don't know about writing like you but uh not not

1991
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:13,760
me because uh you've only known me for like seven months so right but like there's a there's a lot

1992
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:19,040
of YouTubers who have copied the the biggest ones who got me to go onto YouTube were uh ego raptor

1993
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:23,600
and uh errant signal because ego raptor taught me that that you could do this in video and then

1994
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:28,880
errant signal taught me that you could do this lazily in video yeah that you don't have to animate

1995
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:34,000
everything and make it funny you could just do an analysis so I hope that I realize that one day

1996
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,640
yeah mr. Plinkett's obviously a huge influence uh just all the great everyone who's in my

1997
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:44,240
subscriptions if you if I'm subscribed to somebody I've probably incorporated some small element of

1998
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:48,640
their style into mine yeah you know I've got a video coming up that's gonna be like somewhere

1999
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:53,360
every frame of painting was big if you you can see the moment like you can also find the moment I found

2000
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:57,440
each of these guys because there will be a video that's like them right afterwards like right after

2001
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:03,120
every frame came out I did all these videos about visual uh like style in anime like just like I've

2002
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:07,040
got really focused on visuals for a while and then I've got one coming up that's kind of like

2003
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:11,920
somewhere between every frame and nerd writer but like yeah I love assimilating other people's

2004
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:16,560
stuff and then like turning it into my own and I think that what the reason I consider like the

2005
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:22,960
asterisk war series to be like my first real masterpiece is that it wasn't copying any one

2006
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,120
person but it kind of took everything I knew everything I'd learned and like put it into one

2007
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:32,640
place yeah so it was like the ultimate here's everything I've got as a youtuber right now

2008
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:39,840
and let's throw it all into one video um and then work ethic Andrew Hussie is my biggest influence

2009
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:44,880
and uh I've always said that if I ever had a wall of heroes because the uh my little pony

2010
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:50,320
writer M.A. Larson has behind his desk he has pictures of all of his like his favorite writers

2011
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:54,640
and all the people who he like looks up to and he calls it like his wall of heroes and I always

2012
02:16:54,640 --> 02:17:01,040
thought I just want to have Andrew W.K. and Andrew Hussie the two Andrews because Andrew W.K. has

2013
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:07,280
the mindset of everything is great like his he he describes everything as a party in his world

2014
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,720
everything is a party but if you follow his twitter it's like by the way two days ago Andrew W.K.

2015
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:17,840
formed the party party oh that's just a bit of news okay if you if you followed his twitter there'd

2016
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:23,120
be times where Andrew W.K. would say things like just pissed on my hand life is fucking awesome

2017
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:30,800
you know it's like that mindset of like no matter what it is it is awesome like is very much how I

2018
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:36,320
try to view the world as like even though some stuff is like fucking terrible it still is interesting

2019
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:41,120
and informs you in a way what does this man do is he a musician yeah Andrew W.K. was originally a

2020
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:48,160
musician and he has later turned into like a just a weird personality that exists in the world um

2021
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:54,400
he's done all kinds of shit but his first album is fucking great uh the album I Get Wet and uh

2022
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:58,880
yeah so I love his attitude but then Andrew Hussie has the work ethic and there were other

2023
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:03,440
people who inspired me like uh like just hearing about Stephen King I never actually read any of

2024
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:07,760
his books but I know that he was the one who said like if you're a writer all you should be doing is

2025
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:12,000
writing like you know that's like how if you want to get good at writing just write all the time

2026
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,320
you know it's what he said but Andrew Hussie had the most inspirational quote to me where he said that

2027
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:23,280
Homestuck is not a work of art to him it's just a way of life like he doesn't do anything else

2028
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:28,320
he was like all I do is I write Homestuck and I put it out and it's not like I'm doing it to

2029
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:33,680
create this one thing like this this this thing that you know is meant to be read just and by

2030
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,400
itself he's all like it's just what I fuck bitches and write Homestuck and I'm all out of bitches

2031
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:43,440
he also he also said that it's his chief leisure activity yeah that's like that's great but it's

2032
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:49,520
all he does like and the the production rate was so insane like for the first year of Homestuck

2033
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:55,440
coming out it was five posts a day every day and it would never stop you know and then like it only

2034
02:18:55,440 --> 02:19:00,160
started slowing down because of the fact that he sold out to that damn video game but he it only

2035
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:04,080
started slowing down because the things he was doing would take longer like he would always say

2036
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:07,760
every time there's a gap in Homestuck it's not because I'm not writing Homestuck it's because

2037
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,560
the next update is that much larger so like you know Homestuck would go down for a month and then

2038
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:17,200
and a full fucking animation would come out or a video game would come out as one of the chapters

2039
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:22,000
you know like there's never a time where he just stopped and was like I'm gonna take a break because

2040
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,720
he didn't view it as work he viewed it as a lifestyle he viewed it as this is what I like doing

2041
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:31,840
you know so that's what a kind of mentality that I like to have about my work as well as like

2042
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:36,720
there's no sense in me being like oh I need a break from YouTube because it's like YouTube is

2043
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:43,120
all I want to be doing you know so like I feel the same way I feel the same way I just have like

2044
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:49,680
crippling self-doubt I feel the same way to that yeah so yeah those are my uh those are my influences

2045
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:56,480
the major ones so yeah I feel the same way to holy sh I wanted to say by the way that uh upon

2046
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:00,800
listening to yours did you I reflected on it myself and I realized that there is probably the biggest

2047
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:06,720
influence out of all of these that I didn't even mention and it's specifically 4chan uh yeah I mean

2048
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:10,720
I know that's gonna you know people are gonna think that's retarded but well your sense of humor is

2049
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:15,520
very clearly yeah oh yeah for sure just for my last video people or whatever it was people yeah

2050
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:20,560
it's a real disadvantage but you know it's it's really changed uh the way I talk the way I write

2051
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:24,640
I mean when I when I talked about how I will you know just yell at people like the things that I

2052
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:28,560
think are awesome and they'll try to stop listening that's what 4chan is for me now that's where I

2053
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:32,480
do that like when you have a conversation with someone you just hold up a picture and hold it

2054
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:37,600
next to your conversation that you're having for an epic reaction meme lol love them yeah that's I

2055
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:42,560
don't know just I would cite 4chan as an influence as well on the way I think and like interact with

2056
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:49,600
stuff yeah yeah I think 4chan has influenced like how all internet media works yeah that's true

2057
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:55,520
that's for sure I think 4chan has halted human advancement forever and doomed us as a community

2058
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:01,280
outside looking in my friend you just don't get us you just don't get it you you just don't get

2059
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:05,440
why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch and by the way I think the most important thing

2060
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:11,040
that 4chan teaches the world is how to like be investigative like 4chan really is all about like

2061
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,720
it's a great aggregator of information so it really encourages you to go out and find things

2062
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:18,960
yeah it encourages you to like because their whole policy is like no hand holding and stuff

2063
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,200
and no spoon feeding and like they go too far with it to an extent that it's kind of stupid where

2064
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:28,080
they're like clearly showing you something that they know you don't know what it is well listen

2065
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:32,480
to fuck with you sometimes it's an aggregator of information but it's also an aggregator of stupid

2066
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:36,560
dummies how you say that it's just I don't know it's just a community of like minded people really

2067
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:41,840
people to like learn how to find stuff and learn how to like investigate and learn how to like

2068
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:46,880
you know find things for yourself I get bothered sometimes when I I know some people who will

2069
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:52,400
like ask me shit that I know they could find the answer to like in 10 seconds yeah but because they

2070
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:58,080
know I know the answer they just ask me but I'm like I have the I have the 4chan mentality of like

2071
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:03,520
fucking google it like look it up yourself like you can find out the answer quicker if you just

2072
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,840
looked it up then if you wait for me to respond people just don't kind of think that way because

2073
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:11,600
they're stupid they have to be educated yeah I mean you know they're ignorant people have to

2074
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:15,680
try learning how to program before they realize that everything's on google and you shouldn't ask

2075
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:21,120
anybody unless you can't find it on google yeah yeah dude and by the way I while I was saying that

2076
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:26,880
before I remembered a couple other personal influences um let me see it was Gary Ridgway

2077
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:32,960
Jeffrey Dahmer uh John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy and then recently I've really been getting into

2078
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:37,600
Dennis Reynolds from always sunny in Philadelphia those guys are kind of the the pentagram

2079
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:44,160
I like how he's listed among serial killers yeah what no I'm a big I'm a big admirer of the

2080
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:50,160
I really admire the work of John Holt his masterpiece made a big splash you know you know this is

2081
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:56,080
this is underground guy you might not have heard of Vlad the impaler he's really great stuff you

2082
02:22:56,080 --> 02:23:02,320
know I support him on you know Adolf Adolf Hitler his paintings are kind of bad but some of the

2083
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:07,680
stuff that he wrote man he did a lot of like uh uh you know people should have listened later on

2084
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:13,680
his career it was no that he was a true bohemian if there's one person I should have mentioned

2085
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:18,960
that I didn't more than anything it would be Yahtzee I think oh yeah I kind of glossed over

2086
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:23,600
zero punctuation too yeah well like like I have you know I have a lot of comedic influences some

2087
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:28,480
of them are the same as hippos like uh like old sketch comedy like I've always been huge into

2088
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:32,960
like watching sketch comedy shows and stuff like that but I think in terms of what I do

2089
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:38,720
in my main videos like the way Yahtzee just kind of flippantly throws jokes in the middle of ranting

2090
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:44,160
is the way I do my humor where it's like I never take a break from the point it's always just like

2091
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:49,760
and then he fucking threw a piece of shit into her face like you know like what I'm saying is

2092
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:53,360
still what's happening but I'm just saying it in a funnier way by the way I'm the only one of us

2093
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:59,360
who's actually met Ben Yahtzee Korshaw yeah you are I'm jealous yep met him one on one I had a

2094
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:04,640
convention I shook his hand got a signature it's hanging in my room yeah that's right I met Linkara

2095
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:14,240
so damn I I met Spoonie so actually I met I met here in Obusaka Gucci oh yeah Ben met Roosh

2096
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:20,240
Ben met Roosh I met Roosh V if anyone knows that actually reminds me uh this isn't really a big

2097
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:25,440
thing much these days but I was big into the pickup community you know oh yeah several years ago

2098
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:29,920
in college so I'm just it doesn't really apply to my life much I'll even say change my perspective

2099
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:34,800
on things what I'll even say that like even though I don't write fiction anymore the last time I tried

2100
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:39,360
was a story called Cyrno and purple Steve that's still online and it was like literally I read

2101
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:45,200
Mogworld by Yahtzee and I was like I want to write a funny thing yeah that's cool yeah so yeah that's

2102
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:51,440
that's cool I've never followed anyone more than I follow Yahtzee like I will watch or read

2103
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:56,400
everything he does just like out of habit and uh yeah that's so I'd say he's like the biggest

2104
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:00,720
person I follow that's how I feel about his literally he's literally the biggest person you

2105
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:09,120
follow other than Jeff now yeah yeah like six foot five six foot five yeah so how tall is

2106
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:16,960
movie Bob on a completely unrelated six foot two really no he's six foot too wide he's a tall

2107
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:23,040
dude yeah I I you cannot tell though because of how wide he is do you think do you think he would

2108
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:29,600
be taller if you tipped him on his side do you think he's perfectly spherical do you think like

2109
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:36,800
all angles are the same I so I I did omit something and I touched on it briefly but I feel like I have

2110
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:42,880
to uh might be the only one who got all my work done on my one try yeah no that's you are off of

2111
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:50,320
your chart didn't yeah I made another list with the ad I I had a list but I I missed one in compiling

2112
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:57,120
it which is uh I like I mentioned him briefly but I can't overstate really how much Tim Schaefer

2113
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:02,560
influenced me and I know people yeah okay yeah I said him but like I know people don't like Tim

2114
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:08,400
Schaefer very much anymore he's a sellout he's he's all these things that people say about him but

2115
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:16,240
like playing Psychonauts and Grim Fandango back to back as a kid like Psychonauts came out for the

2116
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:21,040
PS2 and I played that game and it was the funniest thing that I've I'd ever experienced in my life

2117
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:26,960
up to that point because it blew me away with how funny it was yeah it was a good point because

2118
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:32,560
everybody hates Tim Schaefer now for these kind of meme-y reasons yeah but he was I hate that he was

2119
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:37,360
a he was a great creator yeah and he's like yeah like the same thing you can say for like

2120
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:42,160
Joss Whedon everybody hates Joss Whedon now because always he's a cock and he's fucking feminist

2121
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:47,840
they did he did really fumble that whole Kickstarter oh absolutely he's fumbled a lot of things PR wise

2122
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:52,800
although what I respect him for is he went on Reddit and he actually like answered questions

2123
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:57,840
where they were like how did you fuck up this thing and he's like well we yeah what a hero

2124
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:04,080
face the music on Reddit over his internet connection in an AMA most most people like most

2125
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:10,560
people yeah like I respect that I respect his sense of humor a lot and like the biggest thing for me

2126
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:15,760
is playing Grim Fandango and Psychonauts back to back because I played Psychonauts and I was like

2127
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:20,640
I have to consume everything that this man has ever made so I downloaded scum vm

2128
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:25,360
download a day of the tentacle played that played Grim Fandango which was really fucking hard to get

2129
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:31,440
running on my computer by the way that game oh man the grime engine does not play nice with

2130
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:38,800
anything um but playing all of those things and like starting to understand who Tim Schaefer was

2131
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:45,600
as a kid that was the first moment in my life that I was like holy shit art is something that like

2132
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:51,360
I could do as a person and that was like the moment when I was like I want to make video games

2133
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:57,040
which eventually transitioned into I want to make YouTube videos so oh what a low yeah yeah

2134
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:02,720
just you know look no no it's not just keep lowering that bar it was an accepting of like I

2135
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:08,400
want to make art and I started out wanting to make video games more than anything but then I was like

2136
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:14,000
you know what what I do best is acting editing and writing and YouTube is the place for me

2137
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:19,840
before on the show but the number one advice to all creatives is you have to like doing it

2138
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:25,600
not like the idea of having done it so if you like I think most people who try to get into

2139
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:30,480
making video games that is like what you realize is that making video games is one of the hardest

2140
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:36,000
kinds of art to make because programming is so much not art process of like coding which is

2141
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:43,200
fucking boring you know so uh and I think that's why like I have I have like four different full

2142
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:49,040
fleshed out games that I want to make but fuck man programming right not happening all right we

2143
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:55,520
gotta wrap this up because I have to pee really bad okay let me are we are we finishing follow up

2144
02:28:55,520 --> 02:29:03,920

2182
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:38,720
because I did exactly what you didn't wait for two hours to take a piss taking a piss I assumed

2183
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:40,000
you were taking a crepe

2184
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:48,160
back to crepes go um oh yeah I was in the crepe store with my friends and I didn't have any money

2185
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:56,960
so I was like why am I standing in line mm-hmm so I saw my two friends um they were my two friends

2186
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:02,000
who are women's that's important to the story they were like out of the corner of my eye I saw them

2187
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,600
go and sit down with their crepes so I figured I don't have any money why am I in line I just

2188
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:11,760
can't hear that word without just hearing craps now yeah some craps shut up guys shut the fuck up

2189
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:16,320
so I so I saw my friend sitting down I thought okay I shouldn't be in line I don't have any money

2190
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:21,200
so I went to go sit down with them I sat down next to them and I just like I sat down and I

2191
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:30,160
immediately said hey that's a nice crepe like commenting on her crepe and so they both looked at

2192
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:34,800
me they looked up at me and they had this look on their face and I looked at them and I realized

2193
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:42,560
these are not my friends I don't I don't I don't know these women

2194
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:47,680
so wait you sat down next to them right that's what's happening yeah I saw them out of the

2195
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:52,640
corner right I thought they were my friends I sat down and said nice crepe and they looked at me

2196
02:33:52,640 --> 02:34:00,560
like who is this fucking crepe trying to fucking hit on us via crepe and I just like it was like

2197
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:04,400
this like moment of silence when I looked at them and I realized what was happening and I just got

2198
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:14,640
up and I was like wait how was that a normie because yeah I was I don't know because they were

2199
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:22,720
normies oh they were normies I don't know it was like an rk9 kind of like a green text I'm a frog

2200
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:29,440
man pepe moment I guess yeah yeah where where were your friends though were they just at a

2201
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:33,840
they were still alive they were still buying their crepes and then you like walked back and

2202
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:40,560
hoped none of them noticed no I told them because it was hilarious okay good but it was also like

2203
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:45,040
like the the entire rest of the time we were in the restaurant I was like spacing out like I was

2204
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:49,200
just I was like thinking about what just happened I couldn't like join in the conversation I wasn't

2205
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:53,840
even they were like having fun talking and I was just like waiting for these two women to leave

2206
02:34:53,920 --> 02:35:00,720
so that I could feel safe again who I fucking accidentally sexually harassed and like I started

2207
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:07,760
like I started like really like going into like the what just happened and like sort of like concocting

2208
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:12,160
scenarios like oh god what if it gets even worse because then they had a guy with them and I'm like

2209
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:16,320
oh god what if the guy comes over and says like why are you hitting on my girls via crepe and so

2210
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:20,480
then I was thinking like oh my god I'm gonna have to fight this guy and then I was like and then I

2211
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:28,480
was thinking of like how I would take this guy down like how I would use this mental

2212
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:33,440
battle against this man okay you're just like figuring out we're not even there movie with

2213
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:37,920
jet lee hero where you know he they vision the two warriors visualize a fight between the two

2214
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:42,240
and it's all a battle inside the mind only this in this case it's all in jesse's mind yeah so it's

2215
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:46,400
just like it's just like imagine like all my friends eating crepes and talking amongst themselves

2216
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:57,920
and then like me just spaced out like all around me and then and then suddenly it's just someday we'll

2217
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,440
find it

2218
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:15,920
I never leave the house so that'd be difficult I have experiences like jesse's all the time we're

2219
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:21,280
like anytime if something awkward happens to me in public I imagine like this incredibly elaborate

2220
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:25,360
scenario of where I think it's gonna go but I have a safety mechanism for that which is that

2221
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:30,080
there's always one moment where I imagine something so ridiculous that I then become

2222
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:36,000
convinced like it hits me I'm like wait the fact that I've thought about this means it's too stupid

2223
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,480
to happen and that's always how I get through those because I start to get paranoid and I'm like oh god

2224
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:45,120
what if it always ends with the police with me it's always like I'm gonna get arrested and then

2225
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:49,840
like dude once it hits dude I'm like wait the fact that I've imagined all this means it's so

2226
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:55,360
unlikely that this will now happen that I could have predicted all this is is that like a common

2227
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:59,520
thing because I do the exact same thing I tell myself because I've imagined like things never

2228
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,360
happened the way I picture them happening so because I pictured it that's why I'll never be

2229
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:09,120
successful but whatever all right folks that's enough for that is time to wrap this bad boy up

2230
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:14,080
and ship it thank god or two and a half hours deep

2231
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:27,600
this will be the podcast we just throw in the trash
