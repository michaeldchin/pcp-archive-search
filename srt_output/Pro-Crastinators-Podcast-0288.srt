1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I want to bless that guy. That's son of all things.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Son of all things. Son of all things.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Son of all things.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Aw, welcome to the Pro Crastinators podcast. Where are the reason people are dying?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, I'm the Pro Crastinators. That's true.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's the phrase we use every time.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Every single time we say that. And every single time it gets funny.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,160
It gets truer I'm opening up my speak pipe so that when we get to that part of the show we will have

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,400
Which is now let's go straight to voicemail honestly, we probably should

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,840
Know I have you I do I do have a few things to talk about this time. I have I was I was unprepared

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,200
I didn't think to like write down notes this time. I did at least one

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,660
I have I have three notes today. I I have three notes

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Usually these stretch out for a long time

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Well, we want to lead off

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,480
with something yeah, okay, so I

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,080
Have been playing and only a little bit because it's very new and I haven't really had a chance to use it yet

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
And have you heard of Pikmin bloom?

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,320
Is that the new Pikmin it is a Pikmin Pokemon go clone

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,160
Made by the made by Niantic and it is I saw it involves

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,800
Walking around Google's street map view, but with Pikmin involved instead of Pokemon and it's it's really cool

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,300
Actually, because it's it's not about

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,640
Going and finding rare Pokemon although there are Pikmin that are rare and all that they got a cell

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,520
bullshit like

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
things that they have they're all like coin store and all that but

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,000
The draw is not about like going and exploring and spinning Pokestops and gyms and stuff. It's just walking because it counts your steps

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,400
It's a step counting game

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,720
so it just encourages you to go on walks to make flowers bloom and

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,960
Pikmin and you just have a bunch of Pikmin following you around on the map. I did see some people talking about it on Twitter I

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Mean I have not played Pokemon go in a long time because of my shitty phone

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,120
Which I definitely should have switched to the new phone that crack gave me by now. I just haven't done it

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,320
Phone yeah crackers gave me if he had a bunch of phones

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,200
He said that and he just was like here. This one's this one will work better than yours. He's gave me one

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Why I have not switched yet

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,160
So I don't know if it's true, but it probably is

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,520
Yes, it's it's cool because it's like

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
You don't have to actively actively play it. It's basically

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,400
The egg hatching, you know bunch of steps in a Pokemon go you hatch eggs by walking large amounts of distance

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,880
You don't have to have your phone open and an active so you can it uses like the Google fit like step counter

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,840
So you have to download Google fit it'll count your steps when the phone is just you know on standby and

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,560
Then you open it up after you've had like a walk in the park or you're just going around to a place

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,120
You know what just going anywhere and then you say oh look at all the new like nectar

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,440
I got and then your Pikmin you can feed them near the flowers bloom

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,840
And you just have a bunch of Pikmin and you they use like the Nintendo me

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,360
You know avatar this link to your Nintendo account or you don't have to link it, but I did

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,160
And it's your it's your me. It's your me. So it's much more customizable than Pokemon go, which sucks

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,840
To be to be frank does suck the customization sucks

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,920
You can have one haircut hair style. That's it stupid, but the me's are looks like me

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,560
It's it's really me for real and

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
and on the cutest thing is

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,720
You can use these petals that you get from your Pikmin and

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:24,000
You like activate them and then flowers start blooming where you walk and the point of that is to

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Lay flowers so that you can look at where you've been but also everybody in the game sees the same flowers

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,200
so if

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,000
You've left a trail of flowers people can see that trail

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
If they're in the same area, it's just sort of like slowly the world is being

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,800
covered in flowers and nice things and you do that to like make larger

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Like flowers bloom in place of like poker stops

58
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,040
There's like these big buds and the more flowers that are grown around it the more they grow and then like items can fall off of them

59
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,800
And your Pikmin can just pick them up and bring them to you and it's really like casual you just sort of

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,640
You see cute things happen every so often and you just need to go for a walk

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,960
It's not not an intensive annoying min maxi game like Pokemon is sometimes

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,040
And I like it. I like just you don't really need to do anything and it's cute

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,680
I love a game where I don't have to do anything all you need to do is go outside and that's a good thing

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Even though it is a good thing. That is a good. It's it's getting old. It's getting a little bit cold for going outside

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Gonna take my I can take my air conditioner out of my window. I keep telling myself. It's fine

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,120
And I don't have to move it. No, I'm sure it's not leaking cold air or anything, but it's it's it is it is

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I have a

68
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,480
I still don't go I'll go out a little bit more often these days

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,320
I still don't go out enough. I don't go on like walks anymore. I guess I probably should I should I need to as well

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, it's just one of those like oh, but I like being fat and lazy. That's way funner. That's true. That's true

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Speaking of being fat and lazy

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,440
My lifts are come my lifts are coming along. I'm strong now

73
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm my lower back is sore. I my dead my last deadlift

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
I think I pushed it a little far my my form was bad and I was like no

75
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,960
So I went I went down five pounds and I deadlifted again the other day and my form was good

76
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,240
I was like yes success, but my lower back is really sore. I think it's sore in the good way

77
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,200
I think it's sore like it was a good workout and not like my bones have incurred some damage my my

78
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
connective tissues

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,160
Don't worry about that the more you break the bones the stronger they become they grow back stronger. They grow back stronger

80
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Yes, that's right. That's right

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Thankfully, thankfully, yes

82
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,300
Just hit your head against a fucking brick wall and then you'll be you'll have like a shield your brain

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Brain damage and your brain will grow back stronger the second time

84
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Not smarter just stronger

85
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
Mass not definitely not smarter. Yes, it will be tougher

86
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,880
It will be scar tissue to resist a second attack. It won't be able to think though

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,520
Man, I saw a I saw like a gif or I saw a video of

88
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,320
neurons on like a Petri dish

89
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,240
It was like a microscope

90
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
footage of

91
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Neuron, I mean the caption said it was neurons attempting to make connections and the neurons were like

92
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,280
They were literally like like swirling around like moving around and like extending their little cell

93
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Arms and like reaching out like trying to grab each other

94
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
And I was like rose but cool

95
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,080
It felt and I mean it it felt like the way it feels when you're trying to think of

96
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,480
Something that you forgot and you're like trying to reach like oh, what was it? What was it?

97
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Uh, it's and it's like it's little cell arms like reaching like shooting out like trying to

98
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,440
Grab each other and make connections between each other. I was like they stretched before I was like I was like yep

99
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,240
That's what it's like. That's how it is in there

100
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,080
It was pretty it's kind of gross a little horrifying like most things are

101
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,760
Hmm, I don't like to imagine my brain filled with tiny little squirming arms. No

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,960
I like to imagine my brain as a corridor with doors in it and you go in the door and it's like hey, I remember that

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,080
No false I

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,400
Shit shit. Oh fuck that was gonna make me

105
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,080
Say something, but what was it? Oh, no help and neurons you saw

106
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Brains fired when you saw something

107
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,840
Memories. Oh, no, I can't remember

108
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I literally have to squeeze out my nasty little cell arms and grab more of them

109
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,400
Come on neurons a glomerate

110
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Think think

111
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,700
Think think about what you're trying to do to me

112
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,560
That's the if you watched a Sonichu lecture, too

113
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
You know that that is the official theme

114
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Anthem of quickville is think by Aretha Franklin. Oh

115
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,280
She she wrote that song after looking after looking in a microscope and seeing some neurons squirming around and thinking yeah

116
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
That is what it's like. I want to write a song about it

117
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,560
Uh

118
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,320
Think think about how you're just a collection of neurons. I

119
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,240
Was watching I thought love was real but actually oh, it's just a chemical reaction bitch

120
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
rick and mortade

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
speaking of

122
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,640
There was a I was I was catching up on the anamorphic time podcast. I'm a few episodes behind

123
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
but I watched one and

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,880
Think it was Tyler of Nate and Tyler. I think it was Tyler that said something about like

125
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,160
The human the human body is like it's like so much of it is actually just bacteria

126
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,400
Like we're basically just a scaffolding for bacteria to live in

127
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I know that's true in the in the intestines kind of yeah, probably not in the whole body

128
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,640
Equally, I don't think that's true in the brain

129
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
fortunately

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, and the gut probably

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There oh, um

132
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
This is interesting

133
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,920
Viewer a viewer of the show a watcher of the show named Bob Disgaea was on a

134
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Was on an episode of anamorphic time and I think is going I think it's the next episode that's coming out soon

135
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
I think

136
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,440
and

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
apparently he

138
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,360
He he he messaged me on discord and he told me about it

139
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,120
And he said that he peppered in a bunch of like PCP memes and references or something and I just thought that was pretty funny

140
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,840
It's um, it's a weird epic. It is epic. I can't wait for that episode is not out yet

141
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,520
But I think it's coming. I got a catch-up on the show so I can be

142
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,840
Contemporary when it what even is a PCP meme. I'm trying like well, I know I know he drops at least one

143
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
patreon.com slash

144
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
It's a great PCP me I

145
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,040
He didn't specify. He's just kind of a vaguely alluded to that he made a bunch of like

146
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,800
He he made some references and I don't know what they were but I'm curious. Um, I

147
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
I um

148
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,320
The the wait shit. Oh god, I'm reaching again my neurons

149
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
What what's happening to me today

150
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,920
Um

151
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,520
He it was again, it was about mine is a petri dish

152
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,920
Wait, it was it was about

153
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,960
It's it was literally on this subject. It was about bob disgaea

154
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
It was about anamorphon time

155
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,680
Oh, um, I don't know if this is a coincidence or not, but

156
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,640
The anamorphon time guys have a guy

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,840
They have a guy who I think hooks them up with like interesting animal facts. I think that's what this guy's job is

158
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,920
He sends them like the the most interesting like weird animal trivia for them to discuss and

159
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,000
That guy's name that guy is a guy who I knew he used to be

160
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,240
In my old discord not on the current iteration of my discord

161
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,040
But in the previous iteration from a few years ago

162
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
That guy's name is divine soup can

163
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,840
And like I was listening to anamorphon time and they're like, yeah our gay our guy divine soup can and I'm just like

164
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
I think I was like what?

165
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I think I recognize that name. Yeah

166
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Wacky what I guess I guess it's a coincidence that it's just a guy who

167
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Used to be around

168
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:21,320
And now he's over there people on the internet. Yeah exist after I stopped looking at them. I wish they would not

169
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Actually

170
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
As a matter of fact

171
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:35,240
Speaking of well, I was gonna say speaking of whatever you were speaking about but it's got nothing to do with that

172
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,840
um

173
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Picross right?

174
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,360
I love Picross. It is my my go-to

175
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,760
brain game

176
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
time waster

177
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,720
And I've been playing the steam game of Picross

178
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,840
And I've been slowly completing every single

179
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Puzzle that they have and I'm now up to like the very last one which is 40 by 40

180
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Which is a very big grid

181
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,560
And there's they're like the the method of like figuring it out works every time

182
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,520
So I don't really need to think that much. I just need to count

183
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
From left to right up to down

184
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,440
Filling in the squares and it's taking over my life

185
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,960
I feel like after I completed this entire steam game of Picross

186
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Pages and pages and pages of puzzles

187
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll be like well now what do I have to buy another steam game?

188
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Do I have to buy more do I have to

189
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,440
There can never be a pick. You must you must complete you must consume

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:41,640
You must consume more content is what you must do at that point. Oh, I don't uh, it's it's too much

191
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
It's it's like yesterday

192
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,520
I I was I had red letter media huff in the bag in in the background and you know

193
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,160
At the point where you're like rewatching half in the bag because you've already rewatched all of the best of the worst

194
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
That you've been doing too much youtube

195
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah, and I'm like real listening to that. I'm just doing Picross all day and I was like, oh wait

196
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,520
There was a day here and I it's gone

197
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,960
I've been I should stop but it's just so

198
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,560
Like you click on the boxes and you make a picture

199
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,160
My most my most recent iteration of that youtube phenomenon is that I've been

200
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,680
You know, I I like a bunch of to sneakers videos

201
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,640
But I haven't played most of the games. He's talking about well

202
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,640
I've I'm I'm down bad for youtube content to the extent that I've I've was listening to his uh

203
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,240
Yakuza videos even though I don't play yakuza and I don't know what he's talking about

204
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
But I got to listen to something

205
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,480
uh

206
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,440
It sucks. I can't help I can't help

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,040
feeling

208
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Like I've got to do something about this

209
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,360
But when I get when I sit down, I'm like, uh, you know what?

210
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,400
I feel like just having some random crap in the background

211
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Yeah and doing Picross again, you know

212
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,240
You know what I actually rediscovered something that I this is not the first time I figured this out

213
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,760
But I remembered that actually I kind of work better

214
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
with music on um

215
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
It okay, it has to be like

216
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,880
It has to be the right kind of music. It has to be like energetic music

217
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,120
I have to it has to I have to be vibing with it

218
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
and then I can really like

219
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,480
Help me stay focused on the task at hand and I I've been putting on some some

220
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,080
Some tunes uh this week while I was working while I was cranking out uh phantoms revenge assets

221
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,200
And I think it probably helped me focus better on that

222
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,680
Um, but the thing about that is that there's very little music that like I like and that like I

223
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm excited to listen to and that I

224
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Vibe with in that way

225
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Um, and I so I'm like

226
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
I'll like pick a song and I'm like, yeah, this song's good

227
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,520
And I'll listen to it on loop for a while and then I'll get bored of it and I'll be like well

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Fuck now what there's

229
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
There's nothing else

230
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,320
Um

231
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,680
Yeah, there's a fine line for me with with music

232
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,760
Between being hype and being like, yeah, I love this and being too hype that I

233
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,560
I take my hands of my keyboard and mouse and I start like miming the drums

234
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,760
And just really my head around I kind of help. I love miming drums. That's funny. That never that never happens to me

235
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I get too into it. I it's

236
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Just musician things, you know

237
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I guess so I guess so

238
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,040
Um, interesting to like vulfpeck is like it's so fucking good, but I can't

239
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,520
Work to it. No, that happens to me if if I'm if a if a video essay or some video youtube video is on

240
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,360
And I get too interested in it. I'll like start looking at it instead of my work

241
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,160
With music. I'm never like, oh, I gotta like

242
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,680
I gotta like pay attention to this. I gotta drop what I'm doing and pay attention. Yeah, I mean, that's why

243
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,680
Half in the bag and and best of the worst is good because it's just sort of like

244
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,320
Some noise. I've seen these videos before and occasionally rich heavens laugh is so loud and I'm like, oh, yeah

245
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm no

246
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,080
There they are

247
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,600
But I should be doing work to that and I'm not I'm just playing pick-russ again like a fucking rube

248
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
Although at the moment

249
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,840
like

250
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,720
Well, I said last week I'm working on secret project stuff

251
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
and I

252
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm still sort of doing that, but I'm sort of like

253
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,000
Going back to my computer at the end of working on that

254
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,960
secret project

255
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,720
And doing the the red letter media. I mean, you can't I mean, you can't work on it like 24 hours a day

256
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,920
No, no, yeah

257
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,440
So while I'm working on it, it's not really the sort of thing I could do with uh sound

258
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
Yeah, like in distractions, but whatever

259
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,840
With with that I can I can um, I can draw

260
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I can draw with music

261
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,240
Yeah, I can't like do I can't like

262
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,680
I can't really program with music and I definitely can't program with like

263
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
a like talky youtube video

264
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,040
um

265
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,480
Drawing I can do a bit by sort of uh reflex or a bit by sort of like

266
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,440
I don't really have to think about it too. I can just kind of do it by feel. I don't have to concentrate on it that much

267
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,920
um

268
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,480
Um, well, I mean it depends what it is

269
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,640
um

270
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,240
I mean sketching out like a blocking out a page of a comic

271
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,640
Is more intensive than line art. Yes

272
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,240
You're just filling in the things and making each line look good with other lines. You don't really need to think about

273
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,480
the entire

274
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Feeling of the page because you figured that out already with the sketch. I was oh, man

275
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,120
it felt

276
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
amazing I had a

277
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I had a euphoric moment

278
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,400
A few euphoric moments this week actually is when I was working. I was working on

279
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I was working on actually shit. It might have been last week. It's sort of blending together

280
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,080
Um, but I was I was working on fans of revenge. I was drawing some assets and I I don't want to say

281
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,080
It's be too specific for spoiler reasons, but I had to

282
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,160
draw spray because the butler did I had to draw a

283
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
face I had to draw a face

284
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,480
that was

285
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,600
screaming screaming with rage and I

286
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
was so I like

287
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,480
I I sketched it and then I like moved it to the my little like

288
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,400
Sprite template and then I like sprighted over it and I like I added the details and the whole time I'm drawing this face

289
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000
I had music on

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was vibing with it and I'm drawing this this this rage face and I'm

291
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,160
And I was making the face. I'm like, I'm twisting up my own face and rage is going like

292
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,920
Like making the sound did I talk about this last week?

293
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,560
I think you did talk about because I remember I remember screaming into the microphone last week

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
I just it felt so good

295
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
It felt so fucking good

296
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Being enraged

297
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,920
Uh, okay. Sorry. Sorry to bring that up again. Uh, listen, we've done

298
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
3000 episodes of the pcp

299
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,880
Uh, it's I guess it's it's okay to recycle material, but it's not okay to recycle material from last from last week

300
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,760
So I have to I have to be careful about that sort of thing

301
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,240
um, yeah, I mean

302
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,360
For me, it's a little difficult because like the secret project

303
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Secret I don't want to reveal it yet, but I'm thinking in the back of my head

304
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,240
Well, if it has been revealed I could there's so much I could talk about so much content

305
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,720
I can make and put in this podcast we're doing

306
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,560
Yeah, it's like hard because like aside from that and playing video games and learning about pikmin

307
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
There's not really much I've been doing

308
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,640
How do I fill a podcast with oh, I've been working

309
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,000
I've been working on something working. You'll know beats beats working

310
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,320
Yeah, yeah, I mean I I have to wonder at some point like does anyone care what the secret is

311
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Would I already know what it is?

312
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,360
You do but like like the people like would it is the is the hype building or is there no point to me keeping a secret about it?

313
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm not sure. I think

314
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I think that um

315
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:29,960
Probably some people listening are curious what the secret is probably most people will only be the most hype when it's

316
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,200
Revealed all of a sudden, right?

317
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,560
I feel like I feel like the real the real win of being secret to a certain extent it might build hype

318
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,600
Well, okay, it would build hype if you were like it's a secret

319
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,440
It's a secret but but I'll release it like at a specific date

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,040
And then you would hype up like this is the date that I'm going to drop the secret and maybe you

321
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Drop a few like very tiny breadcrumbs

322
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,160
If you do that would maybe build hype in the moment

323
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
It's probably only building a bit of interest

324
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
But it will be the moment when you release

325
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,960
And all of a sudden you're like here's this fully finished thing that I never even talked about before

326
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
That will be everyone will be like what?

327
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
It is one of those like

328
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,720
Because I imagine like

329
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I'll put it out on the pcp

330
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,240
Not everybody listens to the pcp that's in the like pcp fan circle

331
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,160
So I have to go to discourse and tell people individually. Hey. Hey, look at this. Look at this

332
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,280
And even then there'll be people who slip through the cracks and be like months and months later be like, oh my god

333
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,760
Give I had no idea you were doing this. I was like, yeah, well

334
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Follow me on twitter. Are you idiot?

335
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,120
I'll you don't talk about it. Oh, well, well once you put it out. Yeah once I'm not gonna not tweet on twitter

336
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,160
It's gonna be gonna say it in every possible way I can

337
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,720
I wonder what my reach is if you could if you could quantify that

338
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
Yeah

339
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,360
How many people could I notify about a thing I'm doing?

340
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I believe yeah your your reach

341
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,400
I believe the term for that would be your reach. Yes

342
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,280
My neurons how far can my neurons reach other neurons from other people?

343
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
um

344
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,800
So, yeah, I get phantoms revenge is like no longer a secret project. It was for a while. Um

345
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Oh my god, I'm just I'm thinking

346
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,920
Man, I started working on it in December

347
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,400
And then I I released the demo in april

348
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
And now it's november

349
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
God I'm like

350
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,080
God

351
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,800
I that that feels terrible. What even happened this year? I don't know

352
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,680
Oh my god, I don't think anything happened. I think I was sick most of this year. That feels terrible and I

353
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,560
I I hope I I feel like okay. My gut says the answer is no

354
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,440
But I don't know if I can trust my gut on this one. I hope that it's wrong

355
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,360
My gut feeling is no and the question is like was it worth the time?

356
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Does did the time justify itself?

357
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,520
Uh in in working on it. I hope so

358
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Uh, I guess we'll see

359
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Oh wait, I know what happened

360
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,880
I made the lord of good for yeah, well for me the lord of ghost kickstarter

361
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,040
Clarissa gunsmoke and then from january the secret project was started

362
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,040
You did do Clarissa gunsmoke this that was this year, right earlier?

363
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Yeah, there was a few there was a few weeks months ago. It was fully released and I you know august

364
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,480
How long ago was august what the fuck well, it's november

365
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,600
That would have been three and a half months ago. No, it was longer ago than that, right?

366
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,360
There's no way the no Clarissa gunsmoke initially with the streams was last year, but I released it recently. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. That's

367
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah, yeah

368
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,480
Um, but I

369
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,680
Okay, the thing about secret projects though that I want to say is phantom's revenge is no longer a secret project

370
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,560
But I have recently started another secret project, but it's not no. No, it's not what you think

371
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,440
I'm not going to say what it is. It's not a thing that I have revenge dlc

372
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,320
It's not something

373
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,480
It's not something like phantom's revenge where i'm going to be working on it for a long time. It's just a little

374
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
It's just a little uh thing

375
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,280
I can't even I can't even starting a band. I can't even hint at what it is without giving it away

376
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,800
I hope this will not be too long before I can announce it. Um, it is just a little thing

377
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,080
Like I cook in under the hood in the background. It will hopefully be ready

378
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,840
It probably it will hopefully be ready in not too long and I will not actually have to do a lot of like work on it myself

379
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
I won't

380
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,000
Give any more details than that what it is. But when it's ready, I'll let people know and I think everyone will

381
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,720
Have a good chuckle about it. I think it will be very amusing

382
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,840
Uh for everyone and that's all I'm gonna say about it

383
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,320
I see I have an idea what it might be, but I won't say anything. Okay. Yes, please. Please. Please don't please don't say anything

384
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,720
If you have an idea. Yeah, um, but it's

385
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,200
It's a little

386
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
It's gonna be funny. It's gonna be really funny

387
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Okay, that's all I gotta say about that

388
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
Um

389
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,320
All right, uh, let me complain for a second. You already know this kid, but I just got a complaint about my headphones. Um

390
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,960
Yes, so for a long time. I've had this my headphones have been shit

391
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,400
And uh, they just sometimes like the the battery they're wireless the battery dies on them all the time

392
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,200
The signal sometimes just fails recently on the last like five or six episodes of the pcp

393
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I've had a thing where my

394
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,560
Signal will get choppy and I'll have like difficulty

395
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
It'll be a little choppy

396
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,760
and

397
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,800
The only way I can fix it is by turning my head a little bit to the left

398
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,400
Just sitting where I am and just turn my head a little bit left

399
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,520
And then it it it works better for some reason

400
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,120
um

401
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,080
the

402
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,040
Today I plug in my I had unplugged my headphones because I had been using my usb ports for other things

403
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,440
So I plug the dongle back in and I sit down to record and

404
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,920
There's almost no signal. I can just it's so choppy that it's just a little occasional

405
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,480
And um the I'm like okay

406
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,800
And I try turning my head and it again I can turn my head and when I turn my head to this one particular angle

407
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Oh, I can kind of hear

408
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,960
But I'm like I can't just sit with my head at a single angle

409
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,800
It's so bad that I'm not just going to sit here frozen in place with my head at this one angle

410
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,320
Like a radio aerial just like oh, oh, I gotta tilt my head or I can't hear

411
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
So I had to get my these other headphones out

412
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,720
My dad gave me a pair of headphones a while ago

413
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,640
And I busted them out today and I've plugged them in and they're working pretty well

414
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,280
I don't they're not as comfy. I don't know. They're they're the kind that like go over your ears, which I sort of don't like as much

415
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Um, but whatever they're fine

416
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,840
They're fine except that the cord these are not wireless. I think they have a bluetooth connection, but I have not enabled it

417
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,440
but um

418
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,440
The the the headphone jack cord that they came with is so short. It's like two feet long. I can't move my head

419
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,920
Oh god. Oh, I know. Oh god. I unplugged it. I unplugged it

420
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,000
Wait, I'm plugging it back. I moved I jerked my head to make a point

421
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,000
Um, can you hear hello? Are you there? Okay? I can hear you. Okay. Wait

422
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Say say something

423
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,880
Okay, no, all right. I thought maybe I was hearing it through bluetooth, but um

424
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,360
Okay, say something again something few. All right, uh, cool. So anyway, that's my

425
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,280
I was gonna say gotta get a longer cord, but actually I should probably just try and enable bluetooth

426
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,840
I guess that would probably be good. I never liked wireless headphones

427
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,720
I mean, I know the appeal the the utility of such a thing

428
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,960
Very obviously great. You can move your head around, but I've got these um

429
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,440
I've had these I think I have to take them off to see the logo hang on

430
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah, Sennheiser

431
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,920
Sennheiser headphones that are like used

432
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,760
They were recommended by my university as like good for doing audio work

433
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,360
So I got those and they've got a really long cable

434
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,720
I can walk all the way around the room wearing them and they're comfortable

435
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
And I've had them forever

436
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
And it's just a wired connection. It's just so much more reliable

437
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,520
When I even even with my wireless headphones, I would often

438
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Use them with a wire because they would need to have them plugged into a wall socket

439
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,960
You know because they'd be out of battery anyway. So like half the time it it didn't even matter that they were wireless

440
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,360
Yeah, it doesn't yeah, it doesn't matter to me that much

441
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Whether they're wireless or not

442
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,640
Um, just this short wire is very annoying. I can't

443
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,640
I mean at least I can change the angle of my head. I just can't move my head more than like two feet away from my

444
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
computer tower, uh lull

445
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Um

446
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,280
Hey, you know what I was you know what I was uh doing I did a little bit the last like day or two

447
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,480
Just because you mentioned it on the last episode that I went and I I watched some

448
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,440
I watched some some british, uh, uh

449
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,280
Some british financial youtubers talk about credit cards

450
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,360
Uh, oh

451
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,880
Yes, I learned a little bit. I sort of I was a bit disappointed to learn

452
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,800
What I had already felt might be the case

453
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Which is that um the rewards you can get from british credit cards are just not very good

454
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,000
No, they never looked very interesting. There's one there's one guy I watched called sasha yansen

455
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,200
And his basically he said that like

456
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,240
Yeah, like like cashback rewards cards in the uk

457
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,080
Almost don't exist like they used to kind of exist

458
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,280
But now they they've been like just in the last like a year or two. They've been like drastically reduced

459
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I think because due to covet he said it's that seemed to have something to do with it

460
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,720
But he recommended he recommended there's like one left that kind of is good

461
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,160
That he recommended and they were um the amex the amex platinum cashback

462
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,480
And the amex platinum cashback every day are two like similar

463
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:28,600
Cards that do give a a note a substantial reward. They have a certain like they have a sign-up bonus and they have a percentage cashback

464
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,280
uh bonus so if you were still

465
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,600
interested that was

466
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,000
Uh what he recommended amex platinum cashback cashback cashback every day the difference is like the every day one is no fee

467
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,680
But it like has like a slightly lower reward basically, so it's like if you're gonna spend over like 10 000

468
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,040
Over like 5 000 pounds in a certain period

469
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,440
The the regular one is better, but if you're gonna spend less than that the every day is better

470
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
Something like that

471
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,480
um

472
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,680
That was that that was the what I learned that was basically the gist of what I learned

473
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:10,600
Uh from do you have a link to that video so I can listen to him say it. I um, yeah, I think there were

474
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,920
Sasha Jansen baron cohen

475
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Wait Sasha Jansen

476
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah, there were there were two there was one where he just kind of

477
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,840
Okay, I think I think this was the video. There's one where he goes over like

478
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,960
Okay, I I think he probably mentions the the amex platinum

479
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,960
Every day cashback in this one right here. Uh, I'll put it in the

480
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,200
Sorry, I'm taken forever to do this. I'll put it in general here

481
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Does he does he mention amazon classic tesco foundation zopa aqua advanced capital one classic

482
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,320
Oh, no, these are um

483
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,640
These are no these are like beginner ones

484
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,040
There's a different video where he recommends the the amex platinum one

485
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,960
shit

486
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
No, I gotta find it

487
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,640
I have to find elias are cut out the awkward silences

488
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,680
Uh, okay. He definitely does mention the amex platinum cashback in this one

489
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I think this is it

490
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
There might have been one or two other ones, but uh, yeah, anyway

491
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,880
Okay, that thumbnail is funny. Even though I use that as the currency denominator

492
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,160
Symbol it's funny seeing it being like oh make pound pound pound. Oh, yeah

493
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,000
Instead of dollar dollar dollar. Yeah, I'm so used to seeing dollars used. Yeah, just as like, you know, you're right. I noticed that too

494
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,160
Those crazy Brits in there crazy crazy gbps

495
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,200
I love I've always loved writing the little pound sign not like that. I do like a squiggly one

496
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah, with like it's the loop at the bottom. Yeah, the loop way loop at the top and the bottom

497
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Yeah, I like it too. Um

498
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,880
I like I like I like treble clefs and I like ampersands

499
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
And I like um the pound sign

500
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,240
The the gbp pound sign not the hashtag. Yeah, is there a name for that or is it just the pound sign?

501
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Yeah, it can't well if it's called the pound sign then it shares its name

502
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,560
Hold on

503
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Sim, okay symbol

504
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,320
This is fun fact challenge. Oh, we're looking up first symbol for gbp

505
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Uh

506
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,440
Okay, well, it's well, it's called the pound sterling

507
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
No, it is it's just called the pound sign

508
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,800
pound sign the pound sign is the symbol for the pound sterling

509
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,440
Okay origin symbol derived from the uppercase latin letter l

510
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Representing Libra pondo

511
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Also pondo pound, okay

512
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,080
same

513
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,680
Basic unit of weight so it was always a unit of weight same same origin as the lb for like pounds as in the weight measurement

514
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Wait, no

515
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,960
Is is that that's lb not lp

516
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Oh interesting lb toss

517
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:25,640
That the pound it was always a weight became an english unit of weight and in england became defined as the tower pound

518
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,800
Equivalent to 350 grams of sterling silver

519
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,680
So it's based on silver the literal weight of silver is why it's called the pound

520
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,440
Interesting. I I feel like I knew that I feel like

521
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,760
I'd never looked at this before I kind of just assumed that like it had to be a pound of something right

522
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,880
And I mean it's called a pound sterling so like of course it's silver

523
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
What else

524
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,040
I was

525
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
I was

526
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,400
Wait, you there?

527
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,120
Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Um, you miss me

528
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, um

529
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,680
Big big Joel made a thread on twitter the other day where he talked he mentioned he talked about inflation

530
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,960
And how like inflation is kind of good actually

531
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,320
Because like if if a currency inflates

532
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I don't care about his fetishes

533
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Ah

534
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,280
It devalued it devalues it literally like helps the bottom

535
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,200
Like percentage because it devalues the assets of the people that have a lot of money

536
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,720
And it devalues the debt of people that owe money

537
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,320
Like it's like in when inflation it's literally like good for poor people when inflation happens as long as it doesn't like go out of control

538
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Hyperinflation the economy's broken

539
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,840
um

540
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,920
And he mentioned he mentioned the gold

541
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,360
I forget that he mentioned this and I had heard of it before but it wasn't something I knew a lot about he mentioned that like

542
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
the switch like from the

543
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,680
From the I think from like the the gold standard to the silver standard or something was like a big

544
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,040
Like proletarian movement. It was like a working class movement to switch from the gold standard and like

545
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Doing that like somehow

546
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Caused like a mass wealth transfer

547
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
basically

548
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
It was it was the idea was like

549
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,800
That also was sort of like devaluing currency

550
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,840
But it was like there was a big like there was like a labor push

551
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,440
For like the the adoption of like the silver standard

552
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,560
And it was and like the goal there was like yeah devalue the currency

553
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,520
because it represents in effect a

554
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,640
mass wealth transfer from the top to the bottom

555
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,880
Uh and inflation kind of does that which is sort of interesting

556
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,080
I guess that makes sense if you've got like a large amount of money and it goes down by a percent

557
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
The richest people will lose more

558
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,720
It's it's it's true person. It's it. Yeah, it does make sense and it's and it's just true people get

559
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,840
People get hung up on like oh inflation. Oh my my money is worthless and like

560
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,600
Yeah

561
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
true

562
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Your your money is worth less

563
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,200
sort of but like

564
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,960
If every if yeah, if everybody's money is collectively worth less

565
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Then the cost of goods

566
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
must

567
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
increase across the board

568
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,600
Right well like like it your money is is worthless, but people who have more money

569
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,480
It's worth even less and so it's sort of normalizing

570
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,920
Yes

571
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,280
So in in terms of like where you stand on like the hierarchy you have actually moved up because the people above you have been hurt worse than you

572
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,120
Uh based a little bit based a little bit base

573
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,280
um

574
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,040
Yeah

575
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Economy am I right?

576
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,040
um

577
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,720
No, you're wrong. Oh, oh the the reason why okay, um

578
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,000
Long long time viewer someone who I someone whose name I remembered but I had not heard from or seen post in a long long time

579
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
on twitter reverse spectrum

580
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,920
Uh, he added me with a video that he thought I would be interested in and he was absolutely right. This was amazing

581
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,160
um, this was a video

582
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,720
about the infinite money machine is what it was called wait the the um

583
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
What was the channel called infinite?

584
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,520
money

585
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,120
machine

586
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,080
This was okay. The the channel was called patrick boil

587
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
Uh

588
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,680
This video is very funny. He delivers it in like a very dry sort of sarcastic way and it's it's really funny

589
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,160
It's a good video here. I'll link the video. Um

590
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,640
The the point of the video is a story about a guy who

591
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Basically he basically scammed his credit card company, but it's like legal

592
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
He just exploited a loophole were in

593
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,000
He had a card that gave him 5 cash back on at grocery stores. So he would go to grocery stores

594
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Buy visa gift cards

595
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,560
Use the visa gift cards to buy money orders

596
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,520
Transfer the money orders into as deposits into his bank account

597
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,440
And then use the balance in his bank account to pay the

598
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,840
The the credit card that he had used to buy the visa gift cards

599
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,520
And you know all the the fees in that transaction

600
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,800
Were less than the 5 cash back that he was getting from doing it

601
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,480
And so he was just getting free money every single time he did it and he just did it for a year

602
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
And he made like 300 thousand dollars

603
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,600
and

604
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,520
Yeah, and the funny and the funny part is they couldn't even tax him

605
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,880
They couldn't even tax him on the income because it's not income. It's discounts

606
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,920
He he generated 300 thousand dollars in free money and it wasn't even income

607
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,400
It was 300 thousand dollars in discounts of money that he never had in the first place

608
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,440
um

609
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:06,040
Just just awesome just awesome and um, I guess that doesn't work anymore. It's um, okay

610
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:14,040
It might work in some cases. It's basically just a question of like how soon will the bank catch you doing it

611
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,440
If the bank, I mean the bank can terminate your account for any reason if they catch you generating hundreds of thousands of dollars

612
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,400
They can just terminate your account if they want to so it's basically just like how

613
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,040
How can you fly under also?

614
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,680
Yeah, it's how long can you fly under the radar doing it?

615
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,520
And also I think that kind of across the board like rewards and cash back have just kind of gone down

616
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,800
Uh in term because of like the economic, you know recession and stuff

617
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,760
Um, so that's a bit so it's a bit harder to do. It's definitely harder for a multitude of reasons

618
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,360
But I think I don't know I was considering how I could maybe pull off a limited version of it

619
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,520
um

620
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
like, uh, I don't know I have um

621
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,760
I could buy like instacart gift instacart gift cards

622
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
I can buy them online. I don't even have to go to a store

623
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,120
If I could flip them

624
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,640
For even a small even a for like a relatively small

625
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,840
A fee I could do that with the I have I don't have unlimited

626
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:24,120
5% like this guy had but I have I have like 5 cash back on groceries up to like an annual limit of like

627
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
You know $10,000 or whatever

628
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,640
So if I could like do that much I could be generating, you know

629
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
A few hundred maybe a thousand dollars

630
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,200
I mean optimally if I if I could do it with no loss, which I probably can't

631
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Um, but it really makes you think

632
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Gets your noggin joggin

633
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Uh, there's something

634
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,400
So appealing to me there's something so appealing to me about like

635
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
About cheating the system

636
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
About like just living on like not

637
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,920
What's really appealing to me about stuff like this is that it's like if this is how you make your money

638
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,360
You're not working for anyone. You don't have an employer

639
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,880
Nobody is extracting your your surplus value

640
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,080
You're just taking it from people with more than you

641
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,840
And I just think that's so cool. It's noble. It's noble in my in my opinion. I would call myself a hero actually

642
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Oh

643
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah

644
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,400
Um, so anyway good good good video that one. Oh, he has another one about like the beanie baby

645
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,560
He had one about it was it's sort of about crypto, but it's more just generally about like

646
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Bubbles and like, you know in like

647
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,560
Investing frenzies collecting frenzies in general. He talks about like

648
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,680
Just collectible assets or so-called treasure assets in general and how

649
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,320
Like yeah, sometimes they increase in value, but they're usually like they're lossier than like traditional assets

650
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,720
They're more subject to risk

651
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,520
They're more subject to like market whims. They don't generally outperform

652
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,640
Uh, sometimes they do but they in general they don't outperform the market

653
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Uh, so they're just kind of stupid

654
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Uh

655
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
God, I don't know crypto is bad

656
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,760
Uh, he compared he compared the nfts to like the beanie baby

657
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,200
craze, which I think is probably definitely true

658
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,200
God

659
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,880
Yeah, if if only they the nfts were as cute as beanie babies

660
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,480
I know right they could they could at least they could at least be cute if they do nothing else

661
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,160
Um, it ironically would make it like harder to hate if they were like cute

662
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,960
I don't know animal animal crossing-esque like little things. It's like oh look at others the fact that they're ugly. It's just like

663
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,200
Honestly, it's it makes it so easy

664
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,680
Honestly, I'm glad

665
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,960
Honestly, yeah, I'm glad that they're ugly like I'm glad that they look like shit

666
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,360
If they looked good, I feel like fewer people would hate them, which would be bad

667
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,160
So like I'm glad that they look bad. I'm thankful

668
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,240
I would hate to live in a world where like they're good and people like them

669
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,160
I

670
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,160
I guess the only other thing I have on my list of things to mention is that I've been reading a book

671
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Could you believe it?

672
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,760
No

673
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,840
It's called uh, it's called the general by c.s. Forester

674
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,960
Oh, that's a good song. Do you know that song?

675
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:44,040
I I don't I have seen the others and I have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting

676
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
I like that song. Anyway continue

677
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,080
Yeah, the general first published in 1936 is kind of about uh, a general in

678
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
his his life and times

679
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,200
During before and then during the world war one

680
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,720
Where he's like doing stuff. It's just really nicely written

681
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
And it's good and it's a little tiny little

682
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,840
ancient little

683
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,520
book

684
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
But the best thing about it

685
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,960
The best thing about it that I found is that I have this leather bookmark

686
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,520
And I love having a leather bookmark in my hands

687
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,640
Well, my other hands I'm reading the book because something about I've had this for like

688
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,400
More than a decade. I've used it for various books

689
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,560
It's a bookmark that doesn't degrade easily. I think about other leather bookmarks from like, I don't know

690
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,360
Like uh, you go to a fucking place or zoo and they have like the generic station area a zoo

691
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,040
Yeah, when you when you try to think of a gen a generic place the first thing that comes to mind, you know

692
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:56,520
Like a zoo places that are like locations that are cool for kids and they have places that give like

693
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,360
Yeah, yeah gift shops and memorabilia and stuff. Sure. Yeah

694
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,560
They they they have their their things relating to the place they and then they have the generic stationery

695
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,880
Oh, it's a pencil with the name of the place you're at

696
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,120
pencil sharpener

697
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,320
Whatever

698
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,960
There's like a lot of these leather bookmarks. It's hard to say bookmark

699
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,960
um

700
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,040
And they're so fun to have because you hold them and there's they they give a little bit

701
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,880
They're kind of tough, but over time you sort of wear it in

702
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,400
Mmm, and it's it's a really good. It's a really good

703
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,120
fidgety thing that doesn't break easily

704
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,920
And it's you know, it's just

705
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
It's a tactile

706
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:45,560
That's why I like reading real books is only because of the bookmark is so fucking fun to hold in my hand while I'm reading

707
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,520
Yeah, I can't get into kindle because it's like, uh, I'm looking at a screen

708
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,840
I I've heard that screens are bad

709
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
Even though it's not really powerful screens are bad

710
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,560
But like, um, and if it's on my computer or an audiobook, I'm like, ah, but I if I'm listening to a podcast

711
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,760
Audiobook, I got to be doing something else and I I can't pay attention to it

712
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,720
But reading a physical book works because of the bookmark

713
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,520
Everybody should have a leather bookmark and they will read like a hundred thousand times more

714
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
That is my and it's my pitch for bookmarks

715
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
leather

716
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's a hard sell

717
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,840
The general itself is is a very nicely written book

718
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,680
But it is very old and there are a few times where the hard rn word is used. I've seen

719
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,080
What is it about?

720
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,880
Well, it's about a general in his exploits to like

721
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,720
Go through the ranks and it's like it's a character book. It's not really like so it's a war. It's about this one guy

722
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,240
There's a novel. Yes. Okay. Okay. I think there are some

723
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Characters that are real generals or real like army officials that were integral to the war and he interacts with them

724
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,400
and

725
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
and it's like, uh, he's kind of

726
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:06,200
Autistic this guy. He's all very prim and proper, but he hates social interactions and he just talks in very normal

727
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Not normal, but like very direct

728
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,480
emotionless ways

729
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,720
and he gets he has like he

730
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,320
he meets a

731
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
the the daughter of a

732
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,080
duchess

733
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,760
and she is like described to be sort of horse-faced and ugly

734
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
and like not not particularly

735
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,800
you know

736
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,600
Fancy and stuff for her station. She you know, she knows how to dress and all that but it's like

737
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:40,360
She is unremarkable and he's kind of socially awkward and they really loved each other and they got on so well

738
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,160
and it's like

739
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,480
You know, she she as a as a daughter of a duke and duchess

740
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,440
Doesn't really she's quite sheltered. She doesn't know what a real man is like

741
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,920
Um, she doesn't know what it's like to have like sex that's like good and he's kind of bad at it

742
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,400
But because she doesn't have a frame of reference

743
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,880
She's okay with all that and it's it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny how

744
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
this guy

745
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,840
I don't know it's it's hard to explain the the appeal of this character in this book

746
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,000
um

747
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,320
The general go read it. Just it's it's my book report. Who who's it by?

748
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,600
A c.s. Forrester as I said, oh, sorry. I'm stupid lull

749
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,160
He's a he's a guy who who wrote something or other. What did he write?

750
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:37,000
He wrote something or other. I don't I don't know. I don't know books. I I just like sphabas or something

751
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,720
Something something hornblower

752
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,880
Observer, I don't know if I can know I'm reading the back like I have it right in front of me, but yeah

753
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,800
The general it's it's like

754
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,720
I think the thing I like it's Herbert Curzon is the name of the guy character

755
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,760
Yeah, the thing I like about him is that he's kind of autistic

756
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,680
and

757
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,520
Very relatable to me in a funny way in funny ways like he's so old fashioned

758
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,040
But like his his his thought process is like described in such a way that I'm like, yeah, you know what?

759
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,560
Parties do suck. I do like not want to go to them

760
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,520
True and he's and he's all like he's really into

761
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,360
making his army his his battalion is his

762
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,920
Squad I'm not sure what you call it that he's in charge of

763
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,760
um

764
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,400
By the time the first world war is going and he's in the trenches

765
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,880
and he's like um

766
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,880
he's really into

767
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,960
like be he's he's got a

768
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,560
A way with like making sure everything runs well for the purposes of being better than other people

769
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,040
And people respect his like strictness and is no nonsense stuff

770
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,920
And he's not like he doesn't have a good personality which makes him perfect for like running a tight ship

771
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,400
and it's just sort of

772
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,320
I don't know it's it's weirdly cute. I find him weirdly cute as an old-fashioned timey general

773
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Hmm

774
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,400
I'm reading the I'm trying not to I'm reading a bit of the

775
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,680
story framework on on wikipedia

776
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,960
That seems I've never read I've never read anything by c.s. Forrester

777
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,080
I just had it on my shelf and it's like, oh, this is old. Maybe it's good, you know old good

778
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,160
new bat so

779
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:41,800
True and it turns out to be true. That's what I did with um when I lived with those guys in um california for a while

780
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,680
I just like one of the girls had a bunch of old books on her shelf and I just grabbed old books and read them

781
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,240
That's when I read um the plague by camu

782
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
and I read uh

783
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,480
The stranger also by camu just read a lot of camu. Wait is stranger by camu?

784
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:06,120
I don't yes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Um, she must have been a camu fan

785
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
um

786
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Neat, um

787
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Oh god, there's a there's a loud

788
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,840
The helicopter outside my window, but the way there were there were people talking

789
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,320
There were people talking like right outside my window when I first uh logged on but they they quickly

790
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,400
Stopped so good good for them. I appreciate that a lot

791
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,280
Good for them. I have only one more note about things I did this week

792
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:43,400
And it was something that I got really excited about almost as excited as I got about drawing that angry face

793
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,800
last week

794
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,200
Um, it was about it was about water

795
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,480
It was about I was really hyped for different kinds of waters that I could acquire

796
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,640
I was um

797
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,160
I went on

798
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,160
I went on

799
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,080
I went on instacart and I'm like I'm almost out of sparkling water

800
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,160
It's time for me to shop around for more and I went on

801
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,880
I went to uh, hana fords. I looked I looked up the menu at hana fords

802
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,840
I looked what they have what what they have on offer in terms of sparkling water versus seltzer water

803
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,280
I looked at uh, aldi. I found I found new offerings at aldi that I had not seen before

804
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,360
um

805
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
I have I have learned

806
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,880
I have I now have a big shelf full of all different kinds of

807
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,320
sparkling waters sparkling water beverages and seltzer waters

808
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,120
Uh, as well as just water beverages neither sparkling nor seltzers. Um

809
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,440
God, I'm I'm truly rich in spirit

810
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,080
um the the

811
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,120
I have learned that many places sell things that are called sparkling waters

812
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,520
But they have artificial sweeteners and like flavorings in them

813
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
Making them basically just soda

814
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,600
But with like a sort of health conscious branding

815
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:10,440
To them, but I like them a lot. I love them. They're my favorite. I think I think there was like a tom scott video

816
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,120
explaining why disani isn't sold in the uk

817
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Hmm because like uh coca-cola

818
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:26,040
Owns disani and disani is like an amer- it's it's seen as an american thing to have mineral water where the minerals are added

819
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,960
um

820
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
like artificially

821
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,800
And so like this kind of like uh, it was a huge backlash

822
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,520
against disani once that was found out and

823
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,000
because of a

824
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,680
TV show only fools and horses an episode where there was a scam

825
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,040
It was a comedy skit show and what's oh, okay, okay

826
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,640
and uh, there was an episode where there was like a scam with like

827
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:56,120
Sewage water being sold as special something or other and that was like in the public consciousness when that scandal happened

828
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,320
Or it became a scandal because of that and then they couldn't sell that water because nobody trusted it

829
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,880
So and and so mineral water is like you can't put the things in afterwards

830
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,320
You can't add things to water has to be just water. What the fuck?

831
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,880
Wait, okay. So the problem with disani is that they add minerals to it

832
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,360
Yeah, they they they have a treatment plant where and that's and that's bad

833
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,000
I I think chemically there's no difference at all. It should be fine

834
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,840
In fact, it is as far as I understand disani any water where you just

835
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,640
Mineral water like from the scottish highlands or whatever I guess bottled and then sold and it's like

836
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,080
Oh, it's actually from there or it's actually it's like got rid of like

837
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,720
Crud and soil and you know bad things they filter things out

838
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,200
But they don't add like chemicals in

839
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,680
Because of the public perception of that being a bad thing even though it's probably fine

840
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,920
So that's just how water is in the uk. That's why I have never seen or like rather

841
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:02,600
Um, but we have different brands for water bottles in the uk that I've never seen in america or like the other way around

842
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:10,440
And I didn't never have seen disani before I went to america. It was always avian or volvo or like stuff like that

843
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,240
Highland spring

844
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,240
I think

845
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,640
I think that's the difference between

846
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,280
sparkling water

847
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,920
And seltzer. Uh, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Uh

848
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,000
Okay

849
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,960
I think that like if if they artificially

850
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,800
carbonate it

851
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Then it is seltzer

852
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,120
If it's like naturally carbonated

853
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,760
Uh, then it's naturally carbonated. Yeah. Yeah, like certain. Okay

854
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,760
It seems

855
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,880
Silly and I kind of feel like there's no way they actually do this

856
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,800
Like they actually go to like a naturally occurring like carbonated water spring and like obtain

857
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,680
Natural sparkling water from the spring like there's no way that they do that

858
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,480
But like supposedly that's the difference between seltzer and sparkling in practice

859
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,000
I have I am finding that the difference is that sometimes they will they will just add a bunch of shit

860
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,120
Add a bunch of like flavorings and sweeteners and shit to spark to sparkling water

861
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
And make it basically soda

862
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,680
Uh, but not always and then they don't do that

863
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,000
Then it's just

864
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,680
I think the difference is that the carbonation is artificial and versus natural

865
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,520
um

866
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,880
and

867
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,200
Minerals man. Minerals are just a whole other whole other ballgame

868
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,200
uh

869
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,200
That's that's

870
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Really so like

871
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,080
Is that is that a it's a is it just a weird uk thing that they're like you can't add the minerals

872
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,200
You gotta you gotta find the night the minerals got to come from the earth or I don't want them

873
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,640
Yeah, I essentially I mean, okay

874
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,680
I think it's it was it was more just like

875
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,320
A scandal happened

876
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:03,320
And then from then public perception was like, oh, it has to be like real otherwise. It's it. Yeah, it's being natural from

877
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:11,240
You know a water source or a high up in the mountains or or just wherever but like you can't add chemicals into water

878
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,960
We won't buy it and so that's just sort of continued

879
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,800
I don't know whether it's changed, but from what I remember from this tom scott video, which wasn't that long ago

880
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,600
Uh, it's still like that

881
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
I'm reading some article here

882
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,040
Spring water is according to fda. This is american definition

883
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,440
A spring a spring water is according to fda derived from an underground

884
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:40,680
Formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth at an identified location called a spring

885
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:47,240
It can be a man-made borehole, but there are other regulations associated with that if it's a man-made spring

886
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,320
Uh mineral water also comes from an underground source

887
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,720
But it differs from spring water because mineral water contains a quote

888
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,960
constant level and relative proportions of minerals and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source

889
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
What

890
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,040
What

891
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,800
So mineral water is just spring water, but it's like it has a certain amount. It has like the right amount

892
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,480
of nutrients in it or minerals, I guess

893
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
artesian water refers to

894
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,880
Water that comes from a tapped aquifer artesian actually refers to the natural geological process of pressure that causes water

895
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,800
From an aquifer, which is a layer of permeable rock and soil that can store water to rise to the surface and form a well

896
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,680
Oh, no artesian. Oh, not artisanal. It's not artisanal water

897
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:45,640
It's artesian water, which is not referred to like craftsmanship. Okay. I know what an aquifer is because I play dwarf fortress

898
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,120
So no need to explain that to me

899
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,160
Uh my my recipes dot com

900
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Um fuck

901
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,400
So reading gov dot uk about so much rigmarole. What is what is this considered?

902
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,280
Mineral water and the definitions of stuff. I think it's mostly like a branding thing

903
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,880
Like you can sell water where you add stuff in but you can't call it mineral water or something

904
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,760
Because it would be insane

905
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,200
I guess tap water is technically mineral water. I'm not even sure actually

906
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,600
Okay, this is just a list of all the natural mineral waters recognized in the uk

907
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,560
And how to apply for recognition. Okay. Well, whatever. It's not information

908
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,800
It's just a list

909
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,920
I don't know how to read this that that definition that I just read seemed to specify the to be mineral water

910
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,400
It has to it has to have the minerals

911
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,360
When it leaves the ground

912
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,200
Yes

913
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,200
So I guess us has that as well. I don't know. So disaney

914
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
is um

915
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,160
Okay, dis disaney is not mineral water. It is

916
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
Purified and mineral enhanced water

917
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,400
Yes, that's the distinction. Okay. I see I see it may have been it may I may be reading too much into the video

918
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,320
Because he may have said like it's the reason disaney doesn't get sold

919
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,240
Because there was a an association with treated water being gross

920
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,560
or something

921
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:19,880
This reminds me there was a not illegal. There was a video recently from folding ideas

922
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,680
Where he talks. I think it's a a british like celebrity chef. I forget the chef's name. Oh jamey oliver. Yeah

923
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:32,040
Did you see that the chicken nuggets video? I I yeah, I have seen I never really thought about it before

924
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,840
But it makes a lot of sense that he's probably like a bit of a

925
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,080
upper class

926
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,880
the

927
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,480
Yeah, the

928
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,480
the thing about like oh

929
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,720
The chicken what's wrong. What's wrong with the nuggets is that they are unclean

930
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,280
They are made of the unclean part of the chicken the dirty chicken meat

931
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,400
Not the good not the good clean chicken meat the filthy haram chicken meat

932
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,920
um

933
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,040
Yeah, what do you there's that one line dan says where he's like, you know, if if your criteria

934
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,320
For eating of food is that it has to look nice at every stage of production like that's a you problem

935
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:15,640
That's not really a mark against the food that like at some point in the production like something looked gross about it

936
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,320
Right. Yeah, jamey oliver has been around. I've seen him a lot as like a uk like

937
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,440
guy of of food

938
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,680
relevance note

939
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,240
and and like he's he's definitely been like

940
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,280
prominent in the way he talks about

941
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,160
Uh, I'm just trying to protect the kids because they're eating all this gross

942
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,280
Fatty crap and it's bad

943
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,080
And everyone's like, oh, yes. Yeah, it makes sense

944
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,800
Never really thought about him like that before but it does make sense to think of like he's just

945
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,080
He's health conscious

946
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,640
But like kind of in a stupid way

947
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,200
Yeah

948
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,440
I mean, is it like in the video how he's like

949
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,960
He's sort of trying to contend that the nuggets are unhealthy, but it's not like

950
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,080
It's not really argued

951
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,600
that way

952
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,180
It's argued in a sort of like wishy-washy

953
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,640
aesthetic

954
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,800
Yeah, kind of I mean, I guess this is dirty sort of way dirty for just reasons

955
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,520
Yeah, just for reasons. I

956
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,920
I think it it resonated with a lot of people

957
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,440
For some reason at the time when he was like he was hot shit. He was he was the the the young

958
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,280
crazy new

959
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:37,320
Chef kid on the block and he's coming out with all these recipes and he goes he goes like bing bong bash

960
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,680
Bosh

961
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,280
Pan like that and I was like, wow cool. Yeah. Wow. Look at this guy. Look at this guy go. He's so quick. Sure

962
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,720
I haven't really seen anything that he does though aside from saying that nuggets suck

963
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:55,080
I mean, do you I guess do you watch cooking programs? I I don't really I

964
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:02,520
Well, you know, my parents watch the Great British menu, which is like super high and

965
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,320
Chefs from all corners of the UK

966
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,480
Great Britain Northern Ireland Wales all that Scotland and they have like one from each district

967
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,200
one from each sort of area north of England

968
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Midlands or whatever

969
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,560
And they compete to make a banquet meal

970
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,440
For like a big event somewhere every every year or so

971
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,160
And that's that's a good one

972
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,080
I like because they're like top of the line like Michelin star chefs

973
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,560
From and they're really good at what they do. So it's very interesting seeing them

974
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,600
make like insane

975
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,120
Meals to a brief of like a theme

976
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,280
That's quite fun. And then there's the Great British Bake Off, which is

977
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,520
Well, I've heard of that one baking. Yeah, that that's a big one

978
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,320
Because it's it's you know, that's fun. I don't really watch like much

979
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:02,520
Myself I'm just sort of catch it when it's on it's like. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at that fish

980
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,600
Look and like chop those onions real quick. They know what they're doing

981
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
And I think I have seen a bit of Gordon Ramsay

982
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,760
Yelling at people. Oh, sure

983
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,040
Who who has because that that that's always fun, I guess

984
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,080
Uh

985
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:29,480
What would we how do we get on this topic? Uh, you were talking about sparkling water. Oh, and how the like food

986
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,160
right how

987
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,800
The the the dasani is unclean because it's the minerals do not come from the earth

988
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:42,520
Uh, I just remembered this. Do you want to I mean, have you been following the uh, the the kyle rittenhouse stuff?

989
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,720
I've been seeing a lot of kyle rittenhouse stuff on twitter

990
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,280
I will not have too much to say about it

991
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,440
I didn't follow it when it's when it first came out as a like a big news thing and I still haven't really followed it

992
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,440
like the just I get

993
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
Is that he killed some people

994
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,560
and the court is determining whether

995
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,760
You know how the

996
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,560
What should happen next is he gonna get punished and thrown in jail for murder or is it self-defense?

997
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,040
And that's the big question. I guess he he uh, it seems okay

998
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:19,240
People say he was defending himself and in the moment. Yeah, he definitely was being

999
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,480
aggressed upon

1000
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,560
The the the question in my mind is like

1001
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,440
Was he was he aggressing simply by being there and I really think he was

1002
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,320
I really think that the fact that he went to this place

1003
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,680
Open carrying, you know brandishing his weapon at the protesters was like

1004
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,880
made him a a what's what's the like, you know

1005
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,600
Basically constituted an active threat and I feel like the the protesters were

1006
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,440
Defending themselves by trying to you know disarm him

1007
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,280
um

1008
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,280
and I think you know

1009
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,280
that's my opinion and uh

1010
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,160
I am it's very it's been very sad and disheartening seeing

1011
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,840
Lots of people lots and lots of people

1012
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
Even people who you might have thought would know better

1013
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:12,680
Uh be like watch the try watching the trial and be like oh, yeah, I guess I guess it was self-defense after all

1014
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,920
Oh, yeah, I'm pro. I'm pro written house now

1015
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,880
Uh, it's seem seems like

1016
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
In my I mean in my corner of the internet

1017
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:26,120
Obviously everyone thinks he's you know, he's guilty seems like the broader

1018
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,480
Internet is is turning pro written house, uh, which is is just very sad

1019
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,360
Uh

1020
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,600
I don't

1021
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,840
Maybe it's just doomer talk, but it seems like even the the people that I follow

1022
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,360
I follow a few people who are lawyers who have said like

1023
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,320
He's getting off. He's got he's getting a full acquittal

1024
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,760
Which is very sad, um and makes me upset

1025
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,920
um

1026
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:00,920
But I mean in my head like I just assumptions I make from bits and bobs. I see is that oh well, he's white so

1027
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,480
like uh

1028
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,040
Him brandishing like an automatic weapon

1029
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,080
Uh is like

1030
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,840
It's gonna be looked at less harshly by the general public

1031
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:19,640
Uh, then if it were a black person and for that reason I just assume maybe he you know

1032
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,000
But like I can't really assume that until I've looked more into it

1033
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
So I'm just uh, whatever

1034
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,560
Maybe it sucks. Maybe it sucks. What's happening, but I'm stupid and I haven't been interested enough to look

1035
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,880
I have been

1036
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,240
honestly, I

1037
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,240
You know, I've seen some of the

1038
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,880
Judge being like weird and and bad

1039
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:47,320
And I've seen a lot of the lawyers being like doomer about it being like this is fucked. He's getting a full acquittal and like

1040
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,520
I don't know. Yeah

1041
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,240
I can't I can't affect the outcome

1042
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,120
And like who knows how things will shake out

1043
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,720
Why why I'm

1044
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,760
I feel like I know what's going on. I've kind of just been like I don't sort of don't want to read anything else about it until it's over

1045
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,080
and maybe then I'll

1046
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,240
I'll be curious what the verdict is

1047
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:14,600
Why why worry about it until then? I mean, I guess if I really wanted to

1048
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:21,880
Take that logic all the way like why worry about it even afterwards like it doesn't directly affect me. Why worry about anything?

1049
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,200
Um

1050
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,480
Why even care at all? Why not simply touch grass?

1051
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,840
Uh, which I mean, I guess I guess that's true

1052
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,000
I don't know. I don't know. I have no conclusion

1053
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,000
The thing the thing is that I've heard is well, it's like

1054
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,680
The the details are iffy

1055
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,240
Like it's not like there's like it's not like a police shooting

1056
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,840
Where they had a body cam and it's so obvious that the policeman has done wrong or like it was filmed

1057
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,160
But yet and yet still

1058
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,720
The police are getting off

1059
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
You know with a tap on the wrist

1060
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,000
Um

1061
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,320
So like from what like the information involved in what happened is is confusing

1062
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,520
And so it could go either way like it could actually be

1063
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,160
Like I don't know it really I think I think bringing a bringing a gun to a protest

1064
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,480
Really betrays like what you intend to do at the protest. Yeah, why bring a such a large gun?

1065
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,640
Yeah

1066
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,200
He was he was he was he was there to he was there with a gun to protect

1067
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,560
Property other other people's property

1068
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,040
with deadly force

1069
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:43,320
And some and some people online think like that's okay and that's good and people should be allowed to do that and should do it more

1070
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360
Which is pretty fucked up

1071
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
He

1072
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,720
I don't know I don't know what else to say about it. Uh, he it's from a moral perspective like

1073
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,160
Stopping a window getting smashed by killing someone

1074
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:05,720
Is not equivalent in any way. There's there's no in mind. There's no question that that's that's what he was that that's what it was about for him

1075
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:14,360
Um, he maybe is an intimidation thing. They're like, I don't know sure you have live ammunition. You uh, yeah, whatever

1076
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Yeah, um, he

1077
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,400
The I've seen the have you seen this judge

1078
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,440
The the judge really seems

1079
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:28,920
The judge really seems like a piece of shit. The judge really seems he really seems biased in favor of the defense

1080
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:34,120
And he really seems like he doesn't know what he's talking about and like there was a part where

1081
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,480
He just seems weird and like he just rambles about shit for at times

1082
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,000
And there were there's a part where like I didn't see this part

1083
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I just heard about it, but I guess the prosecution

1084
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,440
Was like trying to show him something on a screen

1085
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,160
And it was a digital, you know photograph

1086
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:58,600
Or or video screenshot or whatever and they they're they're zooming in right they're just zooming into the image

1087
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:06,440
And the judge doesn't understand what zooming in is and he thinks that they're like digitally altering the image by zooming in on it

1088
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,920
And they had to like I guess he asked like extremely old

1089
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,640
He's he's not like he's he looks like he's maybe like late sixties

1090
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,400
So he's pretty he's pretty old. He's not like ancient

1091
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,040
He's quite old

1092
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,840
Yeah, but like he

1093
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,760
I guess they had to like consult an expert witness about like weather

1094
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,360
Zooming in on a photograph counts as like altering

1095
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,080
The data but like it doesn't he just seems like he doesn't like

1096
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,400
Want to hear

1097
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,920
He seems biased is what I'm saying and also incompetent. So

1098
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,080
You know

1099
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
Who knows who knows?

1100
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,440
um

1101
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,440
It's a lot of like it's a lot of like I can imagine, you know, I can imagine

1102
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,160
that there'd be some

1103
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,040
larger

1104
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,760
Like um attempt to get kyle out of

1105
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,160
easy

1106
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:11,160
By like, you know, like familial connections or stuff like that. Um, I could you could imagine a lot. I just

1107
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:18,040
Personally don't know too much about what's going on. So it's hard to say. Oh, yeah, it's all a big bunch of bullshit

1108
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
I'm not in yeah, so whatever

1109
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,360
I'll just say that I think it's dumb to bring a gun

1110
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,240
to a place like that

1111
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:33,880
And then not expect anything bad to happen if he gets if he gets an unequittle

1112
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
the messages

1113
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,760
White people

1114
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,760
Go out to protest with a gun

1115
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,320
shoot protesters

1116
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,880
The system supports you

1117
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
Um

1118
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,720
Yeah, I don't know it's bad. Um

1119
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,800
I have no more notes. I'm out of notes. I'm out of topics of discussion

1120
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,360
Uh, do you got anything else or should you want to go on to voicemails?

1121
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Uh

1122
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,840
No, I don't think so

1123
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:13,080
Uh, let's go. Let's go. Do you have um

1124
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,240
Oh, yeah, I'll get whatever whatever whatever it's called open

1125
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,000
Speak pipe speak pipe comm slash pcb voicemails

1126
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,880
If you want to send us a voicemail, baby

01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,840
Um, all right, let me just get these downloaded here

1128
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh, yeah

So, yeah, this was um because later that that day last sunday when we recorded last episode I did go on the drawcast

01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,120
It was sitel teleperte

1142
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,160
Was it oblivion oblivion fall? I think yeah, it was like a regular is a host

1143
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:31,720
Yeah, I think it was I think was it just the four of I think it was the four of us. Yeah, we did a um, we did a comics jam

1144
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,960
which you know

1145
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,960
I you know the pcp

1146
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:45,000
Invented the drawcast and I introduced the pcp two comics jams. So it's basically I basically own this property

1147
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,720
It all came from me

1148
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,880
We did a did you mention that on the show? Yes, I did a little bit

1149
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,800
Um, uh, yeah how I introduced I think it was at

1150
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,600
Brony con. I think at one of the brony cons. I got everyone to draw a comics jam

1151
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,280
Sitting around in the hallway. Well, hang on. I remember munchy talking about someone

1152
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,000
Telling him about it and him telling you about it or was it the other way? No

1153
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,000
No, it had to be the other way around because I learned about it from one of my fellow

1154
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,960
Camp counselors at astro camp

1155
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,680
I definitely did not learn about it from munchy

1156
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,760
Okay, so you probably told munchy. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I must have

1157
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,600
um

1158
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:32,440
That was funny. We did a yeah, those were we did some pretty funny comics in that one. Uh, there was a

1159
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:39,240
There's a there's a keg standard in phantom horn comic in there, too, which is very good and I like it a lot

1160
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,880
Uh, so I got I got teleparted to draw keg in phantom

1161
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
Uh

1162
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,360
Uh, yeah, that was that will be out in a few weeks. I think over on the drawcast

1163
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,800
Channel, so go to the drawcast channel

1164
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,840
There's a bunch of the content on there and eventually do you know when the the telephone?

1165
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,760
One is coming out or people still working on their drawings for that one

1166
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:11,960
Doing the drawings and then they're gonna come back around and ask us to like have like a bit where we

1167
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,880
um

1168
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:19,240
Like commentate with them over our section of the drawing like sped up. Yeah

1169
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,280
um, yeah

1170
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:27,080
So it'll be still a while before that's finished. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just uh

1171
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,480
Wait for that then

1172
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,760
That's delicious. Mmm. Lemon seltzer water

1173
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:40,920
Not not sparkling water not flavored not sweet and just regular just a touch a hint

1174
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,320
A hint of lemon flavor

1175
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,760
God, I love I love deals

1176
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,920
I love

1177
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,680
I love the taste of a deal. I do this is this is the taste of a deal

1178
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,920
I'm looking at I'm looking at the the instacartman and I'm going through and they've got you know

1179
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,360
They got cans they got lacroix that that's costs like

1180
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:07,640
Fucking $18 a can boo. Then they got like off-brand lacroix. That's can it's also cans in a box

1181
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,680
You know, that's less not good enough lacroix

1182
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
Then they have

1183
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,920
They have what's they have like the uh, the leader the leader bottles

1184
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:23,640
The leader bottles of the various different flavored sparkling waters or like the uh, the six-pack cases of like the smaller bottles

1185
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,960
You want to get it bottled you want to get off-brand?

1186
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,160
And then it's it's like pay it's like sense

1187
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:34,280
It's like it's like pennies literal pennies for me to drink drink like a king all the flavors

1188
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,040
All the flavors of the of the world of of of deepest darkest Peru

1189
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:46,600
deepest africa and the the the the mango the tangy mangoes of the of the of the

1190
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,000
Of the the amazon rainforest uh all brought to the

1191
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:58,040
To my palette um from places unknown all for all for pennies on the dollar

1192
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,440
anyway

1193
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,160
I'm just thinking of like a like a blue steel

1194
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,720
keg of lacroix

1195
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,320
Blue steel

1196
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,480
Why would it be blue like like I don't know just sort of like painted blue like a steel keg

1197
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,360
Like a wooden casket of lacroix

1198
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,920
um

1199
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,400
Lacroix is fine and all it's just that it's name brand so it it costs more and who

1200
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,920
It's the same it's the same fucking product

1201
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,800
um

1202
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:33,080
Next voicemail is red five rainbow three two one go

1203
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,320
Hey, wait, do you think trixie can like copyright strike you?

1204
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,280
For selling the road to radcon books

1205
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,280
I'm no wait. No, that's a real life one is dm dmca

1206
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,400
No, because she abandoned it because I mean she she did write them

1207
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,320
You're making a profit off of it. She wrote it for and she like

1208
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,480
It was it was it was it was specifically a kickstarter

1209
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,040
It was specifically a kickstarter

1210
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,560
Uh reward that we promised she promised to deliver it for

1211
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:13,080
Radcon and then didn't so like I I mean, yeah, no, absolutely not

1212
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,960
She didn't finish it ben wrote the final chapter

1213
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,600
So it's not entirely

1214
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,600
but I don't know

1215
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,520
I feel like

1216
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,920
Imagine imagine if she tried imagine how

1217
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,880
Imagine how fucking imagine how fucking stupid she would look. No, nothing would happen

1218
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,160
No, it's it would be impossible

1219
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,640
um lamal

1220
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,240
um

1221
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:43,720
Next voicemail good good question good good question fair fair fair question

1222
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
But the answer is no

1223
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:53,000
Next voicemail is called your first voicemail recording always sucks three two one go

1224
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:00,440
Ben look we love you, but your defense of investing in bitcoin without mining bitcoin

1225
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:04,040
The other episode was off-based and someone needs to fucking tell you that

1226
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,200
Just because you don't actually mind the cryptocurrency itself

1227
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Doesn't mean that you're you're not doing harm because you still do harm by giving it legitimacy by giving them money

1228
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:20,200
If nobody invested in bitcoin, it's value. That's a terrible argument and it would just be that's really stupid

1229
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,120
tossing the same

1230
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,600
million couple million dollars back and forth with each other

1231
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,280
Just because we exist in

1232
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,600
Society doesn't mean that we need to participate in the worst aspects of it

1233
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:37,000
Just because I exist in society doesn't mean I must go on to become a police officer

1234
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:41,080
Just because I exist in society doesn't mean that I must go on to become a landlord

1235
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,200
You like listen just because we exist inside doesn't mean that we have to do yeah, I got it all the bad things that society

1236
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,000
Listen you also work to make society better. I

1237
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,560
You know it's true. If that's what i'm criticizing about you right now

1238
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:04,280
If only if only nobody just had invested in bitcoin then cryptocurrency wouldn't be a thing if only people didn't buy

1239
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,880
NFTs then NFTs wouldn't be a thing like yeah

1240
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,120
Obviously I said I said this last week like

1241
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:21,240
Okay, some dag zaggles DM'd me on twitter with what I think was meant to be a technical explanation for why

1242
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:31,400
Crypto transactions are the same as mining and his and he said something about like air dropped coins

1243
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:38,840
And I gotta be honest. I didn't understand what he was telling me dag zaggles if you're listening. I am sorry about that

1244
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,200
I don't get it, but maybe you're right. Maybe maybe on a technical level. It is the same in which case

1245
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,000
It is what it is

1246
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,080
um this argument that like oh you're giving it legitimacy

1247
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,960
Is I just don't care. I'm sorry. I said this last week

1248
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,440
I don't like bitcoin. I don't like cryptocurrency. I don't like I don't like lots of things. I don't like banks

1249
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,160
But I still have my money in a bank

1250
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,760
um

1251
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,960
the

1252
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,960
if if I thought

1253
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:18,200
If I thought if I really thought if I knew for a fact that bitcoin was gonna like double in price tomorrow

1254
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,600
I'm sorry. I would buy bitcoin. I would put all my money into bitcoin

1255
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,000
Would would that be

1256
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,840
Giving it legitimacy. I don't know maybe a little bit. Maybe some insignificant. It's it's too late

1257
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,440
It's too late for me to do anything to like actually stop it

1258
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,920
But like if it was going to explode tomorrow, I'm sorry. Yeah, I would get it because like

1259
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,960
I want my money to double like that that

1260
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,800
I guess it's selfish, but like I don't think me not getting it

1261
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,760
Would have like a significant impact

1262
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:57,480
I just want I want resources. I need to accrue resources

1263
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:03,560
every person needs to accrue resources in order to thrive and uh

1264
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,360
I'm I got I'm sorry. I gotta look out for number one

1265
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:12,840
Yeah, I get the argument, but it's like

1266
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:19,800
It's not that you should strive to engage with things that you don't like but like

1267
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,160
It is a kind of a like at a certain point

1268
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,920
Everything you do is bad because it's all tied up in

1269
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,720
The economy which is tied up in

1270
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,720
other things that like

1271
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:40,120
Disenfranchise people or enslave people in other parts of the world. It's like it's hard to not

1272
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,640
Yeah

1273
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,080
participate

1274
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,680
And when you don't

1275
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,320
Participate in a small section of it as an individual

1276
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,200
Not much changes at all if anything ever

1277
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,960
It is not

1278
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,200
It's not it's not really the the the the the onus doesn't really on the individual

1279
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
to set an example

1280
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,240
That can change

1281
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,840
I don't know the world

1282
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,760
If you have a lot of reach then yeah, you got more onus on you to do that

1283
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,640
I have I guess we have some it's just so small that it's like

1284
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:18,040
It's I don't know I have never I have never claimed that like my

1285
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,920
My own personal not owning bitcoin is like a moral

1286
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,840
stance the the reason that I don't own any

1287
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,800
Actually, I have a little bit that I had to pull out of Kucoin

1288
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,360
But like whatever

1289
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:38,360
The reason that I don't own a significant amount of bitcoin is right now is because

1290
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
I believe that it is

1291
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,880
A bubble that is going to pop at some point and I don't want to be left

1292
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:50,200
Holding the bag if I I'm sorry if I didn't think that

1293
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:55,800
I would buy bitcoin if I thought it was going to go up to a if I was really convinced it was going to 100k

1294
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,800
I'd buy it

1295
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,800
I'm sorry. I'm I'm sorry

1296
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,560
um

1297
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,120
I don't think it's going to or or maybe it might but I also think it's going to crash and I just I'm like

1298
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,280
I'm looking at it and I'm thinking like

1299
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:12,520
At some point. I think it's going to pop. It's going to crash and I just I just don't want

1300
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,640
If if I invest even if it goes even if it goes up a little bit from now

1301
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,480
Maybe I could make some money if I invested right now at some point though

1302
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,400
There's going to be losses and I think it's probably best avoided

1303
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,400
Just so that I don't

1304
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,800
And yeah end up holding the bag. I don't know. I might the issue. I could be right or it could be wrong

1305
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,920
I guess the issue of that argument really is like

1306
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:41,880
It's it's adjacent to like you live in society like you criticize society like you get you live in it in the same way

1307
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,120
He referenced that it could be

1308
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,480
Well, yeah, but like and it's yeah, it's it's it's saying

1309
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,320
um

1310
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,160
you should

1311
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,040
like

1312
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,400
show us

1313
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:58,360
How you would live outside of a society or like how you would live in a better society

1314
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,400
Instead of living in the one you're in now

1315
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,560
right, uh

1316
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,560
No, maybe it's not entirely

1317
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,160
like

1318
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:10,760
The same I'm trying to think of how to put this because like he said

1319
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,760
um

1320
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,800
Just because you live in a society doesn't mean you have to do anything

1321
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,920
He said just because you live in a society doesn't mean you have to participate in the worst parts of it

1322
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,880
Right, I mean true

1323
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,400
I don't have I don't have by doing it. We're not saying we have

1324
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,760
We're not saying anyone should or how to I don't know. I feel like it's just it's

1325
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,080
it's putting the pressure on an individual rather than

1326
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:44,120
Like like like the the point of pointing it out and saying hey, you're doing a bad thing

1327
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,000
is

1328
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,080
It just hurts individuals more than it like changes the world

1329
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,000
If you know what I mean like people just feel bad about what they're doing

1330
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,040
But the system is still structured in a way that it's hard to not do it. Yeah

1331
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,320
And then I don't know

1332
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,640
I guess I don't find too much of an issue with him complaining about you or I doing

1333
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,640
stuff like that

1334
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,640
Yeah, I don't find it helpful either

1335
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,440
um

1336
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,880
I mean, I guess I

1337
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,880
appreciate anyone who is like

1338
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,920
I mean if you're if you're sitting there and you're like

1339
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,440
Hmm bitcoin is definitely going to the moon

1340
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:30,120
But I will abstain from buying it because I think that it would be morally wrong

1341
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:36,200
Like I would I would uh, I would come I would commend you on your on your principled

1342
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:42,440
Actions I would say that's a pretty impressive like moral sacrifice you

1343
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,680
Are making or think you are making

1344
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,080
I wouldn't

1345
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:55,160
If I still like chicken nuggets and even though the meat industry sucks

1346
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:03,000
I I don't know consider there's so many things I could be doing to like to make statements and stands about like how things are bad

1347
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,480
And I will only do the good things

1348
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,280
And it's I don't know it's too hard

1349
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:13,000
Consider that consider this viewer say that if you threw all your money in bitcoin right now

1350
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,560
And then a week like and then it was going to blow up and you were going to make $10,000

1351
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:22,520
You were going to get $10,000 from bitcoin right if you did that

1352
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:30,040
By not by not doing it. You are basically throwing away $10,000. So are you willing to just personally

1353
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,840
throw away

1354
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,960
10,000 of your of your dollar of your potential dollars to you know, not

1355
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,600
inflict whatever

1356
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,720
You know environmental damage would be done

1357
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:49,560
By you know that amount of bitcoin transactions. I don't know exactly how much

1358
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,280
that is

1359
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,720
Unless unless I saw evidence that like it was

1360
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,560
Really like doing like more than $10,000 worth of harm to the world. I probably would still do it

1361
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:09,640
It's hard to quantify. Yeah, and it's it really would only it's like a lot of things if everybody

1362
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:17,080
Had that attitude then there's the solution. I wouldn't sacrifice that would be there unless I knew everybody stopped using

1363
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,120
Cryptocurrency and then everything's great. But of course

1364
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,840
How do you influence everybody?

1365
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
You don't you don't do that

1366
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:30,360
By telling each person individually because you know, a lot of them are not going to

1367
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,320
Agree and then the people who do agree

1368
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
Not all of them are in like a good

1369
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:42,600
Like the the best situation to change up their habits not necessarily just with crypto but with anything that like

1370
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,280
Like like, you know eating meat or or doing this or that

1371
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:53,080
Every it's it's not everybody's in the right position. Some people are and even then they might get lazy

1372
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,800
it's it's

1373
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,400
I feel

1374
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,960
A waste of energy to go after individuals

1375
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,080
To to you know to wipe your finger at them

1376
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,160
and say

1377
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,160
You're doing a bad thing

1378
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,160
by giving legitimacy

1379
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,880
yourself you only

1380
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:18,040
I think there's but at the same time, I don't know what they could do instead that would

1381
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:26,440
Reach more people because that's hard. Anyway, so it is I guess continue to I guess I can't I can't blame I can't blame anymore

1382
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,680
I can't blame them. Yeah, I can't I can't

1383
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,840
um

1384
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,880
Next next voicemail is called caramella boy

1385
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,520
three two one

1386
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,440
Hey, pcp

1387
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,440
I was in for a shitty day at work

1388
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:47,640
But then something magical happened then said check out this stupid caramel dancing video by yannis Ali

1389
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,120
And so I went and did that

1390
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:56,760
And it was just a magical 40 minute trip. I was smiling the whole time. It was like I was in middle school again

1391
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,840
When he said balsamic vinegar, I had like the biggest pog in front of my computer screen because I was like, oh my god

1392
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,240
That's the joke from lucky star. It all makes sense now

1393
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,480
and it was just

1394
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,480
Exactly what I needed to make my day better

1395
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,280
um, thank you so much ben for

1396
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,880
Recommending such an amazing video and even though he's probably not going to hear this. Thank you so so much yannis Ali

1397
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,320
That was an amazing video. You are a true god

1398
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,960
Thank you pcp once again

1399
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,800
caramella

1400
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:33,160
The yannis Ali video is great yannis Ali has made a bunch of good videos. I think that's probably his best

1401
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:38,920
Uh, it was definitely the most I've seen he did ones on like letters

1402
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,080
and they're

1403
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:46,680
Like I think that's the same guy right like like talking about the letter e or something

1404
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:53,400
Maybe his numbers. Oh, yeah, he did he's done a bunch of videos about letters

1405
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:59,560
He did a bunch of videos they seem like intellectual like oh, I guess I need to be a letter nerd

1406
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:06,760
He has really appreciate this a bit, but he has moved more into um, he has moved more into, um,

1407
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:14,120
Like more media stuff and more like youtube friendly stuff recently

1408
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,880
Which is fine. His old his old stuff is pretty interesting, but it's very like

1409
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:25,480
Who are you who are you gonna talk to you about like oh, I learned some interesting facts about the letter c today

1410
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,960
Yeah, um

1411
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:35,080
Yeah, uh next next voicemail is called who?

1412
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,040
three two one go

1413
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,120
Hey, I wanted to ask you guys the who would win where why of radcon

1414
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,840
I'll start with the who on this week

1415
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:51,240
Who do you guys think is going to show up if you do another radcon?

1416
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,480
and also

1417
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,480
Who are you going to name it after?

1418
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:02,920
surely you can't keep it named radcon we could after trixie's dead name especially after trixie is kind of

1419
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:09,480
Not friends with the show or the group. I don't I don't care about any maybe you keep it radcon's a cool name

1420
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,000
Yes, but yeah, who do you think will show up and will you change the name?

1421
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,480
if we did it

1422
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,000
A name change maybe maybe if we wanted to I don't know to

1423
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,440
possibly because like um

1424
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,520
Being obviously I don't think a lot of the people

1425
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,640
Who who used to come would want to come?

1426
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,440
for various different reasons

1427
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,440
Man she doesn't want to be on the internet anymore

1428
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,400
uh

1429
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:42,840
Trixie obviously is just gone and we don't like her so she's not invited

1430
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:50,760
Tom would would would show up. I maybe Nate would show up probably if there was like it was nicely organized

1431
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,120
and

1432
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,120
potentially Jesse

1433
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,920
But like as a stretch

1434
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,120
I think if it was a big enough deal and we asked

1435
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:06,680
He may show up at some point, but I I don't know. I have no idea what he feels about the state of the pcp at the moment

1436
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:13,720
Wait, I'm being I'm being rude on twitter again. Oh god dang it

1437
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,560
Okay, good. Um my um, I have spewed. I have spewed my bile

1438
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,040
on twitter

1439
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,280
And uh, I will probably continue to do so

1440
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:25,800
um

1441
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,040
Anyway, the next voicemail is called

1442
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,160
addressing only the maddest niggas

1443
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,760
Uh, okay three two one go

1444
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:40,120
Few absolute maniacs who are really listening to the pcp from the start

1445
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,280
Uh, could maybe just all of the kindness of your high

1446
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,760
um compile

1447
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,280
A list of all the times they talk about homestuck

1448
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,480
Uh, or Andrew hersey

1449
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,040
They send it to me

1450
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:01,080
Or just, you know, put it on the comments. I would appreciate it very much

1451
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:08,440
What does he really want for that info did you understand did you understand the question? What was the question?

1452
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,440
Yeah, he was he's saying to

1453
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,200
addressing like mad people in the pcp audience

1454
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,680
If you could get all of the instances of the progress and they just talking about homestuck or Andrew

1455
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,800
Hussie and then telling him in the comments all of them

1456
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:26,760
I we talk about that's so many times over the entire

1457
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,040
Like of the podcast so that's a lot of

1458
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,760
timestamps

1459
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,920
I don't know what they plan to do with it

1460
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:43,640
Uh, I don't by the way, this this this is the guy that i'm pretty sure called into the anamorphon time

1461
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,960
Podcast that one time this this is the voice that i'm almost positive

1462
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:54,840
Called into the chris grinds episode of that. Uh, so if you've if you've heard that episode of anamorphon time

1463
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,160
Let me know if you think it's the same guy. I'm pretty sure it's the same guy

1464
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:00,840
um

1465
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:06,040
Next voicemail is called boris j 3 2 1 go

1466
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:11,720
Ben do you realize a lot of pcp viewers also listen to the dick show?

1467
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,640
Uh, I'm sure some of them do

1468
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:21,240
I feel like uh, what am I supposed to do about it the vast majority of those who

1469
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,880
Enjoy the dick show probably don't enjoy the pcp, but maybe they do

1470
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:34,840
Except when politics comes up. I don't know. I'm sure I'm sure there's some crossover. I mean, you know a lot of people who

1471
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:41,800
Listen to the pcp were digi fans and digi shielded the the dick show a lot. So like yeah

1472
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,840
I don't know man. What whatever

1473
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,440
I don't agree. I don't like the dick show, but like

1474
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,800
What's to be done?

1475
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,400
uh

1476
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:59,400
Next voicemail is a tweet. Um, here i'll i'll post the tweet in the

1477
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,520
Server

1478
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:06,760
Oh, is it um coming up? Why is it not a typo?

1479
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:13,960
Uh, sorry the link doesn't work. Sorry, buddy. Let me try again. Um

1480
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,480
Next next voicemail is called fuck Ralph

1481
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:21,160
Three two one go. Huh? What you there?

1482
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:25,000
That's good. Okay. Okay. Three two one go

1483
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,480
So we don't have any friends. So I just decided to like ramble into the void

1484
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,960
Aka like your ears

1485
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,960
I just watched the Ralph the movie maker video about linkara and

1486
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,920
I don't know about linkara. I don't know if he's like

1487
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:46,360
Bad person or like cringe or base because I'm not the fucking nerd

1488
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,160
But like that video that might as well be

1489
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,640
like the

1490
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,640
Ralph's embodiment of

1491
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,440
Trixie going on that podcast and basically just projecting all over floors

1492
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:06,840
Because this smug little asshole like he made four. I think four movies that all fucking suck

1493
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
He charged like 20

1494
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
30 dollars for them on blu-ray

1495
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:16,600
Yeah, like funding for them and they fucking sucked ass and he has the audacity

1496
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,560
To to mock like another person

1497
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,600
for acting

1498
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,040
badly

1499
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:29,400
Like he acts any better that fucking rat face little fuck. I hope he's fucking

1500
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,560
Wait, so you're talking about Ethan Ralph, right?

1501
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,800
No, he's talking about Ralph the movie maker. Oh, he charged

1502
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,480
So he charged 40 dollars for a shitty DVD of of what?

1503
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,680
Of well movies he's made I guess

1504
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,520
Oh

1505
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,520
And yet and yet he courtesizes linkara's movie. I think

1506
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,840
The hypocrisy I I don't feel like that's that's fine. Did linkara make a movie?

1507
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,880
I guess

1508
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:03,640
Well, I mean if this guy thinks that Ralph the movie maker made worse movies than linkara

1509
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,480
Then I mean that's a pretty strong claim. Well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I haven't seen linkara's movies

1510
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,480
I kind of assume they're not good

1511
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,840
Linkara is a bit of a cringe individual, but you know, they they make the type of

1512
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,240
Things that their audience enjoys if this guy is saying that like

1513
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:27,080
Linkara gave better value for money unlike the like he gave he gave it at a more reasonable price

1514
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,960
and all that

1515
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:35,400
I mean, I'm fair enough. I feel like this guy thinks that linkara gave a better product

1516
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:41,880
Yeah, I I don't know. I think well, he says he doesn't know about linkara

1517
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:46,120
So he's coming at it from like Ralph the movie maker makes bad movies and yet

1518
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,120
criticizes them

1519
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,640
Which I think is

1520
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,320
It's I don't find that to be a problem if somebody makes a bad movie

1521
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,840
I mean, I'd like red letter media and space cop was terrible

1522
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,360
It was not a good movie and yet they they think they can talk about movies

1523
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,440
Hmm. Yeah

1524
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:14,600
I mean, you don't necessarily have to be you don't necessarily have to be a great movie a great filmmaker to criticize movie

1525
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:20,440
You don't whatever they always say you don't have to be a great chef to like, you know, know if food tastes good or whatever

1526
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,800
Uh, yeah, I mean

1527
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:30,920
I don't know too much about Ralph the movie maker if two people make you good videos

1528
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:33,080
So if two and biased, I guess

1529
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,440
I've seen a couple Ralph the movie maker videos and I guess they're fine

1530
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:43,960
Um, if two people each make a shitty movie and then they each point to each other's shitty movie and they're like that movie sucks

1531
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
I guess they're both right

1532
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Yeah, they can both be right

1533
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,240
Uh

1534
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,520
Yeah

1535
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,520
I don't know

1536
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,920
Seems like linkara doesn't really

1537
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,760
Criticize people a lot seems like linkara takes it personally

1538
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:07,080
When like other internet people like say his stuff is bad and he like doesn't really do that he like

1539
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,760
Gets pissy and like complains about other people who are like too critical seems to be

1540
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,360
His thing but so which is which is okay. I mean it seems like he he doesn't dish it

1541
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,880
Because he can't take it which is fair enough. Honestly, it's valid. It's perfectly valid

1542
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,760
um

1543
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,680
Okay

1544
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,640
Yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen any of these movies. So I don't fucking know

1545
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,320
um

1546
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,360
Next voicemail is called ppr

1547
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,920
pcp public radio

1548
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,920
three two one go

1549
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:45,800
From member station wflg. I'm sydney norman with your weekly roundup

1550
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:52,520
This week's story the trial for kyle written house continued with an explosive day on wednesday as written house took the stand for cross examination

1551
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,680
Written house began crying during his testimony describing how he improperly used a weapon

1552
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,120
He intentionally brought with him to a volatile situation and the community is not a part of

1553
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,960
This prompted judge bruce schroeder to admonish prosecuting attorney thomas binger for asking written house questions

1554
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,160
Judge schroeder then called a recess and told written house to use quote bruce's big brave boy

1555
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,560
And that written house earned an extra hour tv time that night

1556
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:19,880
It wasn't long after the court had returned from recess that judge schroeder threatened to hold binger in contempt for referring to the individuals

1557
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,960
Their in-house shot has people

1558
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:27,000
Bitcoin up 4 3 i'm up 2 xrp up 2 this is bpr

1559
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,200
Another another beautiful day in the neighborhood

1560
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,400
Yeah, yeah, this is what i'm talking about

1561
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:44,600
That was that was half factual and the part that wasn't factual was just was just extrapolating from the existing facts of the case

1562
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,160
Uh, that's pretty much how it how it is

1563
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,720
uh

1564
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,720
bummer

1565
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:53,880
Okay, next voicemail is called it's true

1566
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,680
3 2 1 go

1567
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,720
Shred it

1568
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Shred it what

1569
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,920
Shred it raped my dog

1570
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:11,320
What is that what they're saying? I think he's saying shredded raped my dog

1571
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,240
Oh, yeah, I guess that they might be saying that

1572
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,080
Uh, I guess it's true because they put four exclamation points. Yeah, that's what

1573
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,800
That's what convinced me

1574
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,080
Um next one is called

1575
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,480
Okay, there's no voicemail. It's just called. Why is the header of the pcp website so

1576
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,280
enormous

1577
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,360
And the answer like that

1578
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:42,520
I don't think that's true. The answer is that it's just like a default template and that's how big the template's header was

1579
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,000
Uh

1580
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,520
Yeah, we have a picture of a cactus

1581
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:50,120
We have a picture of a succulent on our website because by the way

1582
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:56,760
Okay, we got to change the the the description of the episodes because apparently the the episode descriptions still link to the like the um

1583
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,720
the mp3

1584
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:05,160
Like google drive folder, which is no longer updated if you want the episode mp3 is you got to go to the website now

1585
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:11,640
The episode mp3s are all available on the website. That is where we upload them now. So we should change the description

1586
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,800
Change there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1587
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,000
um

1588
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,360
Okay, that's uh, that's that uh, next

1589
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,960

um

1598
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:55,480
Ben, I would like to know your thoughts on infinitely just in in the fossil walls

1599
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:02,520
I know you comment about them before the podcast. I remember that and I know it's it's a comic, but I

1600
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,240
I don't remember

1601
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:11,400
The details or what you actually think about the the book and the fossil was I have the book in my hands right now

1602
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,360
Um, kisses. I love you guys

1603
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:25,240
The um, I have only I haven't read that much David Foster walls. I've read infinite jest and I've read um

1604
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
One or two of his articles

1605
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,920
Or his short stories rather like I read um

1606
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,720
I think it's called like

1607
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,960
A very fun thing. I'll never do again the one where he goes on the cruise ship

1608
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,920
Uh, that one's kind of good

1609
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,600
It's cool. I guess

1610
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
um infinite jest

1611
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,080
Oh, I've seen I've seen the movie

1612
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,640
based on uh

1613
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,840
Is it called um portraits of hideous men?

1614
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:58,440
I haven't read that story, but I've I've I've seen the movie based on it and I

1615
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,080
Thought it was all right

1616
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:03,960
The infinite jest book is really long

1617
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,680
It's probably too long

1618
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:10,840
It it drags it points it took me like a whole year to read it

1619
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,800
uh the the like

1620
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:21,400
The thing with like the footnotes and like the huge indexes at the end is very it's pretty annoying actually like having to flip

1621
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,280
Having to keep two bookmarks and like flip back and forth through

1622
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:30,120
The whole book is very irritating. It doesn't I don't like it, but it is what it is

1623
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:33,880
Uh, but like there's scenes from the book that I remember

1624
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:38,120
Years later that I that I have retained and I found

1625
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,920
Interesting, so I guess

1626
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:43,560
I guess it was worth reading because it left me with

1627
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,560
impressions

1628
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,560
So would I recommend it?

1629
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,560
Yeah, uh

1630
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:55,880
What what else can I say it's uh it had interesting ideas in it even if it was pretty bloated

1631
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:01,560
Oh, okay, uh next next voicemail is called ben saint

1632
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,360
I don't know how to

1633
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
I don't know how to speak french

1634
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
three two one go

1635
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:19,960
My accent is brazilian. You guys have uh, ben you have come down my accent one or two times. It's it's brazilian. I'm from brazil

1636
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:28,040
I I thought it was south american, so I was in the right ballpark

1637
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,880
um

1638
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,880
Next

1639
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:39,560
This reminds me in a in a mental game of telephone. I just played as my neurons were reaching out and touching each other and wriggling around

1640
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:42,920
Uh, that reminds me that one of my roommates is brazilian

1641
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:47,640
Which reminds me of one of my other roommates who I have never even barely talked to

1642
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,560
Who I heard this week listening to tim pool

1643
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,360
in the fucking kitchen

1644
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:59,560
And tim pool was going on some unhinged, uh, kyle riddenhouse shit

1645
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,840
And I just want to say

1646
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,640
It makes me really mad and I hate that guy

1647
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:08,200
Uh, that's all

1648
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
I have to say about that. Oh

1649
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,400
Oh, the the thing the title of that

1650
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,120
Translates to I will eat your ass

1651
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,320
If you come as sick. Oh

1652
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,440
Yeah, that sounds

1653
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:27,160
Oh, that must be portuguese then portuguese. Yes. Yeah, well

1654
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,800
Because actually

1655
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,960
Which is basically just which is basically just a mix of french and spanish as far as as far as I'm concerned

1656
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,800
And I don't care to learn

1657
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:40,360
Any more about it that might prove that wrong

1658
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:46,840
Uh, it's spanish adjacent literally. I mean, yeah next one is an imjer link

1659
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,240
Okay, I like this one roll video

1660
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:59,720
I'm Trixie. This is a Trixie Trixie's crunchy roll video getting 10k views. Oh man

1661
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,360
I like that they use the uh

1662
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,600
The the toothless thumbnail

1663
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:12,200
Yeah, Trixie's a crunchy roll video did did pretty good like for modern day Trixie, which is to say that it cracked 10k views

1664
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,320
Whoo

1665
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,320
Yeah, wow

1666
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,400
Um

1667
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,760
That was her that was her big sir her her big her

1668
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:29,320
Her big shot the big the big move there is like mining old digi

1669
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
Stuff for like new

1670
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,800
Takes about it referencing and uh

1671
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:40,920
And uh remixing and regurgitating. It's sort of worked a little bit

1672
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:44,920
Um good for her I guess

1673
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,800
The next one is uh, oh man, this is doing numbers

1674
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:53,080
Next one is called nnn week three

1675
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,800
three two one go

1676
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:00,840
We're going on two weeks now and I gotta admit I did struggle a bit this week

1677
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:06,840
I was on twitter checking out the latest benzane tweet when I saw a natweet on my timeline

1678
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,720
Saying he was about to start streaming on twitch

1679
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:15,640
My mouse hovered over the link for an uncomfortable amount of time before I worked up the courage to do something

1680
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,200
That would have seemed impossible years ago

1681
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:24,280
I unfollowed nate anyone who takes no nate november seriously should probably do the same

1682
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,080
Unfollow and unsubscribe from nate

1683
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:34,360
Stay strong no nate nation if and as always no nate. Yes watch if you if you are playing with fire

1684
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:41,160
If you're still following nate if if you are serious about no nate november if you're serious about no nate november I would have to agree

1685
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:46,760
Being subscribed and following is is definitely yeah playing with fire

1686
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:51,480
There's uh, there's no there's no question there. Hey man, stay strong

1687
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:56,120
You know, I know it's rough. It's tough out there for a no nater

1688
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,440
um

1689
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,680
But uh, we're in we're all in this together

1690
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:06,120
Uh, we here we have committed to a no nate during november

1691
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:09,160
Lifestyle here. We are we are an eight free zone

1692
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:15,880
Uh for november and uh, perhaps ever, uh, we will see

1693
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,480
Next voicemail and this is the last voicemail

1694
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,520
Mercifully is called giraffe titty

1695
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,240
three two one go

1696
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:30,360
Shut up then. Just shut shut it shut up

1697
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,720
Okay, okay. Sorry

1698
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,520
Well, I guess I will because the podcast is over so

1699
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,680
Yeah, was this in reference to my first sona?

1700
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:46,600
Uh, oh, yeah, I did I your giraffe sona I

1701
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,560
Do I don't think I mean I don't think so

1702
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
What would be the connection there?

1703
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:54,360
The giraffe has titties

1704
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,800
I would have thought

1705
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:59,240
Okay, it would be about that. But maybe yeah, I would I would have thought so too

1706
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,720
But it's just a guy telling me to shut up

1707
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,680
So, well, I don't know man

1708
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,120
I don't get it. I don't get it

1709
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,160
Duh

1710
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,440
I guess one thing I didn't mention is those little

1711
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,920
Hands drawn oh like mouse drawn commissions. I did

1712
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:28,520
I've stopped doing them because I don't like having responsibilities of any kind. Um, yeah, absolutely pretty cool

1713
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:37,160
People like those these cute little little things go to twitter.com find my twitter. It's the best one. It's the only good one

1714
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,640
Yeah, find it find it somewhere in there. Just find it. Just not gonna tell you where

1715
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:46,920
It's the needle in a haystack, but when I'm gonna let leave it up to you to find it

1716
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:49,240
So that when you do you'll have more satisfaction

1717
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,640
You'll get you really get a get that dope of me and you go. Yes. I get it

1718
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:59,720
I love uh games that have exploration and what better way to exemplify that love

1719
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:04,200
Than to just tell you to look for it idiot. I have um

1720
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,600
I haven't played noida in like a while. I think I just I've

1721
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:11,160
I've basically quit noida

1722
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:15,320
Well, honestly good. I played way too much of it played way too much of that fucking game

1723
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:22,760
But it's probably it's probably good that I'm that I haven't played it in a while. It's it's good. Um, it's good. I'm free. I'm free

1724
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,720
