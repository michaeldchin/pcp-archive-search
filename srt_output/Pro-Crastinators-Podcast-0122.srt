00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,160
guy ever, aka Ross, and today we're joined by Munchy.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Hey guys, it's me, Joey. I want to let you know that I am really funny. Just trust me

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,320
on this one. I say things that don't make sense and I am stupid. Please laugh.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
Tom is here.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Hi, my name is...

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
A.K. Rachel.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
He is totally Rachel.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,140
I don't know what we're talking about. Fuck this shit.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,240
Jennifer Aniston had the best career of any of them, so things are looking up for you,

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Tom, in the long run.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Alright, I got decent tits, too.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Accurate.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
You don't know she's a guy.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Speaking of decent tits, here's Hippo, A.K. Monica.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
No, no, wrong.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Just Monica.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
No?

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
No.

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
No, no, you're Phoebe. You're definitely Phoebe.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,080
I was trying to think of what they are called. That's the only one I know, Phoebe, because

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,240
she says something and people laugh afterwards, so I assume that is...

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
She's funny.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Yeah, she's like, what's a fridge? What's a fridge, guys?

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
And people are like, she doesn't know what a fridge is.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,160
I just keep my food in organic ice chambers.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Dude, that's not totally me.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Dude, that's Moana.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah, that's true.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
And then the actual Monica.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Monica.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Mage.

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,160
The only Monica I remember is from Doki Doki Literature Club.

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
They're the same character, a little known fact.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,160
We literally have a PCP theme contest when our theme is, I'll be there for you.

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Oh my God, I almost forgot to say, hey, hope you enjoyed that intro song that was the

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
new PCP theme, everybody.

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,160
There was no intro song because that was a cold open when we were talking about this.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Fade into the thing.

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,160
And now we'll go to the theme right now. Boom.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Connie, I know. What is this? You're supposed to be working right now.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm sorry, darling. I'm listening to the PCP right now.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
It's so interesting.

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
And now we're back.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
We'll play two times. Don't worry.

46
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
That would be good, actually.

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Yeah, maybe we should experiment with cold openings more.

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I don't know. Okay, well, whatever. Hello, everyone. Hope you're doing well.

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Hope your week's been good. Glad to see you. Glad to know you.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Congratulations to Sasuke Pro, by the way, for winning the contest again.

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Thank you for doing this to me. You've made my life infinitely worse.

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,160
You have recommended me a laptop that has Windows 10 on it.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
And I asked you. I asked you specifically, like, two times, is Windows 10 evil

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,160
slash a scam? And you said two times, no, you should get it.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,160
You should get Windows 10. And I have it. And I can conclude that it is indeed a scam

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
and I am brainwashed thanks to you.

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Oh, well, sure. I would love more explanation on that so I can thoroughly destroy that argument.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Yeah, Munch, I think when I got Windows 10 on my new computer, I've been using 7 for a long time,

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
I figured out ways to turn off most of the more insidious features of Windows 10,

60
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
which was good.

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Okay, I open up Windows 10. And the first thing during it's like setup phase

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,160
is just asking me outright. Keep in mind this is asking me so I can turn it off,

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
like, thanks for letting me turn it off.

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,160
But just the fact that it is opening upon, like, do you want us to track everything that you do

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,160
and give you ads on your computer? Like, not anyone's been on your computer?

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Just strike one.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Then second, I try to go install Google Chrome and then it won't...

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Big mistake.

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,160
It, like, it asked me, I think, like, three times first when I Google search Google Chrome.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Like, when I am in the search bar, I am Google searching Google Chrome.

71
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
It's like, hey, can you do that? Microsoft Edge is better.

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I go down to Google Chrome and I start to open.

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Hey, did you know that Microsoft Edge is better?

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I go to set it as default. Hey, by the way, just want to let you know you should not be using this software you downloaded.

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,160
You should be using our software because this is how we send the subliminal messages to your spinal cord to make you buy more products.

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,160
I go to, I have to download, like, Classic Shell because the, like, normal, like, what was it called?

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
The little icon down the bottom left.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I open that. There's, like, ads for fucking, like, Disney and Minecraft built in.

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Wait, I can undo that?

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
That's like, that's been, like, the worst thing. I fucking hate it.

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Dude, you have to install Classic Shell.

82
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
It just puts the Windows 7 menu back on there. It's great.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Damn, I want that real bad.

84
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,160
What is this problem? I haven't seen any ads. What are you talking about?

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Well, do you have Windows 10?

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Yes.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,160
If you click the little start menu on the bottom left, like, I get, like, right now, I get, like, Royal Revolve 2.

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
I am pretty sure you can disable those.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Yeah.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
You can disable those as you dig in the menus.

91
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Okay, I should probably do that then.

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I just, like, the design of Classic Shell better.

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I'm sure most of the, I mean, I've turned off most of those things.

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,160
But the fact that they were there in the first place makes me not be able to trust it whatsoever.

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Yeah, I would never be able to trust Windows 10 because it has Disney ads for it.

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Have you trusted an operating system in the first place?

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
I mean, they're all fair enough.

98
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I feel like when I turn on my computer that has Windows 7, I'm not instantly going to be reported to the NSA.

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Not for, like, when I Google search something, I know Google's gonna give me to the NSA.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,160
But I feel like when I turn, like, press the on button on my computer, I'm not being catalogued in a do not fly list.

101
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
That's how I feel when I turn on Windows 10.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm terrified of the dystopian nightmare that is clearly being foreshadowed here by, like, the fact that these, like, specific ads are here.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Like, I know that Windows is a Microsoft product, but, like, I gotta think here, it says, like, buy Minecraft for Xbox.

104
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Like, that's in my start window right here on Windows 10.

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Like, what if they just turn, what if they just get rid of the switch to turn off these ads, which will happen one day?

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
You know, and then we're fucked.

107
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Oh, yeah. I mean, well, Microsoft's always gonna be looking out for their own shit.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:20,160
The reason, like, Windows 10 is such a clusterfuck is because the new CEO of Microsoft is, like, trying to pivot their entire business away from selling Windows licenses and making them everything I paid service.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Windows doesn't cost, like, forever, Windows didn't cost, like, money, like, Windows 10.

110
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Like, for, like, two years, they're like, just take it, just take it, because they're trying to build a database like Google's.

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,160
So they're just, like, doing the same thing Google does on the web, just on your computer.

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Yeah, so, like, that's just the modern way.

113
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,160
If you want to, like, get rid of that, we all just have to go become fucking woke as shit and just use a little bit of Linux.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,160
This is why, this is why Adblock is actually, like, a really good societal thing.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,160
It's not just that it's, like, you know, a nice convenience, like, I don't want to see ads and you can block them.

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:07,160
The fact that so many people use it all the time puts them in the mindset that seeing ads is bad, because if ads were all over the place, all the time, your whole life,

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,160
you would have, like, generations of people that were, like, conditioned to expect ads everywhere and, like, the inability to turn them off.

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,160
This blows my mind to shits. I always forget about it until I accidentally go on a, uh, go on without an ad blocker.

119
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Do you know the YouTube.com homepage has a giant banner ad above all your recommended videos?

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Yeah, I, yeah, would I ever go on my mom's, like, like, laptop for whatever reason.

121
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I did that the other day to fucking, be, be, be, be, be, my phone was dead and I had to check my email for something.

122
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I went on there and I checked YouTube for a second and there's a huge giant ad for, like, some car thing, just, like, covering the entire screen.

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Yeah, just, like, can you, I can't imagine using the internet like that.

124
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Like, you, you poor peasants out there who don't know what we're talking about.

125
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I feel so bad for you and you're unenlightened lives.

126
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Like, how, how are you not just, like, in a Mercedes Benz right now?

127
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
You've been brainwashed by these giant ads.

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm gonna try to put an ad blocker right now and I'm gonna look at, I'm gonna look at square in the fucking eye right now.

129
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Staring at the beast.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,160
I heard rumors a while ago that, like, ad blog was taking bribes for certain ad companies to own certain ads.

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Ad block plus is. That's why I don't use ad block plus anymore.

132
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I have, like, three or four different ad blocks.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
You block origin represent.

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,160
We all just need to get a VPN. That's, that's how you really.

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
What is that? I don't know what that is.

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It basically, it masks your IP address and stuff so, like, the companies don't know where you are or what you're looking for.

137
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,160
It, like, blocks your internet, like, shit.

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,160
But what, can I still set up my Minecraft server with my IP?

139
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm sure you can. Yeah.

140
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Well, thank you.

141
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I've been needing to get one of those for a long time.

142
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,160
We need, we need to get the PCP sponsored by private internet access because they give out sponsorships to everybody.

143
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
We need to get the PCP on fucking...

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I've seen plenty of ads for, like, on Tim Pool and stuff.

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Who's, who's a bigger, who's a bigger defender of free speech than the podcast that drops racial epithets,

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
like, every episode. That's true.

147
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
We need it more than anybody. They'll partner with us for sure.

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
We're on this page.

149
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Bener.

150
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
There you go.

151
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
There's your pledge for the day.

152
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Is that against people who wear beanies?

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah.

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
That's always been the fucking weakest one I've ever heard of.

155
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah, that's incredibly tepid.

156
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
So, so fucking weak.

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
What is the origin of that even?

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,160
As, as the person who Bener refers to is not, like, that's, that's no, that is not, that's not compared.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Oh, I see.

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I've heard that, like, also, like, like, I know Jap.

161
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Like, the weird, the weird thing about Jap is it is simply an abbreviation of an actual word,

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,160
but it's more about the way you say it that makes it a film or not.

163
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
That's not, that's not with Jap. That's with every slur.

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I guess you're right, I guess you're right.

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
That's all context. Everyone's just a fucking coward.

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,160
That's, that's why I unabbreviate Jap to Japan.

167
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,160
So I say to people that Japan over there.

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,160
And then for some reason it's, it's silly enough that people don't even mind.

169
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Oh, Mage posted one in the chat I really like.

170
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Probably because she doesn't want to say it, which is understandable.

171
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
But Zipperhead, I've always liked the word Zipperhead.

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Oh, like the guy from Rainbow, the TV show.

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,160
It's, I see it in like, in like, Vietnam films.

174
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
They call them Zipper, I don't know, I'm gonna Google it.

175
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I have never heard this before in my life.

176
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I think it's from because, like, um, something about crushing heads I don't remember.

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh, okay, well that's pretty rough.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Alright, look, here, I'm gonna go into Urban Dictionary.

179
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Let me read it real quick.

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
This guy right here.

181
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Whoa!

182
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
That guy's a Zipperhead, yeah.

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Or, hey, remember that guy from One Piece who had a zipper mouth?

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Remember that guy?

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Yeah.

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
From Chinese Lobby.

187
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
I have an OC that has a zipper mouth.

188
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Damn, look at Ross.

189
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
I just like to point out Mage posted that in the chat, then immediately deleted it.

190
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Got to cover her tracks.

191
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
She's not using the VPN yet.

192
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
That's true.

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah.

194
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,160
We're running Windows 10 Honor right now.

195
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Alright, listen to this.

196
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Oh, shit.

197
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay, this is pretty fucked up.

198
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Alright, Zipperhead.

199
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
A derogatory term in reference to people of Asian descent.

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,160
It is said to have been coined during the Korean War by frontline troops who had run

201
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
over enemy troops in Jeeps.

202
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,160
The soldiers claimed that the tire tracks from the Jeeps left a pattern resembling that

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
of a closed zipper along the corpse.

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Holy fuck.

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Okay, that's pretty fucking brutal.

206
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I have no idea.

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,160
That's what I'm talking about.

208
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
What race is this for?

209
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I mean, it's just generally Asian, apparently, but I mean, it was done during the Korean

210
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,160
War, apparently, so maybe it's specifically Korean?

211
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I don't know.

212
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Nonetheless, it sounds cool, but so therefore I like it.

213
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
But it's not something you want to be, I don't think.

214
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't want to be one personally, but I want to know a Zipperhead, you know?

215
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I want to be around him.

216
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm trying to have a great conversation.

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
With his crushed in skull.

218
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Yes.

219
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,160
He's a great listener, let me tell you.

220
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Munchie is posting Joe...

221
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
This is Ross.

222
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
God damn it.

223
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah, this is fucking Ross.

224
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
God damn it, hippo.

225
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
You really are the moniker.

226
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,160
You've shown your truth and you are the moniker.

227
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
No, no, listen to me.

228
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Are you saying that it is a bad thing to have not watched enough friends to know who the

229
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
fuck's name is?

230
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
No, okay.

231
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I would never claim that you must watch friends under any circumstance.

232
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
But all I'm saying is that...

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
All the way to the bank.

235
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
That's his name.

236
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,160
David Schwimmer, not swimmer, but swimmer.

237
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Schwimmer is a God actor.

238
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,160
It's something akin to a God orgasm, watching Ross on television.

239
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Just watching fuck of his life episode after episode.

240
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
He's like a modern day jug head.

241
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
He's like a modern day Ku Klux Klan, like, birth of a patient.

242
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
He's a modern day court jester.

243
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
He's a modern day zipper head.

244
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,160
He's out here every day getting fucking run over emotionally by women.

245
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
I can't say no more.

246
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
David Schwimmer's going to become an instell in real life.

247
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Oh no.

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
He probably led the instell movement.

249
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Can you imagine, like, I can't imagine that someone like Elliot Roger wouldn't watch an

250
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
episode of Friends.

251
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,160
See just what happens to Ross every episode and be like, you know what?

252
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Women are evil and they do need to be subjugated.

253
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Well, hold on.

254
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Like, it's understandable.

255
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Hold on.

256
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Okay.

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
After I post this image of him in a potato suit, there's something even more pressing

258
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
here.

259
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Yeah.

260
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
All right, all right, all right.

261
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,160
What you just said, you say that he's an instell, you know, he's behind Elliot Roger.

262
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Yeah.

263
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
He's behind, you know, the hand just saying the hook shooting.

264
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I see this.

265
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Right.

266
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
There he is.

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,160
He's a confirmed affiliate.

268
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,160
One of the rare instances of a young monkey hang out with Elliot Roger.

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
There it is.

270
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
There it is.

271
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
My God.

272
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
The connection's confirmed.

273
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
All right.

274
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
This fucking topic sucks.

275
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Get off of this.

276
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Okay.

277
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
All right.

278
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
But let's go on to the one.

279
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Can you explain to me why Monica?

280
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Because you're a bossy and you always tell me what to do and you're all nagging.

281
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
You're all nagging.

282
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
No other things.

283
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Because I don't know.

285
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Yeah.

286
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
What do you say?

287
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
All I remember from Monica is that...

288
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Nothing.

289
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Nothing.

290
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
There's nothing.

291
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
She was like a bossy bitch kind of.

292
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
And she, you know, kind of bossed around Chandler.

293
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
We were talking about the government.

294
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Yes.

295
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
You could have been like, ah, well, anyone who knows TIN is the government.

296
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Haha.

297
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I wanted to see where the Ross train left us.

298
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Yeah, there was a lot of gold to mine from that topic.

299
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay.

300
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
All right.

301
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
That's a cool topic.

302
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah.

303
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Because I was out walking, as I often do, playing a Pokemon Go.

304
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
And this is not about Pokemon Go.

305
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,160
But the point of mentioning it is that I was at a gym and I was fighting a raid.

306
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
So I was standing in a place and I didn't really want to leave.

307
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,160
And this guy comes up and he just sort of stands near me and he just starts ranting

308
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
into the air.

309
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Like he's not looking at me.

310
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
He just starts ranting into the air like crazy things.

311
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Like the world's fucked up, man.

312
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
The government's fucked up.

313
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Ah, this is so bad.

314
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
You can't even get a good fish anymore.

315
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,160
You've had your first crazy person playing Pokemon Go.

316
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Congratulations.

317
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Yeah.

318
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
It was great.

319
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,160
And he started ranting and stuff and he, you know, I was standing there not running away.

320
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
So he assumed I was okay with it.

321
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,160
And he didn't seem that like, he wasn't like a homeless person.

322
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
He didn't stink.

323
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
He had a backpack on.

324
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I assumed he was just sort of, you know, having a bit of a moment.

325
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Sure.

326
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,160
So he was ranting about like the government and then he started ranting about fish and

327
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,160
how like you could get good fish if you just, you know, you put the salt on it and you get

328
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
it from the plate.

329
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I wasn't really paying attention.

330
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,160
But he was going on about like living off the land and how it's so much better to live

331
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,160
off the land and to rely on like government stuff and the bureaucracy and stuff.

332
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
And the more he was talking, like he was getting closer and closer to me, like looking at me

333
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
every so often and saying, do you understand?

334
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Right?

335
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
You understand?

336
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
And he was getting closer and closer.

337
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,160
But I started to understand where he was coming from.

338
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,160
He was just like, he said he was, you know, originally from Portugal and he came over

339
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
because of like some sort of problems.

340
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm assuming like monetary and his brother lived in England and he came over and he was

341
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,160
like, he was ranting about like having to be on customer service calls for three hours

342
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
and you're like, you don't want to do that with your life, man.

343
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
You don't want to do that.

344
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
And I was like, yeah, you don't want to do that.

345
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Fuck customer service.

346
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Fuck being on the phone.

347
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Fuck doing all of this bureaucracy, getting letters in the mail and the bills.

348
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
By the end, we were like best friends.

349
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,160
We were like talking about how everything sucks about the government.

350
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
And it was just putting me into perspective because I don't know people like that who

351
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,160
like live in, you know, a more, not squalor, but like, you know, he was from Portugal

352
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
and he had a very simple life where he caught fish or something.

353
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Sure.

354
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,160
And he had a small community of people that he all, you know, he talked to everybody

355
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,160
where he lives and now he's in England and there's, he doesn't know anybody.

356
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
He doesn't like anybody.

357
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,160
He doesn't like the whole system and all the bills you have to pay.

358
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
It's very impersonal.

359
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Sure.

360
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I could feel.

361
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,160
And it was just like, yeah, I feel that.

362
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I feel that a lot.

363
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
And it was interesting to see that perspective.

364
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,160
And I was thinking about like, what happens?

365
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,160
What happens if you just go away and don't come back?

366
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
What happens if you just...

367
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
If you just like to live off the land?

368
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Because there's another thing that is related to this is my brother, my littlest brother,

369
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,160
has been like, he recently volunteered for a thing to just do some work for a guy and

370
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,160
the, you know, you would get paid in food and shelter.

371
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,160
And he went for a week to just help this guy build a house on some land that he bought

372
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
and he just, he doesn't have the money to hire builders.

373
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
So, you know, there's like a site you can go to.

374
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Okay.

375
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,160
You can volunteer to just go and live in a place for a bit and help a guy and get food.

376
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,160
And it's like, you know, initially when I heard that, I was like, ah, that's crazy talk.

377
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
You know, what are you going to do when you come back, huh?

378
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah.

379
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
You're not going to have any work done.

380
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,160
But the more I think about it and like this crazy guy, I'm like, that's all you really

381
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
need.

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,160
You only really need like food, like reliable source of food, water and shelter.

383
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,160
And doing all this volunteer stuff and like living off the land and living just within

384
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
your means is like really cool.

385
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Because what he was looking at a thing on the site where he got the first volunteer thing

386
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,160
and there's this guy who wants like a photographer, this Italian like guy who owns an island.

387
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,160
And he's like, I want a guy to like photograph this place and do some like, you know, do some

388
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,160
live music for this thing to like, to, you know, for advertising for, you know, a resort

389
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
or whatever.

390
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,160
And if you were to do that, all you need to do is you pay for your own travel, but you

391
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,160
basically get a free holiday in this really lovely place and all it costs is a bit of

392
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
like menial labor.

393
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
And it's like, yeah.

394
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,160
He owns an island, that's cheaper than, at least pay for the ticket, gosh darn.

395
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I mean, I guess he's not paying despite owning an island.

396
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
That is kind of strange.

397
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Well, I don't know whether he owns an island.

398
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
I can't remember.

399
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Okay, fair enough.

400
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
The idea is nice.

401
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Like even if you have to pay for travel, there's lots of places within like, you know, in

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
England, like kind of local where you can pay a small fee to get a coach drive out into

403
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
the middle of nowhere.

404
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,160
And then you can, you can, you know, you see a lovely holiday destination.

405
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,160
But can't you do that without having to do manual labor?

406
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Well, you'd need a place to stay, you'd need a place to live, you'd need a place to buy

407
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
things.

408
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
But like if you're volunteering and a guy just has food and shelter for you, like, yeah.

409
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Isn't this the relationship they used to have between Lord and Surf?

410
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Are we bringing it back?

411
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
I don't know.

412
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I was just, I was just thinking about all that stuff a lot recently because of those,

413
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
those instances.

414
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,160
I like the idea of making life as simple as possible.

415
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I think, I think there's too much unnecessary complexity in modern living.

416
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I mean, not to say that I'm against modernity.

417
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I think there's a lot of good things that modern innovation has brought us like the

418
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,160
internet that allows us to do this show and give us money and live.

419
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Yep.

420
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,160
But just in general, I feel like there's so much, there's so much bureaucratic minutiae,

421
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,160
so much bullshit that's been attached to this steady stream of progress that I desperately

422
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,160
wish to escape because it doesn't interest me and it doesn't affect me in anything but

423
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
a negative way and I don't like it.

424
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Such as?

425
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Yeah.

426
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,160
But what about the whole internet thing that is like how you wish to live your life?

427
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Right.

428
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
You know, that's pretty good.

429
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I just said, that's why I just said the internet is a good thing.

430
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,160
But you can't just separate that one thing from the rest of like bureaucracy in general.

431
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
It's all part of the same machine.

432
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,160
No, I think the thing I was going on really is not that bureaucracy is bad because I don't

433
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
want to have to deal with everything in my life like other people to do like secretary

434
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:02,160
things like Nate does with the paying us and it's like, but I feel like certain authorities

435
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:09,160
are stupid and like especially councils and the government of an entire country.

436
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
It just is all stupid.

437
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
It doesn't work.

438
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,160
They sound like extremely broad generalizations that are not.

439
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
I got a story about it.

440
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm not like, I don't have like a political like stance that I've even thought about.

441
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,160
It's just like a feeling I have because when I was at uni, first year, I was in like a

442
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,160
house rather than a student accommodation owned by the university and when you do that,

443
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,160
landlord has to register that there's a person living at the premises and then the council

444
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,160
is notified and then if you don't say that you're a student, they will expect you to

445
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,160
pay council tax and all that sort of stuff.

446
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,160
What the university does, you write a form and then you give it to the university and

447
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,160
the university will give it to the council to make sure that you are confirmed a student

448
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
and have to pay it.

449
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,160
For whatever reason, that didn't work on one of the years and since I was like living

450
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,160
alone away from parents for the first time and it was all sort of like a big thing and

451
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,160
I didn't really want to go to them for help, but I was also really, really scared because

452
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I got like a court issue notice in the mail and I was looking at it and like, you have

453
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,160
to appear at court at this date because you have not paid your council tax and regardless

454
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
of the verdict, you have to pay the court for its time and I was seeing all these numbers

455
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:43,160
and things and I was freaking out and I was scared out of my mind, but I ignored it because

456
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
I didn't know what to do and I didn't.

457
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
That's the right attitude.

458
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I ignored it because I didn't know what to do, but I went to the university and said,

459
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
how do I fix this?

460
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
And I said, just send another form.

461
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I sent another form and then I got another court issue notice saying you still haven't

462
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
appeared at court.

463
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
You have to appear.

464
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
There's another court date and now you owe us like a hundred something pounds.

465
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,160
And I was like, okay, this is not going away in the way that it should.

466
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I don't know what to do, so I did ignore it and it just went away because the more I thought

467
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:23,160
about it, it's like the only way that well, it's that they have no power to really enforce

468
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
menial matters like this.

469
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Like one guy is not paying his taxes.

470
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,160
They're not really going to have the manpower to send somebody around to make sure that

471
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
he pays it by roughing him up or something.

472
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I don't know about that shit.

473
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,160
I had a similar experience to HIPAA actually.

474
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Well, nobody came and nobody like it's still be like a warrant for you.

475
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I mean, I don't know.

476
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Knock on the door in the middle of next week's PCP.

477
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Yeah.

478
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Here's what I would do.

479
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
I would call these people and be like, hey, just want to let you know.

480
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I did.

481
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I wanted to resolve this.

482
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I tried to call them and they said, well, you should have had a thing from the university

483
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
and sent it.

484
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I said I did send it.

485
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I never got like a confirmation that it was resolved, but the letter stopped coming.

486
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
So I assumed it was resolved.

487
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm not saying like I ignored it completely.

488
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,160
It's just that the whole like you have to pay the money.

489
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
You have to do this stuff.

490
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,160
It's a lot of the time, you know, at least in the UK, it's fear mongering, especially

491
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
for like students who don't know what they're doing.

492
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Like they don't have the resources to actually make you follow all these stupid laws.

493
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Like TV license, right?

494
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:42,160
There's a TV license thing that says to watch TV, you need a license.

495
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
And that's what they say.

496
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,160
But the only thing enforcing it is not the government.

497
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
It's the BBC.

498
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,160
They would, you know, pay for people to come around and say, knock on people's doors and

499
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
say, you need to buy a TV license.

500
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Otherwise you're breaking the law, which there isn't of a law.

501
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
There isn't a law of it.

502
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,160
But people get scared into thinking they should.

503
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
And so they do.

504
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,160
And that's how they make the money.

505
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Yeah, like, and it was really annoying because the person who opened the door while I was

506
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
at uni was somebody who got scared into the thing.

507
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I mean, I didn't know at the time, but like my brother has since told me like people do

508
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,160
that and he just refused to say anything at the door and he closed the door on them and

509
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
there's nothing they can really do about it.

510
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Well, okay, I hear you on this game.

511
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I understand what you're saying.

512
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Here's where we disagree in our approach to this stuff.

513
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Like when you like go about like life this way about like trying to like just kind of

514
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,160
duck things that people expect of you, you know, warranted or not, there will like as

515
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,160
long as that's an outstanding thing, there will be like a cloud of fear like over the

516
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,160
whole thing of like, oh, someone might expect something from me.

517
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Like, I hate having that over me.

518
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I would rather just do whatever it takes to resolve it.

519
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Can I just say something about the TV license because fucking if you own a TV, you have to

520
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,160
you have to pay the TV license or at least, you know, they're going to make you because

521
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
like my dad, he doesn't speak English.

522
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
He doesn't see he doesn't watch English TV.

523
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,160
He just owns the TV and he owns the satellite to watch with Indian TV and he still has to pay

524
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,160
the fucking BBC for the channels that he's not going to ever watch ever.

525
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
He doesn't even have the cable or whatever for the.

526
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Well, I mean, what are we doing right now?

527
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,160
We're just complaining about the system that is like, I'm sorry.

528
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
The system isn't perfect.

529
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
But what are you going to do?

530
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Just like sit around playing about it and change it.

531
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Here's the thing.

532
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
All right.

533
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
You don't have to pay a TV license and there's no problem.

534
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,160
The only reason there's a thing is that the BBC doesn't run ads on their shows and they

535
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,160
expect people to watch the BBC.

536
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,160
And if you're watching the BBC, you are morally obligated to, you know, pay for the privilege of having it without ads.

537
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
But see, even if I lived in the UK, I don't use a TV.

538
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I just use the internet.

539
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
So that wouldn't even be a factor.

540
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Exactly.

541
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Which is the case for me.

542
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,160
So like when the TV license comes around, I don't need to pay it.

543
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm not going to watch BBC.

544
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Right.

545
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,160
And I'm just going to pay the internet companies to get stuff on the internet.

546
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,160
And they don't give you the thing until you're paying.

547
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,160
So it's like, that's very clearly a transaction.

548
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
The BBC is free.

549
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
It's just that they, you know...

550
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,160
They've got the Gestapo, the cut marches around.

551
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,160
They've got like the idea that you have to pay for a TV license in the public consciousness.

552
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
And now it's a thing.

553
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,160
That just seems like a terrible system on the BBC side.

554
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
It's fucked up.

555
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Yeah.

556
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Yeah.

557
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Why didn't he complain about it if he doesn't like it?

558
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Well, I was specifically responding to Maeja's point with that.

559
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Of like, I mean, I don't know, if you don't use the...

560
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Whatever.

561
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I can't even remember what it was.

562
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm pointing out that it's nonsense.

563
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,160
I don't mind paying for things that I use or do or whatever.

564
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,160
But like, we're not using the thing and we have to pay for it.

565
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
That's nonsense.

566
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I guess the general idea of like government is charging you with taxes on all these things

567
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
that you're not necessarily using.

568
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,160
And I understand that it, you know, it's one of those, as the Hello Internet podcast would put it,

569
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,160
one of the necessary lies for society.

570
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:25,160
If there weren't taxes where you had to pay for, you know, government created infrastructure,

571
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,160
then they would crumble and people would not really do anything about it.

572
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,160
But you can start like a new society in which that isn't the case.

573
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
But like, you can't really change how it is.

574
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
How did you...

575
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, I mean, I think taxes are pretty...

576
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
What do they call it?

577
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,160
They call it like the object poverty of the common space.

578
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
There's like a phrase for that.

579
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Like, when there's a public utility, nobody gives a shit about it.

580
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
And it like goes to hell, whatever it is.

581
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
It's like, it's one of those things.

582
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I don't have like a way to say this, this like smart and like a soapbox sort of moment.

583
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,160
But I just think the government and like the things they try to get out of you,

584
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,160
you live your life thinking that that is an authority and that's an absolute authority.

585
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,160
But it is in the end just a bunch of people trying to get by doing their job

586
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
of enforcing stuff that they didn't invent.

587
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
And it's all sort of like nobody really knows anything that's happening.

588
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:31,160
That's why politicians are so, you know, so disconnected because they don't...

589
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,160
They just fuck the government guys, burn it all down.

590
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,160
That's my political agenda now.

591
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm no lover of big government.

592
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I don't know.

593
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Yeah, I mean, your point seemed reasonable there.

594
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I disagree about all these things being dumb.

595
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,160
I guess it's just like I said before, I just...

596
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll adapt to whatever systems around me and then, you know, you can try to change it too, of course.

597
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I guess I'm just saying I used to think that like the idea of like people living off, you know,

598
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,160
from their own merit, living off the land and doing things by in like as small as group as possible

599
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,160
was like backwards thinking and stupid and you shouldn't even think about that.

600
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,160
And now I understand it a lot more just through having lived through some bullshit from the government

601
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,160
and seeing how it just doesn't really work for everybody in the same way.

602
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
I hear you on that.

603
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,160
I just wonder if there is in fact any going back for society.

604
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,160
You can be Amish, Amish or something.

605
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah, but that's like...

606
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,160
To me like that, I don't want to give up like technological advancement the way the Amish rejected.

607
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,160
My thing is that like I like how far we've gone and there are problems with where we are right now.

608
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I don't want to solve them by going back.

609
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I want to solve them by going further forward.

610
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Yes, indeed. Exactly.

611
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
That's what we talked about.

612
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Remember when I talked about that ASMR video that that guy made about like how society is cancer or whatever?

613
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Pretty much the same thing.

614
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,160
It was just like he was just like, oh, I want to go back to when we lived in tribes.

615
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm going to go live in the woods and it'll be great.

616
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
This isn't my fair and balanced voice.

617
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm giving this person equal weight as my own opinion.

618
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Exactly.

619
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:17,160
It's not that like literally anti-government is going back to the past to play the shitty games and suck ass.

620
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:24,160
It's that I used to think it was, but now I understand that it's more nuanced and more sensible than that.

621
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Like there are people who can live by their own means outside of the systems of government.

622
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,160
They just ignore them and they don't really do anything bad and they're just happier.

623
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I mean, that's totally within your prerogative and I feel it should be.

624
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,160
I think there's a lot of like things in place to like prevent people from circumventing the system.

625
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
And I don't think there should be.

626
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I think it should be if you want to fucking just skedaddle and go live off the grid and just be a fucking weirdo.

627
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,160
And like you're chill, but just like cutting wood and hunting for food and like living in a cave.

628
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
You're on the government's land still.

629
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
That was a cool thing.

630
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,160
My brother was like researching this because he's kind of, he's on this sort of like anti-government, like living...

631
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Terrorist campaign.

632
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
...wherever you like sort of like...

633
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,160
He's being a radicalized sloth right now.

634
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,160
He's going, you know, he's thinking about like he's doing the volunteer thing.

635
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,160
He's thinking of just volunteering on a farm for a month or something.

636
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,160
It sounds weird, but it is kind of cool because there's nothing really bad about it for him.

637
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:36,160
He explained to me that there's this weird law where if you live in a place on a piece of land for long enough

638
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:43,160
without getting like, you know, shooed away, you technically own it after a certain amount of time.

639
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I think you need to like build a house or like have some sort of structure and then live there for like five to ten years

640
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
and then you own that land and from then on like you can just do whatever you like.

641
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Ancient, oldie times law that never got updated that fell through the cracks.

642
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Yeah, and usually it's like people like if a farmer owns the land, they'll find you and then shoot you.

643
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Get out of my land, like you're not allowed.

644
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,160
But you know, that's how...

645
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,160
That's just a funny little quirk that you can exploit if you put in the time and effort.

646
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
To claim some land first on.

647
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
I mean, he's talked about it.

648
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I don't know how...

649
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
It's so sick.

650
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
But it is a sick idea.

651
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
I want this to be a real thing.

652
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
I'm rooting for him 100%.

653
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I totally get...

654
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Well, that's what I was going to say.

655
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I totally get people's desire for a simpler form of life.

656
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
But here's my real question.

657
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,160
How does this lifestyle get us closer to Starfleet?

658
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
No one fucking cares.

659
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,160
No, everyone should care if you don't reevaluate your priorities.

660
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
This is your priorities in life.

661
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
The last thing you're thinking about is Starfleet.

662
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Okay, forget Starfleet.

663
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Okay, here's the thing. Here's my actual objection.

664
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
This is fucking selfish.

665
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
This is selfish. You just want to be happy.

666
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,160
I just want to go live in the woods and be a happy little sprite.

667
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
That sounds shitty and lame and boring.

668
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I hear you, Nate.

669
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I hear you because I don't disagree.

670
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,160
If everybody did that, society would collapse and we'd get nothing done.

671
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Indeed.

672
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
For the very few...

673
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,160
You need to be exceptionally passionate for this particular thing

674
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
in order to go through with it.

675
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
There's only so many people.

676
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You need to be extremely driven.

677
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I feel like people who want to do that so much that they actually try

678
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,160
would not be able to function in the society

679
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,160
to add towards Starfleet in the way that you would want them to.

680
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,160
They would just be depressed and probably kill themselves.

681
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
If that person wasn't able to...

682
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,160
If they're that passionate about it, I want to go off the grid

683
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
and just live off the land.

684
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
That's what really intrigues me.

685
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
They're so against the paradigm that we're currently kind of...

686
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
to direct people going towards it.

687
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,160
You could even argue that they are just like a drain on society

688
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
by not being depressed, taking medication and killing themselves.

689
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
And be fucking not helpful.

690
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
That's what your brother is.

691
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm just saying in general.

692
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Everyone can contribute to my glorious future.

693
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
But I have no interest in telling people...

694
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I have no desire to tell people what they can and can't do.

695
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
But what I want to do is...

696
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
No, no, no.

697
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I don't want to enforce any kind of laws enforcement.

698
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,160
What I want to do is socially shame them into contributing

699
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,160
in a vociferous way as is appropriate.

700
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,160
I feel like there's enough social shame to make people feel like

701
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
they have to fit in and do everything else.

702
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Everything that everyone else is doing.

703
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Shame is just the societal shit test.

704
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,160
There's enough pressure as it is already on people to fit in

705
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
and do something with their lives.

706
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I don't care about fitting in.

707
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Be productive.

708
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Exactly. I'm talking about being productive.

709
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,160
There's enough social pressure on people to be productive

710
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,160
and people who are not being productive with their lives

711
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,160
just feel this pressure and shame for not being productive

712
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,160
and some of them get depressed and even kill themselves

713
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,160
because they feel like they're being a waste and that's terrible.

714
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I fully encourage those people to do whatever they need to do

715
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
to feel better and have a decent life.

716
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,160
But if they come asking me for a dollar, the answer's no.

717
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
They have to fucking run their own shit.

718
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,160
I mean, on the one hand, begging, I don't really care for.

719
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,160
At some point, you can't do anything but beg

720
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
and that's really unfortunate.

721
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I pass two or three beggars whenever I go to the marketplace

722
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
and looking at you.

723
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
I'm not saying that I have no sympathy or that I would never help

724
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
like people who are truly impoverished

725
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
and can't get out of whatever death spiral they're in.

726
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,160
I mean kind of in a larger societal way.

727
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,160
There's definitely a type of person who has this crazy ideal

728
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
but doesn't have the passion to do it themselves

729
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,160
or the drive to actually get it done.

730
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,160
They will just leech off of others until...

731
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
That's what I don't like.

732
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Nate, there's no way I can phrase this question in a non-confrontational way

733
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
but I do not mean a confrontational way.

734
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Okay, what are you doing to make Starfleet real?

735
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Okay, I think about that question a lot.

736
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I've thought about my deep shame

737
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
at the fact that I am not a scientist

738
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,160
trying to pursue scientific truth

739
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,160
that will enable us to create things that will allow us to be.

740
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Here's what I'm doing. This is what I tell myself at night

741
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
and I think it's a reasonable answer.

742
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,160
What I'm doing is I'm trying to encourage people

743
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
through my YouTube stuff.

744
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
My day job is basically just so that I'll survive.

745
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
It's a job that's fine.

746
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
It's part of the military industrial complex a little bit.

747
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,160
So that's kind of not great, but whatever.

748
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm doing it just to survive.

749
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,160
But my YouTube stuff, I am talking about things

750
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,160
and specifically I pull out ideas from shows

751
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,160
and I repackage them in ways that I find are valuable.

752
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
They're like little morals.

753
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I think that if people listen to my point to them,

754
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,160
they will better contribute to a positive future.

755
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
For example, here's one.

756
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,160
He said that not every game needs a fucking easy mode.

757
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,160
I didn't think about why I'm right about game difficulty.

758
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,160
The real point of that is we do not need society

759
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
to just bend over backwards to allow every single person

760
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,160
to be able to participate in every single activity.

761
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm sorry that the guy without arms can't play Dark Souls,

762
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
but maybe he'll figure out how to play with his face

763
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
and be all the better for it.

764
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,160
We need to neuter a video game so that someone could

765
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,160
completely change it so that every single person

766
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
is able to get through the whole thing

767
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
and experience every single kind of content.

768
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,160
The point of that statement is I'm encouraging people

769
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
to rise up and achieve things on their own

770
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,160
as opposed to expect everyone else to lower things down

771
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
to the standards that these people are demanding.

772
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
And I think through those kinds of messaging,

773
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,160
which I would argue is the fundamental core

774
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
of my content online,

775
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,160
is better themselves, which I feel is the way

776
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
that humanity as a whole makes progress

777
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
towards things like Starfleet.

778
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
That's what I tell myself at night,

779
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
and I think it's kind of okay.

780
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
It comforts me somewhat.

781
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
It's very easy to laugh at something like that

782
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
and say, oh, you're just making content,

783
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,160
you fucking fool, but I do see that you are

784
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,160
making videos because you have something about,

785
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
you have a very clear world view,

786
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,160
and you bring it, you don't say,

787
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
you don't make videos just to make videos

788
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
about X anime or X video game like some people do.

789
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,160
You always take points from media

790
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,160
because people like reviews of things,

791
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
and it's a good way to get the message across.

792
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
So I see that.

793
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
And I'm not saying that's 100% of everything I do,

794
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
but that's an element there

795
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
that I think is a pretty strong one.

796
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
So yeah, that's me.

797
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,160
It's part of why I've had trouble with Hippocrite

798
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
is that I don't have a world view message

799
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
that I want to push,

800
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,160
and so a lot of it, initially, it was like,

801
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I like these video games.

802
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm gonna explain why I like them,

803
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
and it worked for a bit,

804
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
but now I don't really care about explaining

805
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
why these old video games are good,

806
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
and I don't really know why.

807
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I mean, when I think about the success

808
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
of AVGN or whatever,

809
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I think, because nobody really cared about

810
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
the video games until he played it,

811
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,160
it's specifically the character of him

812
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
and what he brought to it, you know?

813
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
That was the X-Factor.

814
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,160
People like AVGN, they always have the drive.

815
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Well, he specifically has a drive over.

816
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
He loves making movies,

817
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
and he's made movies all his life.

818
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
So AVGN is a character he plays,

819
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
and it's a movie.

820
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
It's a short film that he's making every time.

821
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
It's not a review.

822
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
It's always about how this comedy character

823
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
can make people laugh.

824
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,160
And with Hippocrite,

825
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,160
I don't have a core thing,

826
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
and that's why I haven't been...

827
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
John Tron, too, doesn't have a core thing.

828
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
He used to have a few games

829
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,160
that like Banjo-Kazooie and Star Fox and stuff.

830
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
He ran out of that narrative.

831
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,160
He ran out of games from his childhood

832
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
that he really wanted to talk about

833
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
and explain why this was a bad thing

834
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
or why this game sequel sucks

835
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
and Rare was great and now they suck,

836
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
and it's so bad.

837
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I love this game, guys.

838
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,160
John has pitted out because he's stopped...

839
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,160
He's ran out of things from that part of his life,

840
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,160
and now he has to think of just things to make jokes about,

841
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
and it clearly shows that it's not as interesting to him

842
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,160
as it is as his older content,

843
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
and that's why he's slowed down so much.

844
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
That's why I've slowed down so much.

845
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
That's why a lot of people slow down, I think,

846
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,160
is because they don't have a core reason

847
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
for making the videos that they have made for a bit.

848
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
You know, this reminds me of just the...

849
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
There's a phenomenon people are talking about

850
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
more of, like, YouTuber burnout,

851
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
and I think it really is something like this.

852
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
It's like so many people, like, telling stories

853
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
about their life or talking about, like,

854
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
things that have interested them,

855
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
either, like, I don't know, like, there's people like...

856
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
You know that Michelle Fawn was, like,

857
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
the makeup queen of YouTube,

858
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
but she, like, got bored with it,

859
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
like, stopped her channel and now, like, is an animator

860
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
and just, like, wants to be...

861
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Like, she's got, like, millions of fucking subscribers

862
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
on her main channel.

863
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
She had, like, 10 million or something,

864
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
but she completely abandoned it

865
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
because she, like, ran out of juice.

866
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
I mean, this was years and years ago at this point

867
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
and just, like, wants to be, like, a YouTube animator

868
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
or something now, which is pretty fucking dope.

869
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
That's the problem with YouTube, right?

870
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Yeah.

871
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
I don't even say it's a problem.

872
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
It's just like...

873
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,160
It's a problem that everybody who's creating

874
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
on the platform has to kind of try and reconcile

875
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
is that YouTube is a show that never ends.

876
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Yeah, well, what do you think about this?

877
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Let me throw this at you.

878
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I've been thinking...

879
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
I've been cooking up kind of my thoughts on this subject

880
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
and here's what I've come up with.

881
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Like, being a YouTuber is basically offering up, like,

882
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
yourself as a service.

883
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
I've said that many times.

884
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,160
But, like, what do you really have to offer?

885
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Like, your life experiences, your opinions on things.

886
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
And here's my question.

887
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,160
Like, if you've just lived a life as a YouTuber

888
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
and you have no particular expertise,

889
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,160
you're just relaying, like, your...

890
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
however you lived your life.

891
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Let's say you're, like, a Logan Paul type guy.

892
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Like, you're an entertainer.

893
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,160
You're, like, a hype machine kind of guy.

894
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
But there's not much substance beneath it.

895
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm not even trying to insult the guy.

896
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
It's just like he's not, like, a physicist

897
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
who has extensive knowledge about something

898
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,160
and can, like, make interesting physics-related content

899
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
or something.

900
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,160
And I'm wondering if, like, where does that road end?

901
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,160
How much can you really mine from that kind of world experience

902
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,160
as opposed to, I mean, just as one example,

903
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,160
like, Jordan Peterson will, like, be able to talk forever

904
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,160
on his YouTube channel, which is quite successful,

905
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,160
because he has spent, like, 30 or 40 years

906
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
as a clinical psychologist and has, like,

907
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
an endless reservoir of experience to draw from.

908
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
And I feel like, like, him?

909
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,160
He's not gonna get, like, burnt out as a YouTuber

910
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
just from having to make content day after day.

911
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
There's two different audiences for that, though.

912
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Like, because if you gotta remember that, like,

913
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,160
at the end of the day, like, all of humanity's on, like,

914
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
a life cycle, right?

915
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Like, you're always gonna have new little kids

916
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
who don't want any, like, depth to their content

917
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
and just laugh at the meme jokes.

918
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,160
And there'll always be a Logan Paul to serve those young kids.

919
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
And then as they get older, they want something with more substance

920
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
as they start to develop their own worldviews.

921
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
And that's where you get people like Jordan Peterson

922
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
who are talking about more bigger, headier ideas

923
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
that you need to sit down and kind of decompress

924
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
and, like, unpack in your own brain.

925
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,160
I guess I just think that, I wonder if it's just, like,

926
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
that kind of content, like, Logan Paul makes or whatever,

927
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,160
is just inevitably not going to be kind of sustainable long-term.

928
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,160
But then again, I mean, maybe he'll just pivot into, like, being an actor.

929
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,160
But, you know, just because one person at the very tip-top,

930
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,160
like, makes it, doesn't mean that, like, the whole trend is sustainable.

931
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
I don't know. I don't know. Just, uh...

932
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,160
My biggest thing with YouTube is that I think it's interesting

933
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,160
how, like, it's shaped the way content is kind of served to people

934
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
and what people expect, right?

935
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, yeah.

936
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Like, you can't...

937
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Like, it's interesting because now that I'm...

938
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
because I don't really do YouTube anymore

939
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,160
and that was, like, the reason why I stopped putting so much effort in it

940
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,160
is, like, I don't want to make a show that never ends.

941
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Like, I want to make a product that deliver it

942
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,160
and then move on to the next product.

943
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Sure.

944
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
It's understandable.

945
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
It's, like, that doesn't fit in the paradigm.

946
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Like, if I started a YouTube channel right now

947
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
and said, oh, I'm going to, like, document my game development stuff,

948
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
like, eventually the game will be finished

949
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
and then the show will be over.

950
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,160
You end up in, like, a Yandere Dev situation

951
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
where I think that guy's milking it.

952
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
There's a whole clock...

953
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah, there's a whole thing about that guy.

954
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
There's a whole other topic.

955
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
But it's just, it's like, you...

956
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,160
if you get into YouTube and you start picking up the traffic,

957
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,160
like, you can't ever stop, you know,

958
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,160
because there's no, like, end state on YouTube.

959
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,160
It's either you're continuing to make things at least weekly

960
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
or you're dead.

961
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Well, you say you can't stop.

962
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Do you mean that you can't stop

963
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
without, like, tanking your progress

964
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
in this particular career field?

965
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Right.

966
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Yeah, okay, okay.

967
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
I hear you.

968
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
And you can't just...

969
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
It has to keep going.

970
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
It has to keep perpetuating

971
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,160
because that's how the whole YouTube system is set up.

972
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Yeah.

973
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
You know?

974
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Like, you can't...

975
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
It's because if you are a filmmaker or something

976
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
and you are promoting things on YouTube

977
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
and, like, oh, I'm making this movie,

978
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
it's a fucking crazy movie

979
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
and everyone's really invested in that movie

980
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
and then you make the movie,

981
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,160
like, you've done your job, right?

982
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Like, your goal was accomplished

983
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
of making the movie,

984
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
but all those hundreds of thousands of people

985
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
who are following you,

986
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
they're like, okay, when's the next movie?

987
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,160
And it's like, I will.

988
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,160
And this is, like, New Game Plus, bitch, go.

989
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,160
And it's just like, no, I don't really want to.

990
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
So it's like, you have this whole...

991
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,160
And, like, all the things you've built up now are gone

992
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,160
unless you find a way to keep perpetuating somehow.

993
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
I mean, there's ways.

994
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,160
It's really just a...

995
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
I can't think of the word.

996
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
A thing of variety

997
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,160
and, like, having a lot of different...

998
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,160
You know, I can't think of the words.

999
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,160
I can't think of any of these words I'm trying to say.

1000
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,160
I missed that segment, dude.

1001
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,160
I need more episodes if I can't think of a word.

1002
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Neil Cicerega has, you know,

1003
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,160
he has fingers in a little different pies.

1004
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
I think that's an expression.

1005
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
He has his YouTube thing.

1006
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,160
He has his guaranteed video series

1007
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,160
on Patreon thing.

1008
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,160
But they're, you know, they're very wildly

1009
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
in, like, podcasts and skits

1010
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,160
and he's had so many different, like, just things

1011
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,160
that he, you know, he's got those funny albums,

1012
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,160
mash-up albums with the smash-mouth things.

1013
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
And he's just, like, really good

1014
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,160
at a lot of different things

1015
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
and people love him for lots of different things

1016
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,160
they didn't even realize that he was the one who made them.

1017
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,160
And I think as long as you have, like, things,

1018
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,160
like, creative things

1019
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,160
and you don't care where they go, necessarily,

1020
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
like, if you have, like, a creative idea

1021
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
but it won't work for the YouTube series

1022
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
you're currently making,

1023
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
then just make it anyway

1024
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,160
because it's something you want to do.

1025
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,160
And then if it's good, people will like it

1026
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
and then you'll, you know,

1027
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,160
people will associate your name with a thing

1028
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,160
that is, you know, not necessarily one thing,

1029
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,160
but like a person who can make lots of cool things.

1030
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
I think there's...

1031
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
Yeah, go on, Tim.

1032
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,160
I was just gonna say, I think it's the interesting strategy

1033
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
that seems to be, like, the most effective

1034
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
for fitting in this paradigm

1035
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
is something that none of us really do.

1036
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
I guess maybe Digi kind of does it,

1037
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,160
is that you make a brand based around you as a person

1038
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
and everything else is just kind of a subsidiary of that.

1039
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
Yeah, yeah.

1040
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,160
Because then, like, as long as you're not dead,

1041
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
like, your story's still going on.

1042
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,160
And so if you can sell people on who you are

1043
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,160
and they are interested in who you are,

1044
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
no matter what you decide to do

1045
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,160
or what projects you decide to work on,

1046
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,160
the true line is that it's you that's doing it.

1047
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,160
I mean, I would agree with that, except for the fact that

1048
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,160
the majority of the people who watched Digi

1049
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,160
watched Digi because he does good analysis of anime specifically.

1050
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,160
And if he completely stops doing that,

1051
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
and he became like, if he became like,

1052
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
well, yeah, I guess,

1053
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,160
but like if he became like a full-time rapper,

1054
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,160
he wouldn't be as successful.

1055
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,160
But it would still be, you know, alright,

1056
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
because he's proven himself a couple of times.

1057
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
I don't think he's doing it perfectly.

1058
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,160
I don't think anybody that we know is doing it perfectly.

1059
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,160
But there are clearly channels that exist,

1060
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,160
like vloggers and stuff on YouTube who have tons of success,

1061
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
that just do whatever.

1062
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,160
And you care because the point is that it's them doing whatever.

1063
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,160
It's not that they've developed a channel around a certain topic.

1064
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,160
The topic is, this is my life.

1065
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Yeah, but that inherently, like we were saying earlier,

1066
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
will lead to burnout.

1067
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Like Game Grumps, Game Grumps have been doing,

1068
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,160
you know, Aaron especially has been doing it the entire time,

1069
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,160
has like, they've run out of stories to tell about their life.

1070
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,160
The only thing they can talk about is the things that are currently happening

1071
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,160
outside of Game Grumps.

1072
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,160
And it's usually just banned promotion stuff or, you know,

1073
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,160
they met a guy or, you know, there's less about their life.

1074
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,160
They met a handsome lady and they've got lots of stories to tell.

1075
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Well, that's the thing, that's what I'm saying.

1076
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Like you have to make your brand basically about what you're doing in the moment.

1077
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Because then that's always...

1078
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
I feel like that, I mean...

1079
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,160
You know what stories will never run out depending on the person?

1080
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
What?

1081
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Dreams.

1082
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Oh God, oh...

1083
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,160
Sorry, I had to say that too.

1084
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Did I tell you guys about a Game Grumps episode that I watched recently?

1085
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,160
And I watched, I mean, watched the first half and I was like,

1086
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,160
oh my God, and then I was like, but I don't care, and then I stopped.

1087
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
You don't think so?

1088
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,160
What was it?

1089
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,160
There is a series on Game Grumps about Aaron Hanson Wikipediaing himself.

1090
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Oh, I watched some of those.

1091
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,160
And in part two, he just blatantly and openly and like,

1092
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,160
honestly talks about the genre, just like,

1093
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,160
just like, nonchalantly and not weirdly.

1094
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Like it's not like a big deal, he just talks about it as if it were just,

1095
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
you know, common, common knowledge.

1096
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
What did he, what did he say?

1097
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
He didn't say anything particularly insightful.

1098
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
It's not like he, he doesn't explain it in any way.

1099
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Did Danny fuck...

1100
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
Fuck Susie, yes.

1101
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,160
Susie, I mean, John, whatever, yeah, okay.

1102
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Did Danny fuck John?

1103
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
He did.

1104
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
And that's how it went right away.

1105
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,160
I mean, he didn't talk about it, like he, he talked about it in reference to

1106
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,160
Did You Know Game, you know, whatever, I don't care.

1107
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,160
But the fact that he did that at all was extremely surprising to me.

1108
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,160
And I want to know, anyone who watches Game Grumps Drift,

1109
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,160
that's any, any percent of the population.

1110
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,160
And by that, I mean, any of you four and point seven million people who might be watching,

1111
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,160
what is happening?

1112
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Is this, has there been like a, like some video, some monumental video

1113
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,160
that just has explained everything?

1114
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Is that what's happening right now?

1115
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
You know, have we stumbled upon that?

1116
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,160
I'm pretty sure that did not happen.

1117
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,160
And now that I think about it, there was like three parts to that Wikipedia thing.

1118
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,160
I'm pretty sure I watched all of parts one and two.

1119
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
And he's just kind of, like, I don't know.

1120
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,160
It's kind of strange that he, well, what isn't strange is the way he talked about in that video.

1121
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
He was just very nonchalant, like you said.

1122
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
He was like, yeah, I mean, I worked with these guys.

1123
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,160
These guys, oh yeah, we've, John, we broke up with them with the fucking Game Grumps stuff.

1124
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
And, you know, we'd already been hanging out with Dan a lot.

1125
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,160
And I'd been saying, like, if John ever left, you know, Danny would like take his place.

1126
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
So this was kind of in the works already.

1127
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,160
And I was just like, oh, well, why wasn't any of this clarified in the past?

1128
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,160
Maybe it was just something as simple as he didn't feel like talking about it

1129
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,160
and didn't think it would like be a big deal.

1130
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,160
I could imagine he could tell it was, I could imagine he knew it would be a big deal.

1131
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,160
He just didn't want to talk about it.

1132
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,160
I always wonder about this.

1133
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,160
When there's a, when a drama shit storm happens, like the world can go a flutter.

1134
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Like tons of people will be talking about it.

1135
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:09,160
But the people or person at the center of it, like they have only one person's perspective

1136
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,160
as to what the whole drama situation like would be.

1137
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,160
Whatever it may be, maybe it's Aaron, maybe it's John, whoever.

1138
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,160
Like, maybe things don't look that bad from their perspective.

1139
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,160
And like, even if the whole world is up in arms, like, gasping or whatever,

1140
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,160
if this person only hears from like a handful of people specifically

1141
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,160
and like doesn't go to seek out drama about it,

1142
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,160
probably just doesn't seem like a big deal.

1143
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,160
And maybe that's what happened with Aaron and like the whole John drama.

1144
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,160
I mean, it doesn't even seem like, like it would be difficult to imagine that John,

1145
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,160
like John already had a lot of reasons to want to go to New York.

1146
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
And then he eventually had a girlfriend there.

1147
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,160
So like the idea that John would eventually leave to work more on John Tron

1148
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,160
is like maybe they were already talking about that.

1149
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
I mean, these are the things that Aaron said at the time too.

1150
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,160
Like just John went to go work.

1151
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,160
So I mean, he may have just been 100% clear from the start.

1152
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,160
I never really thought that there was like a big like argument

1153
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
or like a big like scandalous event.

1154
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,160
I really just thought it was sad and I wanted to know why they didn't,

1155
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,160
they weren't friends anymore, seemingly.

1156
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:19,160
But then Stargate happened and it was all okay, hopefully, kind of.

1157
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,160
I thought it was interesting that he, that that happened.

1158
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
And that's what I wanted to say about that.

1159
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
But I don't care about that.

1160
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,160
And what I do care about is going back to what Hippo said, except not at all,

1161
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,160
because I don't care about what he said.

1162
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
I care about what I thought he was going to say,

1163
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,160
which is the following about the government.

1164
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,160
The government is worse than ghost.

1165
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,160
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

1166
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Specifically last night, I was walking past a abandoned government,

1167
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,160
like military, government military base in a town I was visiting last night.

1168
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,160
I was visiting my covens in an impoverished California, like desert-y type area.

1169
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Super scary.

1170
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Late at night, walking past like government, like a medical center,

1171
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
like an abandoned government military center.

1172
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,160
Terrifying.

1173
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,160
And the government is worse than ghost, because ghosts are real, of course.

1174
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,160
But the government, like you need to be able to prove ghosts are doing something, obviously,

1175
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,160
but you can do that very easily, very easily.

1176
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,160
But the government, you can tell me the government is doing literally anything

1177
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
and I will believe you.

1178
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,160
The government, like from a young age, watching Game Theory not a joke,

1179
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Game Theory revealed me what MK Ultra was.

1180
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,160
And ever since I knew what MK Ultra was, thanks to game, this is not a joke.

1181
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,160
Watch the fucking The Polybius, the Polybius episode.

1182
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,160
I watched Game Theory as a lot as a kid.

1183
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,160
Ever since that moment, I've never trusted the government, ever.

1184
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,160
And I can never trust the government.

1185
00:55:52,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I don't know how anyone can, like, vote or participate in the government in any way,

1186
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,160
knowing that nothing is real.

1187
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:08,160
Like, I cannot believe anything that the government, any, like a politician,

1188
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,160
like a government worker, like a post office worker, nothing.

1189
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
I can believe nothing anyone is saying.

1190
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,160
You might be getting MK Ultra'd right now without even knowing about it.

1191
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Yeah, exactly.

1192
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Exactly.

1193
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,160
I could be in a, like, drug and do a stupor right now.

1194
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
That's not a joke.

1195
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,160
This is not, like, me trying to be funny.

1196
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Yeah, it's possible.

1197
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Like, oh, like, what if it's happening?

1198
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
It is happening.

1199
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,160
All conspiracy theories have basically all happened.

1200
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:37,160
They've all, like, like, you know, they've put HIV into a black community to watch how it progresses.

1201
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,160
MK Ultra, oh, it's just real.

1202
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,160
It's not like, you know, what if, it is real.

1203
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,160
So how do I know I don't have HIV right now?

1204
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,160
Well, you could go to the doctor.

1205
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,160
No!

1206
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
The government!

1207
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,160
The doctors are bought off by the government, too!

1208
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,160
You think the MDs don't know about what's going on?

1209
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,160
They are the ones who have manufactured it.

1210
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,160
Well, you'll find out if you have HIV sooner or later.

1211
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
What?

1212
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
It's going to happen to all of us.

1213
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,160
HIV minefields are going to be your future.

1214
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,160
You guys aren't taking this seriously.

1215
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,160
The government, like, can do anything, and they can give me HIV.

1216
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Okay, all right.

1217
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,160
Listen, when conspiracy theorists always go crazy

1218
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,160
and assume the government is way better at stuff than it actually is,

1219
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,160
that's what I think.

1220
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,160
Why do you think-

1221
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Okay, listen, listen.

1222
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
My opinion is this.

1223
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Give it one ruse by the government that could not obliterate-

1224
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
Okay.

1225
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
Munchie.

1226
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Munchie could not kill me.

1227
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,160
They could.

1228
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,160
Cover it up excellently.

1229
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Have no one remember who I was.

1230
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
Give me one reason why they can't.

1231
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Munchie, munchie, munchie.

1232
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,160
Okay, like, let's say they could.

1233
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,160
Let's say they could do all the things you're scared of them doing it.

1234
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,160
Just because you're aware of it and are scared of it

1235
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
is not going to stop them.

1236
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,160
So what's the point of being scared of it?

1237
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,160
I mean, it's still appropriate to be scared, I suppose.

1238
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,160
Just not to obsess about it and let it fuck you up.

1239
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
I don't like obsess about it.

1240
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
I think that the government-

1241
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
I just don't trust the government now.

1242
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,160
The reason I don't think the government would do anything like that

1243
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,160
is not to say they wouldn't have a reason to kill Munchie.

1244
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,160
Which they have many, of course.

1245
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,160
The reason it would be difficult for them

1246
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,160
is because everything's run by money

1247
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,160
and doing good things really well

1248
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
requires a lot of money

1249
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,160
and they would need a lot of money to try and-

1250
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,160
If they have an enemy number one

1251
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,160
they're not going to make a real return on investment

1252
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,160
going out all out with 100 billion spies

1253
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160
with gas weapons and stuff.

1254
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,160
It's going to cost a lot to get rid of just one secret guy.

1255
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,160
I mean, what was that Snowden guy?

1256
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
He's alive, right? He's in Russia.

1257
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,160
They haven't even managed to assassinate him.

1258
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,160
That is true.

1259
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,160
I'm not saying that I am going to be assassinated

1260
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,160
or that there's any reason to kill me, murder me.

1261
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,160
But there is plenty of reason to brainwash me

1262
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,160
because I am part of the populace.

1263
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,160
Well, yeah.

1264
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,160
I think that's all of society's job.

1265
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Brainwashing is harder than you think.

1266
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,160
I think it's socially influencing.

1267
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
Everyone does it on a daily basis to everyone else.

1268
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Yeah, I basically agree with that.

1269
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
But here's why.

1270
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,160
Do I believe that there can be grassroots movements?

1271
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,160
Let's just say, for example,

1272
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,160
a government agency says we want this candidate to win

1273
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,160
so we are going to put lots of money into campaigns

1274
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,160
and support super PACs and whatnot

1275
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,160
so that they will win.

1276
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,160
Yeah, definitely possible.

1277
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,160
Hillary had so much support

1278
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,160
just from every famous person in the world to try to win.

1279
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,160
It didn't work out, which is actually quite...

1280
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,160
That really is a conspiracy buster in my mind.

1281
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
It's like, thank God,

1282
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,160
even though the entire government apparatus can conspire

1283
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,160
to put one person in office,

1284
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,160
they can still overwrite that authority

1285
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,160
and get someone like Trump.

1286
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,160
At the very least, I find that a somewhat comforting thought.

1287
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
It's also kind of scary, but whatever.

1288
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,160
I just don't think that, you know,

1289
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,160
even the most well-equipped,

1290
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,160
well-funded group of people,

1291
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
they can't really do that much

1292
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,160
because they're still just humans

1293
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,160
and humans are fucking idiots.

1294
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,160
That's fair.

1295
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,160
You really have to take these things

1296
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,160
covering up a scandal

1297
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,160
and they've done that in the past.

1298
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,160
There's probably hundreds of scandals we have no idea about

1299
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,160
and then one will leak out in a year

1300
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,160
and it will be like, oh my God, I didn't know they did that.

1301
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,160
But it won't be anything as like,

1302
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,160
unbelievably alien technology,

1303
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
like brainwashing...

1304
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,160
I'm thinking of brainwashing in the cartoon way

1305
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,160
where your eyes swirl and then you are a zombie.

1306
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,160
But like normal amounts of brainwashing,

1307
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,160
the schools, they tell you to do certain things

1308
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,160
and because they need people to be disciplined

1309
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,160
and so they can be put into jobs

1310
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,160
that are meaningless pieces of crap

1311
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,160
and they fucking want to go live in the woods

1312
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,160
and it just makes sense to go live in the woods.

1313
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,160
It makes sense.

1314
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,160
I think most of the things are privately owned by people

1315
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,160
so they catch you.

1316
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,160
All you need to do is live there secretly for 5, 10 years

1317
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,160
and you own that tree.

1318
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,160
I feel like this is completely separate from what I'm trying to say.

1319
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,160
I'm trying to say that the government is extremely powerful

1320
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
and I am an ant.

1321
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
I kind of disagree with that

1322
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,160
because I think that the government is far less powerful

1323
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
than most people think that it is.

1324
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,160
I truly believe that.

1325
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,160
It comes down to one thing.

1326
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,160
I don't mean in a little government way.

1327
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,160
The military can shoot me really hard.

1328
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,160
I find myself comforted by many thoughts

1329
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,160
on why that will probably never ever happen.

1330
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,160
A lot of them are just political ramifications

1331
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
of an actually tyrannical government.

1332
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
Here's the thing.

1333
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,160
Is it possible the CIA could say,

1334
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,160
Munchy, Nate Best Boy, Hippocrite, whoever,

1335
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,160
X person is a threat.

1336
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Let's PCP gang get him out of here.

1337
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
I don't know.

1338
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,160
George Bush wanted to leak some state secrets

1339
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
because he felt really bad about some stuff he'd done

1340
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,160
with the Iraq war or something.

1341
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,160
Is it possible that the government would say,

1342
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,160
for national security, we're going to kill him.

1343
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,160
It's the only way to keep the secrets safe

1344
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,160
and we're going to do it.

1345
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Then we find out in a week that,

1346
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,160
how weird George Bush, W,

1347
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,160
died from a heroin overdose.

1348
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Man, isn't that weird?

1349
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
They found some injections that can't be explained in his wrist.

1350
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Pretty strange. Don't know what that's about.

1351
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
Could they do that? Absolutely.

1352
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,160
I'm sure that they have in the past.

1353
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,160
But when it comes to you and I,

1354
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,160
we are not important enough

1355
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,160
to do these sorts of things too.

1356
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,160
I guess I'm kind of comforted by that,

1357
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,160
as well as two words that I'm a big believer in.

1358
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,160
I know that it can potentially make me blind

1359
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,160
to some things, but these two words,

1360
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,160
I am a strong believer in.

1361
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,160
It's Occam's razor.

1362
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,160
It's just that the simplest explanation

1363
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
is usually the correct one.

1364
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,160
In that way, a conspiracy buff

1365
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,160
like Alex Jones might be right about something

1366
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,160
every once in a grand while,

1367
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,160
but then we'll say absolutely crazy shit

1368
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,160
that is definitely not true.

1369
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,160
That which is asserted without evidence

1370
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,160
can be dismissed without evidence,

1371
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,160
to quote Christopher Hitchens.

1372
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,160
Then he'll be right about one of these random things

1373
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,160
once in a while, whereas me,

1374
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,160
I'm an incredible skeptic.

1375
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,160
I don't believe anything without evidence

1376
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
on a grand scale.

1377
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,160
I need hardcore proof that anything is true.

1378
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Even the fact that I am a human being

1379
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,160
living in this world, I have absolutely no proof

1380
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,160
that that is 100% true.

1381
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,160
I could absolutely be a brain in a vat,

1382
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,160
a program running on a computer in another universe,

1383
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,160
and this is all a simulation.

1384
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,160
100% true, so I would never assert

1385
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,160
that everything around me is real.

1386
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,160
Thinking of that sort of mentality.

1387
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,160
I sort of agree with you, there's absolutely no proof,

1388
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,160
but I think whoever is running the simulation,

1389
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
if this is a simulation,

1390
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160
they probably wouldn't want to put in other people

1391
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,160
questioning whether or not this is a simulation

1392
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,160
because then you'll start questioning

1393
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,160
if this is a simulation.

1394
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,160
What if it was a little Jesus alien

1395
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,160
and he's like, I'm going to create a universe

1396
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,160
for my science for a project,

1397
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
and I'm going to test to see

1398
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
how many people figure it out,

1399
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
and then he gets his little checkbook out

1400
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,160
and he's looking at Earth and he's like,

1401
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
okay, most people don't believe it.

1402
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,160
I've seen specifically about a simulation though.

1403
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,160
I'm using Occam's razor here as well,

1404
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,160
in the sense that I can't prove

1405
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,160
that I live in the real world,

1406
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,160
but I'm happy to just assume

1407
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,160
for the most part that this is probably real,

1408
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,160
this is probably reality,

1409
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
even though there's a couple of thought experiments

1410
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,160
that show that it's actually more likely

1411
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
we live in a simulation than not,

1412
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,160
but I won't get into all that.

1413
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,160
Yeah, whatever.

1414
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,160
I'm happy being a synthetic little man.

1415
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,160
That's the main thing.

1416
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
It doesn't impact me in any way,

1417
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,160
and I heard one time I listened to a flat Earth

1418
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,160
call into Stephen Mollinieu's show,

1419
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,160
and this was a very interesting show.

1420
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,160
So Mollinieu just puts up with this guy,

1421
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,160
talking about all his beliefs,

1422
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,160
and then Stefan is just like,

1423
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,160
okay, I have a question for you.

1424
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,160
How much benefit has come to your life

1425
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,160
through believing that the world is actually flat

1426
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,160
and that everyone is lying to you?

1427
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,160
And the guy was like, well,

1428
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,160
and he was like, and how many hours per week

1429
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,160
do you spend on this shit?

1430
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
And the guy's like, well, you know,

1431
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,160
I spend like 30 hours a week maybe,

1432
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,160
and he's like, okay, maybe your time would be better served

1433
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,160
devoting that time to improving your life,

1434
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,160
learning new skills,

1435
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,160
working more to earn more money to put away for savings.

1436
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,160
And it basically turned out that this guy

1437
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,160
was just a sad, sad man

1438
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
who had very little in his life

1439
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,160
and clung to this conspiracy theory

1440
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,160
as maybe some grand secret that like,

1441
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,160
ah, me and my elite few are privy to.

1442
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,160
So this is something I can use to give myself

1443
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,160
a substantive ego in this life,

1444
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,160
that I have this knowledge.

1445
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,160
But really, he's basically tricking and fooling himself.

1446
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,160
And I find that highly edifying

1447
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,160
when it comes to the mindset of the overly credulous.

1448
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,160
It's people who want to know things a lot of the time.

1449
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Can't that like same argument be used against somebody

1450
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,160
who's trying to push forward towards starfleet?

1451
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,160
Is that they just are a scared little boy

1452
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,160
and they watch this TV show as a kid?

1453
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
Well, but I would be happy to go into detail

1454
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
as to why, and I have on many occasions,

1455
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,160
as to specifically why I find that to be,

1456
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,160
in fact, kind of the only noble goal of humanity

1457
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,160
as opposed to believing things that, you know, aren't true

1458
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,160
or asserting that, like, just like any kind of outage.

1459
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,160
Oh, no, I'm a staunch believer

1460
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,160
in believing things that aren't true.

1461
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Well, this is a little bit of a deviation

1462
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,160
from Munchie's point, regardless.

1463
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,160
I'm so fucking distraught right now

1464
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,160
that you people don't agree with me

1465
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,160
that the United States government has funny gas

1466
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,160
and it has a Batman utility belt of people.

1467
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,160
I'm so fucking mad right now.

1468
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,160
You know, the government is fucking really fucked up, dude,

1469
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,160
and I totally agree with you.

1470
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
I was, like, on the government conspiracy train

1471
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
for a long time, and I honestly still am.

1472
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Yeah, me too.

1473
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,160
I'm a huge fucking government conspiracist,

1474
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,160
because why wouldn't I?

1475
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Because it's not because MKUltra is real.

1476
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,160
It's not like it's, oh, I believe it is.

1477
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,160
There's tons of fucking evidence on the book

1478
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,160
that these people do some fucked up shit,

1479
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
and it's totally messed up.

1480
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,160
What are we going to do as a result of MKUltra being real?

1481
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Like, what should we advocate for the government

1482
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
to be more transparent, to, like, shut down

1483
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,160
these kind of programs?

1484
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,160
I can never trust that.

1485
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,160
Even if they say that they shut them down,

1486
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,160
I will not trust them.

1487
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,160
This is not like I want change to happen.

1488
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
I'm doing this expressing the human emotion

1489
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,160
of fear that I will die

1490
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,160
at the hands of Barack Obama.

1491
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,160
You know what's all this issue, though?

1492
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Let's all advocate for tiny, small government,

1493
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,160
so that the way to get rid of MKUltra

1494
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,160
and all these other things

1495
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,160
is to slowly, democratically defund the government.

1496
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,160
So it just doesn't have the power to do this shit.

1497
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,160
That's what I said.

1498
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,160
I'm just trying to say

1499
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,160
that I agree with Munchie

1500
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,160
that the government is evil

1501
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,160
and could do so many terrible things.

1502
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Good difference, though.

1503
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,160
I mean, they're basically the same.

1504
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,160
Everyone has new-world orders.

1505
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,160
Everybody has an idea of, like, controlling people

1506
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,160
and, you know, blah, blah.

1507
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
It's just I don't give a shit.

1508
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
What could they possibly do to me

1509
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,160
and Ant scurrying around

1510
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
like, I'm doing nothing to them.

1511
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,160
They could just nuke me right now.

1512
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
They could nuke me and Ant.

1513
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,160
Here's the thing that gives me...

1514
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,160
It would just be a waste of money.

1515
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,160
That's why I was saying, like, money runs the world.

1516
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,160
The most...

1517
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,160
The cheapest thing is probably what they're gonna do.

1518
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,160
Well, right.

1519
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
Even if, like, in the future,

1520
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,160
like I was saying, like, humans are stupid.

1521
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,160
Even if they invent, like, smart robot

1522
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,160
AI people

1523
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,160
to, like, do things

1524
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,160
that humans can't do.

1525
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,160
That's not going to, like,

1526
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
immediately run the world

1527
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,160
because it's gonna be expensive to make stuff like that.

1528
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,160
And, I mean,

1529
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,160
far in the future, it's gonna be less expensive.

1530
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,160
But, like,

1531
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
I feel like

1532
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,160
the amount of money

1533
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,160
things cost

1534
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,160
gives humanity time to adapt

1535
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,160
to whatever changes come about.

1536
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,160
I just don't feel...

1537
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,160
I feel that everything

1538
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,160
that you're saying, Munchie, is real.

1539
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,160
I just don't feel the paranoia about it.

1540
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,160
Because, like...

1541
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,160
What paranoia do you think I'm on edge

1542
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,160
and all hippo? What do you mean?

1543
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
All right. Not paranoia.

1544
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,160
What's the fucking word? Like, I'm fear.

1545
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,160
Like, I don't feel any fear.

1546
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,160
Fear has three instead of an E.

1547
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,160
That's how I am right now.

1548
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,160
The thing that gives me some comfort is the fact that

1549
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,160
at the end of the day, we're all

1550
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,160
the government's pay-piggies, okay?

1551
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,160
And it's much more...

1552
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,160
beneficial for us to be alive

1553
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,160
and continue to give them money

1554
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,160
so they can experiment on black people

1555
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,160
in, like, a backwards country

1556
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,160
than it is to kill us,

1557
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,160
even if we're making some noise.

1558
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
So... Yeah, that's the whole, like,

1559
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,160
the stupid, like, why every, like,

1560
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,160
villain of everything is always

1561
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,160
a complete idiot, because they just want to kill everybody

1562
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,160
so they can rule the world.

1563
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
And then they're just gonna be the king

1564
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,160
of an empty rock. Like, what is the point?

1565
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,160
Yeah, that's dumb. That's dumb.

1566
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,160
I mean, the best villains are the ones...

1567
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,160
I mean, you've probably seen the villain,

1568
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,160
like, tier chart, with the top

1569
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,160
as being, like, one whose motivations

1570
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,160
are, like, as good or better

1571
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,160
than the actual protagonist.

1572
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,160
Like, Vite from Watchmen and whatnot.

1573
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,160
Anti-spirals, et cetera, et cetera.

1574
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,160
Me.

1575
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,160
Thanos from...

1576
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Thanos is up there, you know, in the movies.

1577
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,160
Why didn't Thanos just step

1578
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,160
his fingers in half the effective birth

1579
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,160
rate of all of the universe

1580
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,160
instead of killing people?

1581
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,160
Why didn't Thanos just snap his fingers

1582
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
and have everyone have enough food

1583
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,160
to survive forever?

1584
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
There's some argument about it, but only

1585
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
has so much power or something, and he can't do that.

1586
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,160
It's bullshit. It's lame.

1587
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Why didn't he snap his fingers

1588
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
and then all the anime girls,

1589
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,160
panties flipped up, dude?

1590
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,160
He could have made anime real, and instead

1591
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,160
he killed half the population.

1592
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,160
He could have made anime real.

1593
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,160
Snap his fingers and allow me to learn how to snap.

1594
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,160
I'm trying.

1595
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,160
Do you not know how?

1596
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,160
Fuck you, hippo.

1597
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,160
You're a government. You're a government fucking the shill.

1598
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,160
You're a government.

1599
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,160
I can't do that.

1600
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,160
I can do the eight click.

1601
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,160
I can use all eight of my fingers.

1602
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,160
What's that?

1603
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
I can do that a little bit too. What's that?

1604
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,160
Munchy can't snap.

1605
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,160
Snap. That one's going in my cringe complex.

1606
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,160
I do, man.

1607
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,160
I'm not going to snap for that.

1608
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah, thank you. Appreciate that.

1609
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
Nate, have you ever found yourself

1610
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,160
unfortunate as a reaction

1611
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,160
because I did the other day

1612
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,160
and it was really bizarre?

1613
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,160
I actually did the other day.

1614
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
It was me from a live stream

1615
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,160
holding...

1616
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,160
I think I saved the image or something, I think.

1617
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,160
I'll see if I can dig it up later.

1618
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160
It's me holding my hands over my head with my mouth agape.

1619
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,160
It was not the soy boy pose, but it was similar.

1620
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,160
It was me reacting in horror, probably

1621
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,160
to one of my Pokémon dying

1622
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,160
that somebody posted.

1623
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,160
It was just in the context of

1624
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,160
green texting, some bad thing happens

1625
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,160
my face when.

1626
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,160
It was just like my face.

1627
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,160
What was yours?

1628
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,160
I've actually done some digging into this.

1629
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,160
This was actually a little bit old ago,

1630
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,160
a couple of months ago.

1631
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,160
I found on V, I don't care at all,

1632
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,160
completely randomly.

1633
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,160
I do not go on Twitch a lot.

1634
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,160
I used to go on it a lot, but I only check

1635
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,160
and never go on it.

1636
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,160
But just randomly, this day I come

1637
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,160
and it's a really bizarre photo of me.

1638
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
It's a screenshot from

1639
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,160
I think it's

1640
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,160
one of the Brobnicon videos.

1641
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,160
It's when I'm looking intensely

1642
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,160
into the camera during the course cast.

1643
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,160
The panel or something?

1644
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
And I'm looking as hard as I possibly can.

1645
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,160
And I

1646
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,160
reversed image search using like

1647
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,160
Desu, storage or whatever.

1648
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
That image has been

1649
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,160
used like somewhere a lot.

1650
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,160
Like 11 times over the course of it existing.

1651
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,160
Do you have it saved?

1652
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,160
No, I don't.

1653
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,160
Unfortunately, I don't know.

1654
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,160
I'm sure you could like

1655
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
search 4chan4munchy

1656
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
because I know that at least once

1657
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,160
it has been replied to with

1658
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,160
my name.

1659
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,160
So I'm sure you could find it that way.

1660
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,160
If I can find out,

1661
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,160
I'll give it to Hippo to put in the show notes

1662
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,160
or whoever is editing it.

1663
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
I'll do the same with mine. I'm pretty sure I have it.

1664
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,160
But anyway, it's really weird.

1665
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,160
Whoever is doing that,

1666
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,160
why? I don't mind.

1667
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,160
If I were to be

1668
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,160
a reaction image,

1669
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,160
I could live with myself.

1670
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160
That'd be a pretty good life.

1671
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,160
But I don't know. I don't know what's happening

1672
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
right now. And I like it.

1673
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
I like it, to be honest with you.

1674
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,160
It's funny

1675
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,160
and fun is what I have to say about that.

1676
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,160
It makes me laugh.

1677
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,160
Being talked about on 4chan

1678
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,160
is sort of a mythical experience.

1679
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
Yeah.

1680
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,160
It's something about it.

1681
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160
It's really just a forum

1682
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,160
and whatever.

1683
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,160
But

1684
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,160
the harsh community there

1685
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,160
is really interesting

1686
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,160
to see what they say

1687
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,160
because they can be as

1688
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
brutally honest as possible

1689
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,160
and you don't know who it is.

1690
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,160
I know about it.

1691
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
How brutally unfiltered it is

1692
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
and completely unapologetic.

1693
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,160
Whenever I want the raw shit,

1694
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
I just go to 4chan.

1695
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,160
I don't go to fucking Kotaku.

1696
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
I don't go to Polygon.

1697
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,160
I never get the sensation of

1698
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
just a mass of people I don't know who they are.

1699
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,160
I always feel like

1700
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,160
it's not like I can tell who's making each post.

1701
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,160
But I feel like it just is

1702
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,160
a person who I'm talking to.

1703
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,160
I don't know what they look like.

1704
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
There's like some illusion

1705
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
is created through 4chan

1706
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,160
of that effect.

1707
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
I kind of take their opinions far more

1708
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
valuably than I would

1709
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,160
any individual person who is saying it.

1710
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,160
I guess it's because there's no ego

1711
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
to protect at that point.

1712
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
It's straight up.

1713
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,160
That's true. I think that's a big plus.

1714
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,160
It's a big plus.

1715
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,160
I mean there's kind of an ego because

1716
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,160
people can reply and say that's dumb

1717
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
and see all the replies.

1718
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
It's a big currency.

1719
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
Everybody wants those sweet use.

1720
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Yeah.

1721
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,160
I was in

1722
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
Hawaii recently, as you all know.

1723
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,160
And I was snorkeling

1724
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,160
for the first time in my life.

1725
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,160
And a side note.

1726
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,160
I believe any animal can kill me.

1727
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,160
Fish, pigeon, dog, rat,

1728
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,160
rabbit, anything.

1729
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,160
There's a lot of those fish and those snorkeling things.

1730
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,160
It could very easily kill me.

1731
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,160
I'm talking about a little baby bunny.

1732
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Shark attacks are not uncommon.

1733
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,160
If a rabbit

1734
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,160
truly wanted to,

1735
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,160
I could think of like seven

1736
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,160
different ways it could kill me.

1737
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,160
I see Monty Python.

1738
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,160
I've never seen that.

1739
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,160
But if it really wanted to,

1740
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
if it's got big buck teeth,

1741
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,160
it could kill me.

1742
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
That is true.

1743
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,160
If you stood there, if you laid down

1744
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,160
and you didn't try to run away.

1745
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,160
And you gave it like 20 minutes to gnaw through your jugular.

1746
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,160
You know what rabbits,

1747
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
this is completely different from what I was about to say.

1748
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,160
But rabbits are the government.

1749
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
I know they probably will kill you.

1750
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,160
But they can, therefore, I will never trust them.

1751
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
I cannot look

1752
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,160
at a bunny

1753
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,160
and like not fear abject

1754
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,160
horror. Because I know

1755
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,160
what it could do to me. It doesn't matter if it will,

1756
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,160
but it could.

1757
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,160
Is it because like you can't?

1758
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,160
Is it because like you can't?

1759
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,160
Is it because

1760
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,160
bunnies look cute?

1761
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
But you can't see their teeth normally.

1762
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,160
Yes. And I know that they have them.

1763
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,160
They're hiding it from me. It's a concealed carry.

1764
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,160
It's like a fucking mass shooter walking

1765
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,160
into a target with a gun in his belt.

1766
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,160
That's exactly what it's like.

1767
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,160
All bunnies are wearing burkas.

1768
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,160
It's just terrifying. What's under there?

1769
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,160
We don't know.

1770
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,160
Okay, another aside besides the bunny one.

1771
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,160
I am so surprised

1772
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,160
that mass shootings don't happen all the time.

1773
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,160
Because like, okay, this will sound

1774
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,160
vaguely like gun control, but I don't mean it in a way.

1775
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,160
But like,

1776
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,160
if you are just like a normal person

1777
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,160
and you know, you pass all background shelks

1778
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,160
and you're not like insane. You're just a normal person.

1779
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,160
You can reasonably acquire a gun in America.

1780
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
So like, couldn't you just

1781
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
be normal and then just decide

1782
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,160
to shoot a lot of people and then like,

1783
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
can't you like, you can just get a gun

1784
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
and then like, walk into

1785
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,160
a Chipotle and kill everyone

1786
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,160
in the Chipotle. There's nothing to stop you.

1787
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,160
I don't think there should be something to stop. I'm just saying, you know,

1788
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,160
like, you could do that. So why doesn't that happen?

1789
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,160
I wouldn't mind if your gun shot's outside my day all the time.

1790
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,160
Part of being normal

1791
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,160
is not wanting to shoot someone.

1792
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,160
Yeah.

1793
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Mass shootings do happen in America.

1794
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,160
Literally, I think it's more than once per day.

1795
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,160
Like, throughout the country.

1796
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,160
Which is, that's pretty high.

1797
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,160
I don't think that's true.

1798
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,160
I think shootings probably happen, but not mass shootings.

1799
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
Well, when I say mass shooting,

1800
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,160
it's like, that doesn't involve

1801
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,160
like 20 people dying. It's like one

1802
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
or more people dying from like a public shooting

1803
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,160
event or something.

1804
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,160
It's not a mass shooting.

1805
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,160
Let me quickly interject.

1806
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,160
From what I've heard,

1807
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,160
I could be wrong, but from what I've heard,

1808
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,160
those statistics,

1809
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,160
whichever say like about the mass shootings,

1810
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,160
they're overblown because

1811
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,160
they include people that like accidental

1812
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
discharges and stuff like that.

1813
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,160
Okay, that's possible. It's definitely possible.

1814
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,160
And this is like a guns thing.

1815
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,160
Go to the most gun-respective

1816
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,160
country on earth. Go to wherever.

1817
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Go to the country where they don't even have

1818
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,160
like any weapons. They have no knives or anything.

1819
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,160
If you get a fork

1820
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
or like chopsticks or anything,

1821
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,160
it's so easy to kill people.

1822
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,160
Why is there not just death in the street

1823
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,160
all the time? Here, let me explain

1824
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,160
to the thing that you have just

1825
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,160
explained to us.

1826
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,160
It's because the bunny's there. The bunny is there.

1827
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,160
And everybody knows the bunny has sharp teeth.

1828
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,160
Yeah. So like they, and if

1829
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,160
you kill a person, the bunny will bite you.

1830
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,160
It will do. So like people don't

1831
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,160
kill because they'll be attacked

1832
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,160
by the government. And the government is so much stronger

1833
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,160
than just, you know,

1834
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,160
you with your gun.

1835
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,160
You'd have to be completely delusional to actually

1836
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,160
go on a mass shooting, which is why people

1837
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,160
who go on mass shootings are like

1838
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,160
mentally fucked up in some way.

1839
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Yeah. Like even, I'm sure plenty of people,

1840
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,160
we've all had fantasies about like,

1841
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
I just want to kill XYZ

1842
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,160
person because they're annoying me right now.

1843
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,160
But some people, I don't know, I guess

1844
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
the difference is that some people are unhinged enough

1845
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,160
to then act on those pretty normal impulses.

1846
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,160
I mean, way, way back, way

1847
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,160
back, like in medieval,

1848
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
like probably pre-medieval England

1849
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,160
or whatever. People, the way

1850
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,160
it would work, because there's no police, there's

1851
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,160
none of that. If somebody

1852
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,160
like has a fight, an argument with somebody

1853
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,160
and they kill them, then

1854
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,160
that's just okay. Like, oh shit, that guy

1855
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,160
killed that other guy. And if

1856
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,160
yeah, you know, the guy's brother or something

1857
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,160
comes up to him and says, you killed

1858
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
my brother, I'll kill you. And then he kills him.

1859
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,160
And then that's justice. That is

1860
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,160
that was what it was like. Yeah.

1861
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,160
Killing is not, it's not necessarily

1862
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,160
a thing that is like humans

1863
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,160
are afraid of. But

1864
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,160
you know, like, like in a society

1865
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,160
where killing would be more normal,

1866
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,160
we would do have, you know, have more

1867
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,160
shootings. But the reason we don't is because

1868
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
the government will kill us.

1869
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,160
That's true. I was having this feeling in a

1870
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,160
Chipotle, where I just was walking

1871
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,160
to get, oh, here's my Chipotle order.

1872
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,160
It's a burrito, brown rice, fajitas, double

1873
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,160
steak, queso, hot sauce,

1874
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,160
and cheese. And then I get a small water

1875
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,160
and it's always free. They just ask for

1876
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,160
a small cup of water, but I fill up the brim of water

1877
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,160
because I don't put ice cubes in, because I'm on a bitch

1878
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,160
scum. Anyway, oh, here's Chipotle.

1879
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,160
There was a full line. There was like 10

1880
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,160
people. There were like five people in the back

1881
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,160
of like five employees. And there was like

1882
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,160
a couple of people scattered around. He was kind of a big

1883
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,160
Chipotle. So there was like, like

1884
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,160
30 people. I think if I have a gun right

1885
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,160
now, I can kill at least

1886
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,160
10 people. At least 10 people

1887
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,160
would be dead if I

1888
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,160
had a gun right now. So I was

1889
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,160
just thinking, like, it's so easy.

1890
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,160
Like, there must, like,

1891
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,160
it's like, it can't be that crazy to do.

1892
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,160
You're right. It is easy. It's just that

1893
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,160
most people legitimately don't want

1894
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,160
to shoot up an area. I can't

1895
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,160
believe that, Nate. I can't believe people

1896
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,160
don't feel the way I do. All I'm getting from

1897
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,160
this conversation is that Munchie really wants to kill

1898
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,160
some people. No, no, no, no.

1899
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,160
It's easy.

1900
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,160
I've had thoughts like this at a

1901
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,160
similar age where it's like, man,

1902
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,160
if I had a gun, I mean, I could,

1903
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
you know? But it's what

1904
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,160
that is. It's not that anybody is insane

1905
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,160
or like a gun nut or like,

1906
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,160
you know, it's just like your

1907
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,160
brain is like

1908
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,160
considering possibilities that you don't

1909
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,160
consider normally. And it's for the first

1910
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,160
time, like, you're doing this, I guess, for like

1911
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,160
more often than you have done

1912
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,160
in the past. It's just sort of like

1913
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,160
blowing your mind because it's just

1914
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,160
a new thought. Like, I've had

1915
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,160
thoughts like, man, that guy really pissed

1916
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,160
me off. Wonder what would happen if I

1917
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
stabbed him up and shanked him in

1918
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,160
a cool anime way. That's

1919
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,160
what you get for messing with me. That's

1920
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,160
what you get for bullying little old me.

1921
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,160
And I imagine it and it's like, oh,

1922
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,160
oh, god.

1923
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,160
Am I an evil man? No, I'm not.

1924
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
It's just the way your brain

1925
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,160
sorts this sort of

1926
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,160
stuff out is you just imagine it

1927
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,160
and then it's gone.

1928
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,160
Yeah, they're all intrusive thoughts of it.

1929
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,160
Yeah.

1930
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,160
If I

1931
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,160
kill everyone in Chipotle,

1932
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,160
will I go to jail? Yes.

1933
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,160
Not if they can't catch you. Not if you kill

1934
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,160
every policeman who comes to get you.

1935
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,160
Just keep the kill train running.

1936
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,160
Okay, wait, okay. Go infinite with it.

1937
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,160
Guys, guys, the perfect

1938
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,160
crime. I've

1939
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,160
come up with it. If you shoot

1940
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,160
the police, they can't arrest

1941
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,160
you.

1942
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,160
Wait, I've cracked

1943
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,160
the code. That sounds like

1944
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,160
cop killer talk, frankly.

1945
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Oh, okay, no, you guys

1946
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
need to understand. It's not that

1947
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,160
me, the Renault Africa in a cop killer is

1948
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,160
mutually excusable. It's that Ben is the

1949
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
cop killer and he is 51%

1950
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,160
in favor of killing cops.

1951
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,160
And 49%

1952
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,160
rowdy. And I am 51% rowdy

1953
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,160
and 49% in favor

1954
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,160
of killing cops. And yet there can be no

1955
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,160
peace. There can never be peace.

1956
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
Yeah, yeah, under no

1957
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,160
circumstances.

1958
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,160
I was actually getting to

1959
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,160
an actual real point about

1960
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,160
when I started this.

1961
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
I remember.

1962
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
It is illegal to touch

1963
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,160
a turtle in Hawaii.

1964
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,160
Oh, that was a big thing. Yep, I remember

1965
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,160
that. Because they want to

1966
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,160
protect them.

1967
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,160
I assumed this was just something that they

1968
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,160
tell you to be like, don't touch a turtle.

1969
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,160
But I was researching.

1970
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,160
The news article is about some guy

1971
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,160
on the news

1972
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,160
some guy was like, man

1973
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,160
harassing a turtle.

1974
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,160
And it was like some guy touching a turtle shell.

1975
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,160
And so

1976
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,160
I was snorkeling for the first time.

1977
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,160
I see a huge fucking tortoise

1978
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,160
and I swim.

1979
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,160
It was huge. It was like the size of

1980
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,160
me. It was the size of me.

1981
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,160
That's fucking dope. I saw some on the beach, but never underwater.

1982
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,160
It was great. It was fantastic.

1983
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,160
And I swim over to him and I touch him.

1984
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,160
Oh my god.

1985
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,160
You're just committed to a crime in Hawaii.

1986
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,160
Don't touch the turtle. It's illegal.

1987
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Stop touching the turtle.

1988
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,160
Michelle made it

1989
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,160
in no uncertain terms. Michelle made it

1990
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,160
explicitly clear what will happen

1991
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,160
to me if I touch a fucking turtle.

1992
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,160
You will be ran out of town

1993
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,160
and murdered by the locals if you touch

1994
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,160
a fucking turtle. And Tom

1995
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,160
before you say anything, I just thought

1996
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,160
well then let him die.

1997
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,160
If I can't touch this

1998
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,160
turtle, why should it exist?

1999
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,160
That's what I feel about women.

2000
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,160
Why should we protect turtles?

2001
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,160
If they do not pleasure me, if they do not pleasure humans

2002
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,160
then why do we let them exist?

2003
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,160
They are in our

2004
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,160
world. We may have been not

2005
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,160
equal terms when we were animals, but we have risen

2006
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,160
above them and we could easily

2007
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,160
kill every... we're well

2008
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,160
in our way. They're endangered.

2009
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,160
We could easily wipe out every turtle we want

2010
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,160
to. So if it is not bow to

2011
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,160
my whim and let me touch him

2012
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
then what is the point of them

2013
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
existing? Munchie, now you're the bunny

2014
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,160
of the animal kingdom.

2015
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,160
Well, all I'm saying

2016
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,160
is I want to touch a turtle because I like

2017
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,160
Mr. Turtle. It's this

2018
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,160
Mambi Pambi-Pita

2019
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,160
Nambla Alliance that protects

2020
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,160
these turtles because they like... ooh, we like them.

2021
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,160
We want them to continue to exist.

2022
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,160
They're cool and all. And I mean

2023
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,160
I guess that's true. No, turtles are cool.

2024
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,160
That's why I want to touch it.

2025
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,160
I want to touch it because I like it.

2026
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
I like it. Yeah.

2027
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,160
You can see a turtle image

2028
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,160
and video online

2029
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,160
right now on your local Google.

2030
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,160
You don't need to go to Hawaii

2031
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,160
but the point of seeing a turtle

2032
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,160
in real life is the 3D

2033
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
interaction in real life. You

2034
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,160
get to see him react to you doing a funny dance.

2035
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,160
That's true. You get to see him

2036
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,160
like if you give

2037
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,160
a leaf to him and he chomps on it.

2038
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,160
That's the leaf I gave him that you're eating.

2039
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,160
Even something like that is like

2040
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,160
that's why you go to see animals of the zoo

2041
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,160
is to see what they do.

2042
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,160
Is it legal in Hawaii to give

2043
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,160
a turtle a leaf to eat?

2044
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,160
Frankly, you're like not allowed

2045
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,160
to go within like some

2046
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,160
number of feet of a turtle.

2047
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,160
It's just stay the fuck away

2048
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,160
from turtles in Hawaii.

2049
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,160
There has to be a reason.

2050
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,160
The reason is because they're an endangered species

2051
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,160
and they really want to protect the ecosystem.

2052
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,160
Hawaii is 100%

2053
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,160
hardcore about keep Hawaii

2054
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,160
as sick as Hawaii is now.

2055
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Department of Agriculture shit

2056
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,160
around like every corner.

2057
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,160
You have to sign those forms when you go to Hawaii

2058
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,160
that says I am not bringing in any outside

2059
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,160
plants that could possibly fuck up the

2060
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,160
ecosystem of Hawaii.

2061
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,160
There are a few issues with mongooses

2062
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,160
I understand.

2063
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Dude, did you see a wild mongoose out there?

2064
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,160
I saw a bunch of them. They were fucking

2065
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,160
awesome.

2066
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,160
There's a contradiction here.

2067
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,160
You can't touch the turtles

2068
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,160
because they're trying to artificially keep

2069
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,160
the turtle population going.

2070
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,160
But you can't bring seeds because they're trying to

2071
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,160
make sure nature takes its course.

2072
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,160
Let the turtles spend for themselves.

2073
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,160
Let nature happen.

2074
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,160
They want nature to interact with the turtles.

2075
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,160
They don't want the human population

2076
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,160
to interact with the turtles.

2077
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,160
We're not part of nature.

2078
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,160
We're literally better than nature

2079
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,160
is what we are now.

2080
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,160
This reminds me.

2081
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,160
This reminds me.

2082
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,160
It's just a human hand.

2083
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,160
They're not going to touch me.

2084
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
It's a fish.

2085
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,160
This is the natural

2086
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,160
course of evolution.

2087
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,160
Some rat or some potato

2088
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,160
is going to evolve to be

2089
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,160
a shout.

2090
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,160
This is how sharks get opposable thumbs.

2091
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,160
It's going to evolve to have the human

2092
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,160
facade so that cows like sea turtles

2093
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,160
are lulled into a false sense of security.

2094
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,160
Oh, it's just my farmer.

2095
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,160
No, it's a gross potato.

2096
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,160
I'll kill you.

2097
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,160
It's kind of like mimics from RPGs

2098
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,160
that member of Treasure Chest

2099
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,160
only talking like full human.

2100
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,160
Speaking of sharks with arms,

2101
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,160
I'm imagining that.

2102
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,160
It's really funny that he would swim real fast

2103
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,160
and then just punch you instead of punching you.

2104
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,160
This turtle reminds me.

2105
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,160
They're not that aggressive.

2106
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,160
I mean, some sharks are not all of them.

2107
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,160
Snapping turtles are assholes

2108
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,160
and they're monsters that should be wiped out

2109
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,160
the face of the earth.

2110
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,160
Turtle Gate.

2111
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,160
That is the title of this

2112
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,160
PCP episode, Turtle Gate.

2113
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,160
This Turtle Gate turtle

2114
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,160
reminds me of a fountain.

2115
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,160
Of a fountain near my home, San Diego,

2116
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,160
Balboa Park, Google it.

2117
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,160
I'm going to show you an image.

2118
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,160
There's watermarks. This is a fountain.

2119
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,160
It's good.

2120
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,160
When I was a little baby lad,

2121
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,160
you could walk in that fountain.

2122
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,160
I remember we went on a field trip

2123
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,160
to Balboa Park

2124
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,160
to play in the fountain and it was great.

2125
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,160
It was a great time.

2126
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,160
You go to Balboa Park now.

2127
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,160
Do not go in the fountain!

2128
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,160
Danger! You can drown

2129
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,160
in this one feet of water.

2130
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,160
It's extremely important

2131
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,160
that you do not enter this water.

2132
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,160
Then why is it here?

2133
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,160
Why do fountains exist

2134
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,160
if I cannot play in the fountain?

2135
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,160
It is despicable.

2136
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,160
Even if, let's just say,

2137
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,160
a baby drowned in that fountain.

2138
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,160
I don't know that it did,

2139
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,160
but even if it did,

2140
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,160
why should that ruin

2141
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,160
everyone's good time forever?

2142
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,160
Here's the point.

2143
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,160
Hold on.

2144
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,160
A quick point about the fountain thing.

2145
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,160
I'm not sure how fountains work,

2146
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
but I'm pretty sure they recycle the same water.

2147
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,160
It goes into some pipes

2148
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,160
and goes out in the fountain again.

2149
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,160
If someone, let's say,

2150
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,160
goes into the fountain and pees

2151
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,160
or whatever,

2152
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,160
they have HIV or something,

2153
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,160
everyone in the fountain

2154
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,160
gets infected.

2155
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,160
This is kind of a question.

2156
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,160
Infected people with HIV

2157
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,160
isn't even a felony anymore, so it's fine.

2158
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,160
Are you not allowed to go in the fountain,

2159
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,160
or are you discouraged heavily?

2160
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,160
No, you're not allowed.

2161
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,160
That's what I thought.

2162
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,160
That's some bullshit.

2163
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
I think if a baby drowned in there,

2164
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,160
that wouldn't be the baby disobeying

2165
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,160
the rules.

2166
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,160
If there's a rule that you can't swim

2167
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,160
in the thing,

2168
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,160
a baby is going to not notice

2169
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
and fall and die,

2170
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,160
regardless of the rule,

2171
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,160
it's up to the parent to make sure

2172
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,160
the baby doesn't fall.

2173
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,160
It made you respond to your point.

2174
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,160
I'm not saying there should be rules

2175
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,160
to play in the fountain.

2176
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,160
If you want to have a no-peeing rule,

2177
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,160
I understand.

2178
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,160
But the fact that no one

2179
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,160
is even allowed to interact with this fountain

2180
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,160
in any way,

2181
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,160
that far-fetched

2182
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,160
HIV-P scenario,

2183
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,160
when I pee, I spread my HIV.

2184
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,160
I piss on every animal that I can see.

2185
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,160
I infect as many as I can. It's like a video game to me.

2186
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,160
But still, that will probably

2187
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,160
never happen. But even if it does,

2188
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,160
in that one scenario,

2189
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,160
that shouldn't affect

2190
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,160
the 99 other percent of the population.

2191
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,160
I was just playing devils out of a good munchie.

2192
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,160
Sure, I understand.

2193
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,160
Here's a great example of some, though.

2194
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,160
In Hawaii,

2195
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,160
the beaches are public. As I said,

2196
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,160
there are no lifeguards, and you can go to

2197
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,160
any place where the water touches the land.

2198
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,160
You're allowed to just go there, because it's all public.

2199
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,160
So, like, among the

2200
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,160
places we went to, me and Michelle went to, like, this big, huge,

2201
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,160
rocky fucking place

2202
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,160
with incredibly huge waves, and we just went in the water,

2203
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,160
and you can just die

2204
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,160
there, and people do

2205
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,160
all the time. But we just didn't

2206
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,160
give a fuck, and nobody tried to stop us,

2207
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,160
and it was great. And I want to do that

2208
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,160
all the time. Let me die.

2209
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,160
Let the evolutionary process take its course

2210
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,160
and wipe me out.

2211
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,160
Right? I would agree.

2212
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,160
It's these meddling moms.

2213
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,160
It's fucking meddling parents,

2214
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,160
fucking helicopter parents, that only have one fucking

2215
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,160
kid, and they, uh, I care about my kids

2216
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,160
so much. Your child should die.

2217
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,160
Uh, if you're, if,

2218
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,160
okay, just across the board, your child should be dead.

2219
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,160
Uh, but specifically,

2220
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,160
we need to, danger is, like, good

2221
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,160
for people. You should have to face danger

2222
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,160
and be responsible for yourself.

2223
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,160
It's fucking nanny state cowards

2224
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,160
expecting, like, uh, why isn't there systems

2225
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,160
in place to protect me from every danger in the fucking

2226
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,160
world? Maybe because we can't afford to protect

2227
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
you from every fucking problem that exists

2228
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
on the planet. It's not even like they're doing it out of, like, a genuine

2229
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,160
care. It's because they don't, they don't reflect badly

2230
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
on them, like, oh, I'll be a bad parent if my

2231
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,160
kid gets fucked up. I'm sure there's some of that.

2232
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,160
I'm sure there's some of that. You've got responsibility. Disgusting.

2233
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,160
Disgusting.

2234
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,160
People are weaned. In regards to

2235
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,160
into the, the, the dangerous

2236
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
rocky area. Yeah.

2237
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,160
I think most people with, uh,

2238
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,160
sensible senses will see

2239
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,160
that it could be dangerous, but sometimes

2240
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:25,160
something looks fine and, like,

2241
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,160
there's a weird, uh, current

2242
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,160
and that you could get dragged out or, like, dragged against

2243
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,160
some rocks and die in a way

2244
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,160
that, like, I don't think

2245
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,160
there should ever be a rule to say you can't swim

2246
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,160
there, um, but there should be

2247
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,160
signs up if something is, like, kind of dangerous.

2248
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,160
There are signs. I can do it.

2249
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,160
There are signs up on every beach in Hawaii.

2250
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,160
Every beach I went to there was, like,

2251
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,160
you will die in this water if you go to it.

2252
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,160
Alright. Then, then that's good.

2253
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,160
I think, I think we can all agree that that makes a lot of sense.

2254
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,160
People, yeah, yeah. But, but I would say

2255
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,160
that, like, it's not anyone's

2256
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,160
legislation. That's my motto.

2257
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,160
And it's no one's responsibility

2258
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,160
to make sure you're safe. It's your responsibility.

2259
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,160
Like, so you've got to just,

2260
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,160
I don't know, like, sure,

2261
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,160
we want to rely on each other and, like, share

2262
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,160
knowledge about, like, this beach is safe, this beach

2263
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,160
is dangerous, you know, people have died there, so, you know,

2264
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,160
take that into account and then go be free

2265
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,160
and then go live your life and do whatever you want.

2266
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,160
That's, that's what I dream of.

2267
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,160
Yeah.

2268
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,160
I'm saying is that I am not

2269
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,160
allowed to touch this fucking turtle. I don't know why,

2270
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,160
why even they fucking exist.

2271
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,160
We can easily nuke who I can finish the job

2272
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,160
we fucking started.

2273
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,160
It could be under fucking water.

2274
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,160
If you don't let me touch this turtle,

2275
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,160
then why do you

2276
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,160
look, we can play a settler game here.

2277
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,160
We can play a settler game. Let's just,

2278
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,160
let's just provoke North Korea

2279
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,160
a little bit more, a little bit more,

2280
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,160
and get them to do our dirty work for us.

2281
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,160
I'm ringing up old Kim Jong right now.

2282
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,160
Today I learned

2283
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,160
baby turtles are penises

2284
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,160
and they have foreskin.

2285
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,160
Oh yeah, we can just fake and make the

2286
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:57,160
volcanoes erupt. Easy.

2287
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,160
Easy.

2288
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,160
That being said, I love turtles, they're my best friend

2289
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,160
and I am king of the turtles and

2290
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,160
they have elected me as their president slash god

2291
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,160
and I rule over them.

2292
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,160
I think I, you know, due to my new

2293
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,160
found superiority when it comes

2294
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,160
to communicating with turtles, I speak

2295
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,160
for them and myself when I say that they

2296
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,160
love to be touched and they want nothing

2297
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,160
more than to be my personal pet.

2298
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,160
You should get a turtle or a tortoise.

2299
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,160
I will.

2300
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,160
I mean turtles are really the, the, the, the

2301
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,160
optimal state of everything we've talked about. Think about it.

2302
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,160
They have a shell so they can hide from the

2303
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,160
prying eyes of the government and they can

2304
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,160
go off grid and live wherever they want

2305
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,160
to live.

2306
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,160
I think turtles are the best friends on their back.

2307
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,160
Oh my god. Guys. Okay. Idea.

2308
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,160
Like hashtag idea. This is even better

2309
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,160
than my shooting cops idea.

2310
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,160
Okay.

2311
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,160
Okay. If you hold on to a turtle

2312
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,160
and you let him carry you away, then you'll

2313
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,160
be in the ocean and no one will be able to

2314
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,160
find you. So you can live off the grid

2315
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,160
with turtles. Damn.

2316
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,160
That's smart. That's smart.

2317
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,160
Well, uh, is it, is it fair to say munchy

2318
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,160
and everyone that the summary of this

2319
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,160
is that, is that, is that good me?

2320
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,160
Yeah, I think it is. Is that good me?

2321
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,160
He had juggalo mask on.

2322
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,160
Oh my god. Okay. Okay.

2323
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,160
Okay. Hashtag idea again. I'm just fucking

2324
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,160
I'm wrapping fire in this shit out right now.

2325
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,160
I'm having fucking brain blasts of a brain which

2326
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,160
I am baby Einstein right now.

2327
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,160
All right.

2328
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,160
Instead of juggalo face paint

2329
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,160
it should be called juggalo face like

2330
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,160
blackface because it's just as offensive.

2331
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,160
If you want a real juggalo point on juggalo

2332
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,160
face, then I don't want to fucking see you

2333
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,160
near me. Yeah, that's good.

2334
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,160
Stay a half mile away at least.

2335
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,160
I find like, like, the equivalent

2336
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,160
would be like somebody who just has a

2337
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,160
skin condition that makes them look like a juggalo

2338
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,160
because like, like blackface is

2339
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,160
then putting on makeup to make them look

2340
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,160
like something else. Yeah, yeah. And a juggalo

2341
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,160
puts on makeup to be themselves

2342
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,160
but if you don't put on makeup

2343
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,160
and you just have a skin condition that makes you look like a juggalo

2344
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,160
that's offensive.

2345
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,160
I agree. You need to be purged.

2346
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,160
Do we all agree that human happiness

2347
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,160
comes over all animals?

2348
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,160
Do we not agree with that? Yes.

2349
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,160
Well, actually, I would say it's a little more

2350
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,160
if we ever found an animal that had a human level

2351
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,160
sentience, we would need to incorporate that.

2352
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,160
Yes. I mean, I mean, sentient life

2353
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,160
equals

2354
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,160
greater than like a fucking cow

2355
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,160
or something. 100%.

2356
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,160
So I should be able to

2357
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,160
do whatever I want to any animal

2358
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,160
at any time. I don't want

2359
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:27,160
to kill animals. So I'm a nice guy.

2360
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,160
I'm not going to hurt it.

2361
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,160
I just want to be able to touch it.

2362
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,160
All I'm saying is that I am a good person

2363
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,160
and I alone should

2364
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,160
have domain over the tourists.

2365
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,160
Honestly.

2366
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,160
I suppose the counter argument there would be

2367
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,160
is that like animals are part of like the

2368
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,160
ecosystem and that if you brazenly

2369
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,160
destroy them, like you're

2370
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,160
inadvertently fucking up your own happiness.

2371
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,160
Yeah, it's not about the animals.

2372
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,160
It's about like other people who live there

2373
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,160
want to enjoy turtle culture

2374
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,160
and they don't want you fucking it up with

2375
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,160
your radical, you know, right wing

2376
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,160
ideas about reforming the government,

2377
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,160
the turtle government that is, and, you know,

2378
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,160
overthrowing shit.

2379
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,160
The turtles need to secede, I think.

2380
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,160
They need to get their own independence.

2381
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,160
They need to see, see the

2382
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,160
oceans right now.

2383
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,160
Just a quick question. It makes me happy.

2384
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:17,160
Oh, yeah. Okay. I'm just making sure

2385
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,160
you could hear me. Okay, because I said something

2386
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,160
and no one heard it and now the only...

2387
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,160
Oh, no, we just thought it was shit.

2388
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,160
No, we didn't hear it.

2389
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,160
No, but no,

2390
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,160
only the editor will know what I said.

2391
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,160
So, have fun. Okay.

2392
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,160
Alright.

2393
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,160
Guys, we've been talking forever about this bullshit.

2394
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,160
Maybe it's time to move on to calls and stuff.

2395
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,160
I think it's time. Please, guys.

2396
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,160
Um, I just want...

2397
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,160
Hashtag Turlegate

2398
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,160
at Hawaii right now on Twitter

2399
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,160
with my hashtag idea.

2400
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,160
Let's know about hashtag Turlegate.

2401
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,160
Exactly. You want to be able to touch turtles?

2402
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,160
Yes, yes. I, alone,

2403
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,160
I don't want to reform the law.

2404
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,160
I want you to make a new law

2405
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,160
forbidding anyone else but me

2406
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,160
from touching turtles.

2407
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,160
Those Hurraions are wily. We need to

2408
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
resurrect the zombie King Kamehameha

2409
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,160
and have a commandment be ordered

2410
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,160
so that you're allowed to touch the turtles.

2411
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,160
Kamehameha was such a fucking cuck.

2412
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,160
He was so... No, he wasn't. He was a fucking warlord.

2413
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,160
He fucking killed everyone. It was pretty cool.

2414
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Yeah, he was like, oh, the British hot,

2415
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,160
like, hey, dude, please, annex us.

2416
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,160
Please, please. I'll put my...

2417
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,160
I'll put your flag on my flag. Please, please.

2418
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,160
I thought he was super opposed to that.

2419
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,160
Am I wrong? Is that totally wrong?

2420
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,160
Look at the Hawaiian flag.

2421
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,160
Well, I mean, it's that now, but I didn't think it used to be.

2422
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,160
Uh, maybe it was changed.

2423
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,160
I know that when it became

2424
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,160
a republic, not a kingdom.

2425
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,160
The colors, the stripes were flipped upside down

2426
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,160
but the union jacks still there.

2427
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,160
The union jacks still there.

2428
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,160
By the way, the Hawaiian flag sucks.

2429
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,160
And every time I saw the Hawaiian flag, I barfed a little bit

2430
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,160
Hang on, Hawaiian flag...

2431
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,160
Let me see.

2432
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,160
It has a union jack on it.

2433
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,160
Dude, it looks dope.

2434
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,160
Are you retarded, question mark?

2435
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,160
Look at this flag. I think it looks dope.

2436
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,160
It's good.

2437
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,160
Is that the Hawaiian flag?

2438
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,160
Yeah.

2439
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,160
It's so weird.

2440
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,160
I was thinking of that too.

2441
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,160
England and Russia had a baby and it was Hawaii.

2442
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,160
That makes sense. That makes sense to me.

2443
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,160
It's super fucking weird and busy.

2444
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,160
Yeah.

2445
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,160
This is not designed very well.

2446
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,160
Okay.

2447
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,160
Real quick, the bars

2448
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,160
have always annoyed me.

2449
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,160
Look at the red bars going diagonally.

2450
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,160
They do not meet

2451
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,160
in the center.

2452
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,160
They are off-center from each other.

2453
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,160
What is the deal?

2454
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,160
What's up with that?

2455
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,160
The Irish flag is weird.

2456
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,160
They want to preserve how the Irish flag sucks.

2457
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,160
Not like the Republic of Ireland,

2458
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,160
like Northern Ireland or something.

2459
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,160
Right.

2460
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,160
God, it pisses me off. I hate it.

2461
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,160
It's terrible.

2462
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,160
The Northern Ireland flag

2463
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:55,160
is just like a normal fucking cross.

2464
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,160
It's not a weird one.

2465
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,160
It just is normal.

2466
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,160
I forget why they do that.

2467
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,160
That's an aesthetic as fuck flag.

2468
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,160
I know what you're saying.

2469
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,160
I agree with you.

2470
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,160
I don't know why the stripes on the union jack are not like that.

2471
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,160
Is it Scotland?

2472
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,160
What they're doing,

2473
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,160
if you see underneath

2474
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,160
the horizontal vertical cross

2475
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,160
in the middle,

2476
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
the diagonals

2477
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,160
are making a very, very, very tiny swastika.

2478
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,160
You can't really see it.

2479
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,160
That's what it's doing.

2480
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,160
Here's another visual meme.

2481
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,160
This is a Hawaiian flag I can get behind.

2482
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,160
Resurrect the empire now.

2483
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,160
I love the cropping on that.

2484
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,160
I love the same quality.

2485
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,160
Oh my god, guys.

2486
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,160
There are questions in a second.

2487
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,160
I have to tell you about the dinosaurs.

2488
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,160
The dinosaurs in Hawaii are rampant

2489
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,160
and they are on the loose.

2490
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,160
Every single time that I entered

2491
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,160
a fucking car

2492
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,160
I would hear

2493
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,160
these two guys

2494
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,160
of very different my qualities.

2495
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,160
I mentioned a blue snowball.

2496
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,160
Over the radio?

2497
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,160
Yeah, a commercial on the radio.

2498
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,160
Living breathing dinosaurs!

2499
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,160
Can't see the belly cover

2500
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,160
the sun right there.

2501
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,160
Breathing dinosaurs!

2502
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,160
He had a baby T-Rex!

2503
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,160
He had a wife!

2504
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,160
Two people screaming

2505
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,160
for like,

2506
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,160
three minutes

2507
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,160
of non-fat back and forth.

2508
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,160
Come see dinosaurs!

2509
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,160
Who in the mouth?

2510
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,160
Military discount!

2511
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,160
Living breathing dinosaurs!

2512
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,160
That's like back and forth.

2513
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,160
It's like JurassicTour.com

2514
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:37,160
Yeah, because they filmed Jurassic Park there.

2515
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,160
Yeah, something like that.

2516
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,160
And it was just fucking

2517
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,160
every single time I got in the car.

2518
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,160
I heard that commercial

2519
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,160
eight times. I haven't memorized

2520
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,160
back to fucking back.

2521
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,160
You could be listening to some shitty

2522
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:53,160
R&B or whatever other shit stuff

2523
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:55,160
that Hawaiians are listening to nowadays.

2524
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,160
And then it's like, I love your baby

2525
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,160
and fades out. Living breathing

2526
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:01,160
dinosaurs here in Hawaii!

2527
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,160
Why?

2528
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,160
Why did the guy

2529
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,160
have such a shit microphone?

2530
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,160
I don't know!

2531
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,160
It was so bad!

2532
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,160
It was just this guy

2533
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,160
screaming at Tom's lungs and then like his buddy

2534
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,160
his like hype man, his wingman

2535
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,160
coming up, talking in inaudible

2536
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,160
tones. Trying to like

2537
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,160
desperately trying to come see the fucking

2538
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,160
stupid dinosaurs. They have

2539
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,160
manufactured. That sounds like

2540
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,160
Hawaiian T-Bap right there.

2541
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,160
Oh it does! Ben with this terrible mic quality

2542
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,160
even though we use the same microphone

2543
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,160
for every episode to you at.

2544
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,160
I'm trying to find it right now.

2545
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,160
I forget what it is.

2546
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,160
It's Jurassic something.

2547
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,160
It's not Jurassic Park obviously.

2548
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,160
It's Jurassic

2549
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,160
Landmobile.

2550
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,160
I hope someone else can find it. Anyway,

2551
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,160
the point of that is that I Google search them

2552
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,160
because they had a website.

2553
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,160
And then they have, they're preaching about

2554
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,160
all these fucking sick ass dinosaurs

2555
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,160
that are so realistic.

2556
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,160
It's like a cartoon depiction of a dinosaur.

2557
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,160
It's got like big like bulging eyes

2558
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,160
and it's like fucking little puppet like muppet

2559
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,160
shit. And they're talking about living, breathing

2560
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,160
dinosaurs that can come and see.

2561
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,160
It just is a guy who is like

2562
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:13,160
holding a puppet of a T-Rex looking at

2563
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,160
children right now.

2564
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,160
Alright, so there's a bit of an exaggeration

2565
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,160
there. You know, a bit of an upsell.

2566
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,160
Living, breathing dinosaurs

2567
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,160
here in Maui!

2568
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,160
Can't see this!

2569
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,160
That is it. It was great.

2570
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,160
It was my favorite thing about it.

2571
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,160
Okay, that sounds incredible.

2572
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,160
Moving on everybody.

2573
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,160
Yeah, so here's the deal everybody.

2574
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,160
In case you haven't heard,

2575
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,160
you haven't heard, what is it?

2576
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,160
It's www.speakpipe.com

2577
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,160
slash PCP voicemail.

2578
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,160
We've got the box open

2579
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,160
and in the two days it's been since

2580
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
the last episode we've got a whole

2581
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,160
bunch of voicemails.

2582
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,160
I listened to a few of them before the show

2583
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,160
I listened to a couple as well.

2584
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,160
Now we might need to work out some kinks here

2585
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:01,160
because we have to do some roundabout shit

2586
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,160
to get to play so we can all hear it.

2587
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,160
But you don't give a fuck about that.

2588
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,160
That doesn't matter.

2589
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,160
By the way, if yours isn't played, that means

2590
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,160
you are gay.

2591
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,160
I did not click on these to quality control

2592
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,160
like which are good and which are bad.

2593
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,160
I will be doing that in the future. I just was

2594
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,160
busy with this.

2595
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,160
I figured...

2596
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,160
Indeed. Let's play the very first voicemail

2597
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,160
that we got

2598
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,160
from a little boy

2599
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:29,160
with a big dream named Connor.

2600
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,160
Let's see what he's got for us

2601
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,160
on this edition of PCB voicemail.

2602
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,160
Here we go.

2603
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,160
Look

2604
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,160
I am a three step plan

2605
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,160
for how you guys can make this show so much better.

2606
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,160
What you need to do is you need to

2607
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,160
get five different recordings

2608
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,160
of everyone except

2609
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,160
G.E. saying

2610
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,160
Yeah.

2611
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:53,160
Yeah? Okay.

2612
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,160
And then just

2613
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:57,160
you guys don't have to appear in the episode

2614
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,160
and then we can just have this guy yelling

2615
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,160
at the top of his lungs.

2616
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,160
Sample that for about two minutes

2617
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,160
and then repeat it all and stop.

2618
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,160
And then you've got another episode.

2619
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,160
You guys win. You can just take all the picture

2620
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:11,160
of money without having to do anything.

2621
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,160
That's my two step plan for how to make

2622
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,160
you guys rich quick.

2623
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,160
Sam.

2624
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,160
Okay. First of all, that's how we do the

2625
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,160
PCB AI that we talked about.

2626
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:23,160
We just get recordings of all of us

2627
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,160
nodding in agreement, like the sound effect

2628
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,160
of us moving our heads up and down.

2629
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:29,160
And then we just

2630
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:31,160
we get the words Starfleet how

2631
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,160
and then we just have like

2632
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:35,160
we're played over and over again Starfleet how

2633
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,160
Starfleet how Starfleet Starfleet

2634
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,160
and then we just have that play and then us like

2635
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:41,160
nodding in agreement.

2636
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,160
I just like the idea of like Nate doing a thing

2637
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,160
with his voice like saying Starfleet how

2638
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,160
we'll just talk over it.

2639
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,160
Starfleet how.

2640
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,160
It like ignores us.

2641
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,160
I'm not even opposed to doing this as a bonus episode.

2642
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,160
That would be a great

2643
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,160
that would be a great idea.

2644
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,160
So thanks Connor. Congratulations.

2645
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,160
You're the first ever guy.

2646
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,160
Hey, come

2647
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,160
come back out to Armour Treatment Con 4.

2648
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,160
It's not happening, but just do it

2649
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,160
and then hope it happens.

2650
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,160
Was Connor there? Do you know that guy?

2651
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,160
Connor came to Armour Treatment Con 3.

2652
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,160
He cosplayed as the arm.

2653
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,160
Oh, he was the arm.

2654
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,160
He was cosplaying as the arm and he had the

2655
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,160
Terezi glasses and horns.

2656
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:23,160
He was cool. And now he's a notorious

2657
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,160
Freemason

2658
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,160
in the RFCK

2659
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,160
discord. So I know Connor. Good for him.

2660
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,160
Notorious.

2661
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,160
Alright, let's go on to our next one here. This is from Tep.

2662
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,160
This was the next message. Let's see what we got here.

2663
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,160
Let's see what we got here.

2664
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,160
Oh.

2665
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,160
That was it.

2666
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,160
Very nice.

2667
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,160
Thank you. Appreciate that Tep for that

2668
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,160
lovely belch.

2669
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,160
Okay, let's see what we got.

2670
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,160
Who was that? That was from Tep.

2671
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,160
Hey Tep, I got something for her.

2672
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,160
No.

2673
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,160
No.

2674
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:01,160
Okay, there you go.

2675
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,160
I'll be prepared next time.

2676
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,160
I'll be carbonated and I'll fuck you up.

2677
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,160
Appreciate that.

2678
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,160
I'll throw my headphones out of my ears.

2679
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,160
Let's see what else we got. Here's one from Liam.

2680
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,160
Okay, this one's 19 seconds.

2681
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,160
Let's see what we got here.

2682
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,160
G'day to the PCP.

2683
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,160
This is Liam from the upside down and down under

2684
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,160
that apparently is fake.

2685
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,160
My question to you is,

2686
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,160
we know that mage is the violet violence.

2687
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,160
So what action color

2688
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,160
combination is each other member

2689
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,160
of the PCP?

2690
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:33,160
Oh, that's cool.

2691
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,160
This is a boring question.

2692
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,160
The turquoise terrorists.

2693
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:39,160
Oh, that's a good one.

2694
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,160
I'm the pink passion.

2695
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,160
The pink passion.

2696
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,160
Okay, I'll just be

2697
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,160
the

2698
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,160
the lime green

2699
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,160
lime man.

2700
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,160
Lime green limestone.

2701
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,160
Tom is the bitch bitch.

2702
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,160
He's the blue bitch.

2703
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,160
Tom's the red scare.

2704
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,160
He's the red scare is where he is.

2705
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,160
No, he's the red retard.

2706
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,160
I don't know why you're taking it

2707
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:11,160
in such a negative place.

2708
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:13,160
Muchy, do we need to like

2709
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,160
pass to the guy? Is there a problem here?

2710
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,160
Yeah.

2711
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,160
Check out this black guy I just found.

2712
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:21,160
I'll be the green machine.

2713
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,160
That works. All right, let's see what we got here.

2714
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,160
Oh, that's a good black guy you got right there.

2715
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,160
I like that. That's Ben St.

2716
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,160
He's the black guy.

2717
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,160
The black guy.

2718
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:33,160
Ben St.

2719
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,160
My favorite alliteration.

2720
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,160
I call him the black panther.

2721
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,160
Yeah, that's a good one too.

2722
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,160
The black banther, so it rhymes.

2723
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,160
Let's see.

2724
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,160
Only people who are here get him.

2725
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,160
Also Ben, because I felt like it.

2726
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,160
Nobody else gets them because they're lame.

2727
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,160
What was Ben's?

2728
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,160
Ben's?

2729
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,160
He's the black guy.

2730
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,160
He's the black guy.

2731
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,160
I'll just have everybody know right now,

2732
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,160
Digi is leaving the house immediately.

2733
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:03,160
He could be on the show right now, but he's not.

2734
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,160
He's being a faggot and not participating.

2735
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,160
Well, there you go.

2736
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,160
No nickname for you. Doc is pay forever.

2737
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,160
Yep, we'll do. Doc's is pay.

2738
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,160
Like find out where his payment is.

2739
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,160
Let's get another one here.

2740
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,160
This is from Marky Mark

2741
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,160
and the Funky Bunch.

2742
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,160
Let's see what we got.

2743
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:23,160
Hey, I just want to say

2744
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,160
you should all kill yourselves for doing the PCP theme song thing.

2745
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,160
It sucks.

2746
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,160
And that's it.

2747
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,160
He's saying what we're all thinking.

2748
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,160
Now, I assume he's in the

2749
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,160
the loud camp of naysayers

2750
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,160
who are being like, oh, the second one should have won.

2751
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:45,160
Why didn't that one win?

2752
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,160
Arkans was better than Sasuke's.

2753
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,160
Sasuke will pull a fucking

2754
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,160
Susano Genjutsu on your fucking ass

2755
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,160
and turn your asshole inside out

2756
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,160
in an illusion.

2757
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,160
I haven't listened to the thing yet and Arkans got second.

2758
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
I really wanted

2759
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,160
because I voted for Arkans and

2760
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,160
I wanted what I thought is if he's in the theme

2761
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,160
we should do a channel trailer

2762
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,160
to that.

2763
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,160
It was great.

2764
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,160
We're going to use these for things

2765
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,160
and I think that one will definitely be around.

2766
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,160
We're setting such a bad precedent right now

2767
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,160
playing all of these.

2768
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,160
It's going to be all fucking shit

2769
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,160
and burping and some guy's going to piss

2770
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,160
and be like, hey, Munchie, try me out.

2771
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:25,160
The great news about the way that we're doing it now

2772
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,160
is we can just cut ones we don't

2773
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,160
like or censor things if we need to

2774
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:31,160
or do whatever the fuck we want

2775
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,160
because we don't owe these fucking people anything.

2776
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,160
So it's great.

2777
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:37,160
Now, there was like one or two good ones.

2778
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,160
Okay, here's a good one, Munchie.

2779
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:41,160
You'll be into this. This is from

2780
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,160
Take Down Big Weed

2781
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,160
is this one.

2782
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:47,160
Let's see what we've got here.

2783
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,160
And away we go.

2784
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,160
Hey, big fan of the show here.

2785
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,160
I was just wondering,

2786
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,160
what's your favorite anime?

2787
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,160
Oh!

2788
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,160
Oh!

2789
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,160
Okay.

2790
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,160
Okay.

2791
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,160
Voice actor hired immediately.

2792
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,160
Whoever you are.

2793
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,160
If I ever make

2794
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,160
like a children's television show, you will play

2795
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,160
the main character.

2796
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:17,160
I loved it. I loved every second

2797
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,160
of that clip.

2798
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,160
Thank you. Thank you

2799
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,160
for participating in history.

2800
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,160
You guys said the anime shit

2801
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,160
questions would never pay off

2802
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,160
with a punchline. Well,

2803
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,160
eat your words, friends.

2804
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,160
If you think this is the end of it,

2805
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,160
you have no idea what the fuck you've just bred.

2806
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Now that they know that they can get

2807
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:39,160
on the show and make us laugh by saying

2808
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,160
what's your favorite anime, every

2809
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,160
fucking week we're gonna have some dumb

2810
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,160
ass be like, um, what's

2811
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:47,160
your favorite?

2812
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,160
It's already a week.

2813
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,160
We can cut them.

2814
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:55,160
Or we can just, we can screen them ahead of time

2815
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:57,160
and not play ones that are shit. We can do whatever we want, man.

2816
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,160
Or we can screen at them as they happen.

2817
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,160
Okay, that one was good. But I've got big

2818
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,160
expectations for our boy. Her anime is

2819
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:05,160
Karikano. That's a good one.

2820
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,160
But here's XXX Epic Gamers

2821
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,160
69 420 XXX

2822
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,160
with an epic question

2823
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,160
I've no doubt. What do we got?

2824
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,160
What do we got here?

2825
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:17,160
Hey guys, Epic Gamer here.

2826
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,160
Today, I'm gonna teach you how to become an epic gamer.

2827
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,160
Step one, you need to

2828
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,160
learn the two tenets of gaming.

2829
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:25,160
Number one, abusing women.

2830
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,160
Two.

2831
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,160
Now I have to step two.

2832
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,160
Now you'll want to get your battle

2833
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,160
station swept up.

2834
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,160
So now that you've swept up in the winds

2835
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,160
of capitalism and that you've

2836
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,160
just solved the same.

2837
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,160
As the Lord would want of you to.

2838
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,160
Now on to part three. Getting your games.

2839
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,160
Go to newtaku.com

2840
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,160
for 10% off.

2841
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:49,160
We'll see you later gamers. I'm off to

2842
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,160
jump off the battle bus.

2843
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:53,160
Okay, okay.

2844
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,160
Don't take this the wrong way.

2845
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,160
Any of you guys. This is not an insult

2846
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,160
in any way. But,

2847
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:01,160
the thing that makes these,

2848
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,160
if any of us were to say this,

2849
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,160
it probably would not be as funny as you saying it.

2850
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:07,160
You got your, like the fans,

2851
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:09,160
your mic quality and lack of

2852
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:11,160
like confidence

2853
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,160
on stage.

2854
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,160
Make these extremely funny.

2855
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,160
When you're saying like, you gotta

2856
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,160
beat women and

2857
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:21,160
I love it. It's really funny

2858
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:23,160
and thank you.

2859
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,160
I'm not trying to shame you.

2860
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,160
I'm not trying to make you upset.

2861
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:29,160
I would

2862
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,160
specifically endorse people who have never

2863
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,160
used a microphone before to do this.

2864
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:35,160
I like it. It's so easy.

2865
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,160
It's a great like rick and moody

2866
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,160
improvisational sort of feeling.

2867
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,160
It's just so you know guys. It's so easy

2868
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,160
to do with SpeakPipe. There's a link

2869
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,160
in the description. SpeakPipe.com

2870
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:47,160
slash PCP voicemail. Do it now.

2871
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,160
Go just record and be

2872
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,160
a funny boy and get

2873
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:53,160
your voice heard because it's funny

2874
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:55,160
shit and I like it.

2875
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,160
People who screen this don't like it.

2876
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:59,160
Well, yeah, fair enough.

2877
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,160
I mean, you know, that's why we'll screen them or whatever.

2878
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:03,160
Alright, let's do like one or two more. Here's a

2879
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,160
philosopher king almond milk

2880
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:07,160
has left one.

2881
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:09,160
This is like a minute. Alright, let's see what we got here.

2882
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,160
You know what

2883
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:15,160
fucking pisses me off

2884
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:17,160
through common rules

2885
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,160
when Nate and Jesse

2886
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,160
objectively fucking

2887
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,160
destroys did you stupid opinion

2888
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,160
about renounciations when he says

2889
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,160
it feels like a little child he's screaming

2890
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,160
and then he screams

2891
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,160
and the objectivity isn't real.

2892
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,160
I like this guy. He's got a sound thing.

2893
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:35,160
He's got objectivism.

2894
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,160
He's got a fucking

2895
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,160
topic.

2896
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,160
He's got an objectivist

2897
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:43,160
with relatively unpinning.

2898
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,160
Or because a relativist cuck

2899
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:47,160
has an objective statement as a cunt

2900
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,160
in a debate

2901
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:51,160
because all they say is

2902
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,160
it's all subjective. Fuck off

2903
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,160
and get raped you stupid motherfucker.

2904
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:57,160
How the fuck can you

2905
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,160
get raped in our objective

2906
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,160
statement

2907
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:03,160
by disregarding objectivism.

2908
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,160
It just doesn't fucking work.

2909
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,160
You think one of the rules

2910
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,160
of objectivism

2911
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:11,160
but you...

2912
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,160
Alright.

2913
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,160
Okay. Whoa, this guy

2914
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,160
just slain.

2915
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,160
There's so much about pronouncing words

2916
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:21,160
he just can't help it.

2917
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,160
Don't get me wrong, this man is objectively correct

2918
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,160
about being mad at didgy for fucking

2919
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:27,160
the pronunciation of words.

2920
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:29,160
But more than that, what he's really doing

2921
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,160
is recoiling to didgy's cuck

2922
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,160
mentality of relativism

2923
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,160
and while it's true

2924
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,160
there's many things that we cannot prove are real.

2925
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,160
Just be like, oh my god.

2926
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,160
Okay, didgy's point has always been

2927
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,160
terrible about pronouncing. Like, I want to

2928
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,160
pronounce words this way, therefore

2929
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,160
I can do whatever I want because language is just a social construct.

2930
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:49,160
Like, okay.

2931
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,160
But...

2932
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:53,160
We live in a society.

2933
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,160
In a society.

2934
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,160
Not if you live in a tree.

2935
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:59,160
If you go to a tree,

2936
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,160
stay there for a very long time.

2937
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,160
You won't have to speak words at all.

2938
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,160
They won't get it.

2939
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,160
Oh.

2940
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:09,160
The sole point of a language is

2941
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:11,160
so people can communicate.

2942
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,160
So there are standards that we use.

2943
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:15,160
I know that.

2944
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,160
Guys, you're not gonna fucking believe this.

2945
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,160
Okay, what's up?

2946
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:21,160
You're not gonna believe this.

2947
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,160
Who called the Pokemon?

2948
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:25,160
Oh no, I'm not gonna tell you what the Pokemon is.

2949
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,160
I'm gonna see if you can see it.

2950
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,160
Kinkillian.

2951
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:31,160
Can you pronounce a Pokemon's name?

2952
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:33,160
Kinkillian.

2953
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,160
Kingler? What Pokemon do you think he's referring to?

2954
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:37,160
Was it Kingler?

2955
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:39,160
No. Kecleon?

2956
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,160
Yes, Kecleon. It was Kecleon.

2957
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,160
What? Why?

2958
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,160
That doesn't make any sense.

2959
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:47,160
The word is not written that way.

2960
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,160
This is what didgy is arguing for right now.

2961
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:51,160
Isn't it because it's like

2962
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,160
chameleon?

2963
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:55,160
That's exact justification.

2964
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,160
Wait.

2965
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,160
How terrible.

2966
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,160
I can see that actually.

2967
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,160
Kinkillian and Kecleon.

2968
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,160
You know what?

2969
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,160
I have not looked into it. Okay, tell you what.

2970
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,160
Let's just do one more.

2971
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,160
There's this one about a guy traveling Japan

2972
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,160
that I already listened to.

2973
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,160
I'm gonna try to find it.

2974
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:17,160
Play this one in the meantime.

2975
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,160
Let me see where the fuck did it go.

2976
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,160
Okay, this one is from

2977
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,160
Sorry, I already played that. OneSpar.

2978
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,160
This is one from OneSpar.

2979
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,160
Who's an old fogey.

2980
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,160
An old codger around these parts.

2981
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,160
I can actually beat this.

2982
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:33,160
Okay, let's find out.

2983
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:35,160
Hello, Procrastinators. This is OneSpar

2984
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,160
of OneSpar Weekly.

2985
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:39,160
My favorite program.

2986
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:41,160
I think that you guys could be giving

2987
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,160
more of a spotlight on the podcast

2988
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:45,160
to

2989
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:47,160
fan highlights

2990
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,160
and fan animation videos

2991
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:51,160
of the Procrastinators podcast.

2992
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,160
Fan animations?

2993
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,160
I've seen definitely a few

2994
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:57,160
really great ones and

2995
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,160
I think they deserve an honorable mention at least.

2996
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,160
Of course,

2997
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,160
none was standing. I've made my own highlights

2998
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,160
and I plan to make more in the future

2999
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,160
and it would be great to hear your guys'

3000
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:09,160
opinions on some of the ones that exist

3001
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,160
and where they're good and where they're

3002
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,160
not so good.

3003
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,160
Anyway, that's my call.

3004
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:17,160
That's why I did it

3005
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,160
and now I'm done.

3006
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:21,160
It's over.

3007
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:23,160
Goodbye.

3008
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,160
He was really polite.

3009
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:27,160
I like him.

3010
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,160
OneSpar's a good lad.

3011
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,160
I think he had made some of the PCB

3012
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:33,160
highlights that I put onto

3013
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:35,160
the PCB Highlights Channel

3014
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:37,160
which I made a while back.

3015
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:39,160
I think a lot of people know that it exists by the way.

3016
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,160
I made a PCB Highlights Channel

3017
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:43,160
back and I was going to do more with it.

3018
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:45,160
It simply became apparent that

3019
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,160
it took effort to do this

3020
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:49,160
and arrange this and I was already spending too much

3021
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,160
time working on PCB stuff

3022
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,160
as is. The channel exists.

3023
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:55,160
There's a couple highlights on there. I always meant

3024
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,160
to put more. People have produced more and

3025
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,160
there's a thing in the Patreon and Discord.

3026
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:01,160
I think it's called the PCB Highlights

3027
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,160
Chat where I ask people to give us

3028
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:05,160
good things to do.

3029
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:07,160
Give us cool segments to clip and turn

3030
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:09,160
into a highlight because I do think that's actually

3031
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,160
a very good idea to grow the show

3032
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,160
and get more people to watch and stuff.

3033
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:15,160
It simply is a matter of

3034
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,160
it takes effort to do that

3035
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:19,160
and I'm already

3036
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:21,160
fucking pressed for time.

3037
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,160
I want to find a solution. We talked about

3038
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,160
possibly paying people for doing it

3039
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:27,160
but I don't know.

3040
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,160
I'm not really sure what the best way

3041
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:31,160
to handle it is. To highlight them

3042
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,160
on the show, to show

3043
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,160
fan art we decided not to do that

3044
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:37,160
because it's a visual thing.

3045
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:39,160
That seems reasonable. But how exactly

3046
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,160
would we show highlights on the show?

3047
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,160
I don't think that makes much sense.

3048
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,160
I think he is just

3049
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:47,160
talking about shouting out the fact that

3050
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:49,160
the highlights exist.

3051
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,160
I think what would be the best plan would be

3052
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,160
to work with people who want to do them

3053
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:55,160
whatever. Maybe do the re-uploads

3054
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:57,160
of people's highlight stuff

3055
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:59,160
onto the PCB Highlights. Of course give them

3056
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:01,160
as much credit as they

3057
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:03,160
want. All that shit. And then

3058
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,160
shout that out more in

3059
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:07,160
main episodes here. I think that would probably

3060
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:09,160
be the best thing to do. I think that's a good call.

3061
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:11,160
Yeah. It's just a question of

3062
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,160
I did that stuff. I started it

3063
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:15,160
I didn't do much and I always

3064
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:17,160
wanted to do more. And ideally if I had infinite

3065
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:19,160
time I would. I just don't...

3066
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,160
Oh he did so many highlights.

3067
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:23,160
Yeah he did.

3068
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,160
He's fucking done a bunch of them. So

3069
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:27,160
here's a quick shout out to celebrate the more

3070
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:29,160
Oncebar. Go check out his channel

3071
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,160
on YouTube. Oncebar weekly. He's done a bunch of cool shit.

3072
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:33,160
There you go.

3073
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,160
We should listen to One More by

3074
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,160
Jamie. I don't know if you have that

3075
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:39,160
download. But I listened to

3076
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:41,160
Jamie's beforehand. I liked it. And I think

3077
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,160
it's important that we have it in the show.

3078
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:45,160
Jamie. Yeah. I have it right here. Okay.

3079
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:47,160
Let's give it a listen. Hang on.

3080
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,160
Hang on. Over here.

3081
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,160
Okay. This is like a real one.

3082
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:53,160
A real one. All those ones were bullshit

3083
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,160
up to this point. Let's hear the real one.

3084
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:57,160
Real ones recognize real ones. Here we go.

3085
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:01,160
Hey guys. How's it going? Big fan here.

3086
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:03,160
We've got a request for help, which is

3087
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:05,160
that I'm going to Japan in like two weeks

3088
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,160
and we'll be spending a week or so in Tokyo

3089
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:09,160
and don't want to just get stuck

3090
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:11,160
visiting gay ass tourist tracks

3091
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:13,160
the whole time. So if any of you

3092
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,160
have been, and I know Nate definitely has,

3093
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:17,160
where are the cool places?

3094
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,160
And how do I get

3095
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,160
to them? And as a side question

3096
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:23,160
what cool food should I

3097
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,160
eat that I can't get in the west?

3098
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:27,160
Excellent question. Also Munchie is right and the

3099
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:29,160
old theme should stay as the outro.

3100
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:31,160
Thanks.

3101
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,160
I don't even really oppose

3102
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,160
that as being used for the outro.

3103
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,160
But we'll, I don't know, I guess you'll find

3104
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,160
out when you get to the end of this episode

3105
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,160
how that's been resolved. Won't you, fair listener?

3106
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:45,160
Okay. So you're going to Japan.

3107
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:47,160
Here's tip number one.

3108
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:49,160
This is for everyone, regardless

3109
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,160
of where they're going, you, anyone.

3110
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:53,160
Whenever you want to eat

3111
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:55,160
food, ask

3112
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,160
your hotel manager, or better yet

3113
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:59,160
your cab guys. It's a good idea. Someone

3114
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:01,160
who lives there, ask them where

3115
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,160
to eat. Say,

3116
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:05,160
Sumimosenkabisan

3117
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:07,160
Doko tabimasuka

3118
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,160
give them one of those

3119
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,160
and they'll say, you know,

3120
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:13,160
Hey, since then, give me a asshole

3121
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,160
bug. I can't believe I ever

3122
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:17,160
said what Nate said, despite the horrible

3123
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:19,160
accident.

3124
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,160
Oh, you understood it? Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was

3125
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:23,160
actually a relatively correct way to

3126
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:25,160
say something. It's just like, it's

3127
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:27,160
a very, very kind of way of saying it.

3128
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,160
Well, yeah. So

3129
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:31,160
Munchie's a way better like travel guy. He

3130
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,160
knows about doing cool things. Okay, okay.

3131
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:35,160
TripAdvisor is

3132
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:37,160
ironically a lifesaver. You got to know how

3133
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,160
to use TripAdvisor. What is TripAdvisor?

3134
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,160
Is it a website? No, it's

3135
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,160
it. Well, yes, it is an app as well, though.

3136
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,160
Oh, it's an app. Okay, okay.

3137
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:47,160
You can sort things, like TripAdvisor

3138
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:49,160
people are mostly based,

3139
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,160
like they mostly, when you

3140
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:53,160
go to Google or something, you're going to have

3141
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:55,160
you know, like crack heads

3142
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:57,160
and fucking, you know, Johnny Depp

3143
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:59,160
and shit like that. You don't know what, who's

3144
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,160
going to tell you what. So when you go on TripAdvisor

3145
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:03,160
they are mostly people who care about

3146
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:05,160
traveling and, you know, want to actually give

3147
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,160
accurate information in my experience

3148
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:09,160
going to Rome and Hawaii and stuff like

3149
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,160
that. So using TripAdvisor

3150
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:13,160
you are going to want to use that as sort

3151
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:15,160
of like a baseline. If you just

3152
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:17,160
have no one that you can turn to a local

3153
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,160
to ask for directions or anything like that,

3154
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:21,160
you're going to use TripAdvisor as a sort of

3155
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:23,160
backup so you can have, you understand what's

3156
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:25,160
going on in your life and you have some big idea

3157
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:27,160
of what to do. But honestly, you should ask the

3158
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,160
people in Japan, because I've not been to Japan

3159
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:31,160
I'm sure Nate can tell you a little bit of cool stuff

3160
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:33,160
but really you should be asking the people

3161
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,160
who are actually living there

3162
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:37,160
and have similar interest to you. I mean

3163
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,160
it depends on what kind of trip you want to

3164
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:41,160
have. I can't

3165
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,160
really know if it's like an Eiffel Tower

3166
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,160
or anything like that.

3167
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,160
Fucking Tokyo Tower. Go to Tokyo Tower.

3168
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,160
It's like, it's kind of, it's modeled after the Eiffel Tower

3169
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:51,160
I don't know if you want to go, I don't know if you want

3170
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:53,160
to go see monuments like that or if you just want

3171
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:55,160
to have a good time in a foreign country

3172
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:57,160
and learn what it's like.

3173
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,160
Restaurants, the most important thing

3174
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,160
in your fucking trip is eating good food.

3175
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,160
That is the most important thing

3176
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,160
in going to any country is eating

3177
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:07,160
the food and the real food that they eat

3178
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:09,160
as well. You don't want to eat fucking hamburgers

3179
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,160
while you're in Japan. You want to be eating

3180
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:13,160
ramen or fucking, you know, whatever

3181
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:15,160
the hell they eat in that fucking fermented

3182
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:17,160
shark, Johnny Depp, shit like that.

3183
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:19,160
So you want to go there and you want to have

3184
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:21,160
some fried debt and that's what you want to do.

3185
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,160
Have ramen because they're like ramen.

3186
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:25,160
So find out what good restaurants

3187
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:27,160
there and Nate you probably know more specifically

3188
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,160
about Japan. I mean, yeah, yeah,

3189
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:31,160
I can give you some of the

3190
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,160
some of the good shit.

3191
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:35,160
I mean, you got to go to, you're going to enjoy

3192
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,160
I think just hitting up

3193
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:39,160
there's like what's called like the 404

3194
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:41,160
Square or something. You're going to want to go

3195
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:43,160
to downtown Tokyo and just walk around

3196
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:45,160
because there's dope shit. It's really cool. It just

3197
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:47,160
looks really nice. Go into some shops.

3198
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:49,160
Go to Uniqlo. They got they got good

3199
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:51,160
shit around there. You're going to want to go to

3200
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:53,160
Akihabara. Give yourself

3201
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:55,160
like a day or two or three

3202
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,160
of your trip I would do to

3203
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:59,160
simply go to Akihabara and walk around

3204
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,160
because it is gigantic and here's something important

3205
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,160
you got to know about Japan.

3206
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,160
A lot of the cool shit

3207
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,160
has like small signs out

3208
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:09,160
front and like there's

3209
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:11,160
like small passageways like get back into

3210
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,160
buildings that like host like

3211
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,160
20 different businesses in it. And then

3212
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:17,160
only once you get inside do you see how

3213
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,160
there's so much dope shit hiding

3214
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:21,160
like behind the

3215
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:23,160
storefront or whatever that has like other

3216
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:25,160
advertisements or whatever. So I would say

3217
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:27,160
do some research and find out cool

3218
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,160
things you might want to go to. You should check out

3219
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:31,160
Super Bunny Hop just made a video on like the

3220
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:33,160
like the game

3221
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:35,160
what was it? It's like

3222
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:37,160
video game bars basically in Japan

3223
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:39,160
and how they're having tough times. That's just

3224
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:41,160
a quick video to watch that's educational

3225
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:43,160
about the nature of this stuff. I check that out

3226
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,160
because that's helpful and interesting.

3227
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:47,160
One thing you definitely

3228
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,160
should do is learn a little

3229
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,160
bit of the history before you go there. On the plane

3230
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:53,160
right it doesn't take a lot of time. You don't have

3231
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:55,160
to go get a fucking history book or something

3232
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:57,160
you can just do simple some fucking like

3233
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,160
extra credits or some baby shit like that

3234
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,160
just learn a little bit of the history of Japan

3235
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:03,160
where you're going, where you're staying

3236
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:05,160
because learning about the country

3237
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:07,160
in which you are happening is probably the most

3238
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,160
important thing you can do. I mean that's the reason

3239
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:11,160
you're going. No, no, no. Throw that in the trash

3240
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:13,160
that doesn't matter. You've seen anime

3241
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,160
you know everything you need to know about Japan.

3242
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,160
I forgot, I forgot. Yeah, that's right.

3243
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,160
But just, I don't know

3244
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:21,160
what it's really like in Asian countries

3245
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:23,160
I've never been there but if they have

3246
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,160
equivalent to like European style monuments

3247
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:27,160
and stuff, read all the monuments.

3248
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,160
Shinto shrines. Check out some Shinto shrines.

3249
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,160
Yeah, check out Shinto shrines.

3250
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:35,160
Catch a farfetched

3251
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:37,160
and trade it to me. Don't forget to do that.

3252
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,160
Okay, okay, okay. Real fucking talk

3253
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:41,160
Jamie. Real fucking talk.

3254
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:43,160
I have got a Mr. Mime and a Corsola

3255
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,160
with your name on it

3256
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,160
if you give me a farfetched.

3257
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,160
You can have a fucking Corsola from Hawaii

3258
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:51,160
from me.

3259
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,160
Your god king if you give me a farfetched.

3260
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,160
Hang on, hang on. Are you saying our Corsola

3261
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,160
is exclusive to Hawaii or something?

3262
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:59,160
No, they're exclusive to the equator.

3263
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:01,160
Oh.

3264
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,160
Oh fuck. I didn't know about that. God damn it

3265
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,160
I would have caught one if I'd known.

3266
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,160
Hey, hey, I can give you one for a price.

3267
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:09,160
Oh, no.

3268
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:11,160
I've never heard of a blow job, Nate.

3269
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:13,160
Because you might need it.

3270
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:15,160
He's pretty familiar with that.

3271
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:17,160
Here I go again.

3272
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,160
You wind up in jail.

3273
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:21,160
Anyway, Jamie,

3274
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,160
I wish you all the best. Learn about Japan.

3275
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,160
Understand it. Ask the locals.

3276
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:27,160
And don't be afraid

3277
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,160
to go on a tour, but do know

3278
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,160
that you should be picking tours pretty smartly.

3279
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,160
It's kind of hard to know what tours to go on

3280
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,160
when you're already out traveling.

3281
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,160
But don't go on tours that are too restrictive.

3282
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:39,160
Don't go to

3283
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,160
a general Tokyo tour

3284
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,160
because you might not see.

3285
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,160
Just go to pretty specific things.

3286
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,160
Focus tours. Focus tours are good.

3287
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:49,160
And just learn

3288
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:51,160
as much as you can while you're there.

3289
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:53,160
Learn about the culture, learn about the people,

3290
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:55,160
learn about the history, and that's what you should do.

3291
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:57,160
Here's just some tangible things to keep in mind.

3292
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:59,160
Just rapid fire. Here's what you do.

3293
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,160
Go to Don Quixote in Akihabara.

3294
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:03,160
You're famous. You're going to want to tell your friends

3295
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:05,160
you've been to Don Quixote in Akihabara.

3296
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:07,160
It's cool. Go to

3297
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:09,160
a made cafe.

3298
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:11,160
I regret not going. Go to a made cafe

3299
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:13,160
and enjoy the experience

3300
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:15,160
and you will be a true anime boy.

3301
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:17,160
Just do it. Don't push the out like I did.

3302
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:19,160
I like to go to a cat cafe.

3303
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,160
Go to a cat cafe.

3304
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:23,160
They got those. Those are cool.

3305
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:25,160
You're going to want to... Okay. I don't know how old you are.

3306
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:27,160
I don't know what your deal is.

3307
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,160
I don't know if you're going with family or friends

3308
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:31,160
but that changes the whole experience.

3309
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:33,160
It absolutely does.

3310
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:35,160
I had some of my best times in Japan

3311
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:37,160
at like 5 a.m.

3312
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:39,160
at Roppongi, which is the red light district

3313
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:41,160
like the club areas.

3314
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:43,160
Go there. Get wasted

3315
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:45,160
and

3316
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,160
go to Gas Panic.

3317
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:49,160
If that club still exists. That was a dope place.

3318
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,160
Tell them Nate Bestman sent you

3319
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:53,160
and they'll let you into the VIP lounge.

3320
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,160
That's a lie. That will not work.

3321
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:57,160
Oh, best guy ever.

3322
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,160
Oh!

3323
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:01,160
America Jean.

3324
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:03,160
I just checked it right now

3325
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:05,160
but I will tell you

3326
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,160
about a company.

3327
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:09,160
This is free advertising.

3328
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,160
Please unironically sponsor us

3329
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:13,160
the company Secret Food Tours.

3330
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:15,160
Oh, that sounds good.

3331
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,160
The best fucking time I had in Rome.

3332
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:19,160
The highlight of this trip

3333
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:21,160
not a joke

3334
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,160
was this tour by fucking

3335
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,160
Secret Food Tours.

3336
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:27,160
They do not have one for Tokyo.

3337
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:29,160
They have stuff like Hong Kong

3338
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,160
but America on there.

3339
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:33,160
Not just you, but anyone who's traveling soon.

3340
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:35,160
Search for Secret Food Tours

3341
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:37,160
and see if they have one in the place that you're going to.

3342
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:39,160
Because it was fantastic.

3343
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:41,160
You go around

3344
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,160
to local ass

3345
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,160
real restaurants that locals go to every day.

3346
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:47,160
It was fucking delicious.

3347
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:49,160
You could have little samplers across the entirety

3348
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:51,160
of Rome in my instance.

3349
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,160
You just walked around Rome.

3350
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:55,160
Your tour guide

3351
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,160
tells you about daily life in Rome.

3352
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:59,160
What it's like to live there.

3353
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,160
The history of what everything is like.

3354
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:03,160
I learned about how in Rome

3355
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:05,160
there's these weird

3356
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:07,160
fountains that are everywhere

3357
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:09,160
that are constantly dispensing water.

3358
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:11,160
They're just wasting tons of water.

3359
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:13,160
They talked about how the government

3360
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:15,160
is too fucking lazy to clog

3361
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:17,160
the water pipes.

3362
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,160
They called them big noses.

3363
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:21,160
I learned a little quirky little shit about there

3364
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:23,160
in Rome in the city.

3365
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:25,160
I learned a lot of history. It was great.

3366
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,160
Secret food tours, good shit.

3367
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:29,160
When it comes to food, let me just say three things.

3368
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,160
One, go to Yoshinoya.

3369
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:33,160
Yoshinoya is the McDonald's of Japan.

3370
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:35,160
So it's worth going to.

3371
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,160
And it is simply an unagi

3372
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,160
which is an eel on rice, like bowl.

3373
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,160
Their motto is like

3374
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:43,160
fast, quick, and cheap.

3375
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,160
You slap down one fucking hundred yen coin.

3376
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,160
You got yourself a delicious bowl

3377
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:49,160
of rice and eel with sauce and shit.

3378
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:51,160
You'll see all the cool businessmen,

3379
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:53,160
all the Japanese business boys

3380
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,160
having that shit for lunch. It takes them like five minutes.

3381
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:57,160
They got their little tea dispensers.

3382
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:59,160
Go to Yoshinoya. It's dope.

3383
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:01,160
Go to a McDonald's.

3384
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:03,160
Experience Japanese McDonald's.

3385
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:05,160
Highly recommended. It is

3386
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:07,160
a thousand times better. The people are pretty.

3387
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:09,160
The people are professional. They are clean.

3388
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:11,160
It's a world different.

3389
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,160
They've got unique, special, just Japan

3390
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:15,160
items on the menu. Go there. You won't regret it.

3391
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:17,160
It's like a fancy restaurant in Japan.

3392
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:19,160
And final point is that I just agree

3393
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:21,160
with Monchi completely.

3394
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:23,160
One of the most striking memories I have of Japan

3395
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:25,160
was just when I stumbled.

3396
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:27,160
I was just like, I'm hungry.

3397
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,160
Turn to the left. See a random curry

3398
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,160
shop where you just walk into.

3399
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:33,160
Got like the best curry of my life

3400
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,160
in this random, absolute, no idea

3401
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:37,160
how I could ever find it ever again

3402
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,160
curry place. Let yourself be free

3403
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,160
and experience things like that.

3404
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:43,160
For a close food boy.

3405
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:45,160
I don't know about.

3406
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,160
What can I say? I'm still, I'm not perfect.

3407
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:49,160
I'm not a perfect person yet. When I replace my brain

3408
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:51,160
with cybernetics. Food is culture.

3409
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:53,160
Food is culture.

3410
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:55,160
I like your food. What were you saying though?

3411
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:59,160
I don't know about you, but like

3412
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:01,160
if somebody said

3413
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,160
all that to me

3414
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:05,160
when I was asking, what do I do in Japan?

3415
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:07,160
I would get overwhelmed with the amount of stuff

3416
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:09,160
and I would end up not doing anything.

3417
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:11,160
Well, that's his problem.

3418
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,160
I think it's that hard.

3419
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:15,160
I don't know the words, but what did we

3420
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:17,160
actually just say? Go on TripAdvisor

3421
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,160
and ask your family what to do.

3422
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:21,160
Look, Akihabara, Gas Panic, Don Quixote

3423
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,160
various game shops, Made Cafe

3424
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:25,160
Shinto Shrine.

3425
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,160
If you do those, you'll have a great time in Japan.

3426
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:29,160
Do those locals do and learn the culture?

3427
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,160
That's all I'm saying.

3428
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:33,160
No, I'm just saying like

3429
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:35,160
I don't know who else feels this way,

3430
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
but I feel sometimes a lot of pressure

3431
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,160
to experience things while I'm at a place

3432
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:41,160
and it ends up stressing me out.

3433
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,160
You don't have to experience anything.

3434
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:45,160
You could just go to Japan

3435
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,160
and go to McDonald's every day.

3436
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,160
I mean, you say it's different, but you know,

3437
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:51,160
it is McDonald's.

3438
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,160
You don't have something familiar

3439
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:55,160
and you could do that in Japan and it would still be different

3440
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:57,160
because you're in a foreign country.

3441
02:13:57,160 --> 02:13:59,160
You don't have to do the major sites or anything.

3442
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:01,160
This is your vacation, assumably.

3443
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,160
You're an adult and you're going for fun.

3444
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:05,160
Let's be with your family and you are fucked.

3445
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:07,160
I'm sorry, but you will have a terrible time.

3446
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:09,160
It's inevitable that the food is quite different though,

3447
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:11,160
but I wouldn't worry too much about it

3448
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:13,160
because you'll encounter tons of crazy things.

3449
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:15,160
I'm saying is that you don't have to try too hard

3450
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:17,160
to have a different experience in Japan.

3451
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:19,160
You don't have to feel pressured to see everything.

3452
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,160
Just do what you want to do

3453
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:23,160
and I assume what you want to do is have fun

3454
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:25,160
and then we're telling you how to have fun.

3455
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:27,160
Yeah.

3456
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,160
Well guys, that's enough of those for one day.

3457
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:31,160
Let's grab a couple of questions real quick.

3458
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:33,160
I see one question.

3459
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,160
Here's Jamie. Here, can you do one thing for me?

3460
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,160
Go to Japan and don't come back. How about that?

3461
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,160
How is he going to bring you that farfetched

3462
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:41,160
if he doesn't come back?

3463
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,160
Please come back.

3464
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,160
Please.

3465
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:47,160
All right. Who wants to go check out

3466
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:49,160
the old lounge there with the questions, everybody?

3467
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:51,160
Go pick something out while I grab

3468
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:53,160
a little pity question here from the Twitter.

3469
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,160
I have a question. I have a question.

3470
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:57,160
It's from Oncebar, actually.

3471
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:59,160
Let me just say don't forget, everybody, follow us

3472
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:01,160
at tpcrasnators for these announcements on Sunday

3473
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:03,160
when we record and send a question with hashtag

3474
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:05,160
askpcp. All right, Mage, what do you get?

3475
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:07,160
Oncebar's political parquet

3476
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:09,160
at Hippo and Mage.

3477
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:11,160
What are politics like in England and Lithuania

3478
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:13,160
right now? Do you guys even into that stuff?

3479
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:15,160
To answer my part of the question.

3480
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:17,160
I'm really not into it.

3481
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:19,160
The last I know of Lithuanian politics

3482
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:21,160
is that we have a female

3483
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:23,160
president and she's been

3484
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:25,160
a president for like 10 years, I think,

3485
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:27,160
now, 9 to 10 years.

3486
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:29,160
I think she's the first president to get

3487
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,160
re-elected as old in Lithuania.

3488
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:33,160
So yeah, not only the first female,

3489
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:35,160
but the first to get re-elected.

3490
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:37,160
So go

3491
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:39,160
her, I guess.

3492
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:41,160
Yeah, good for her.

3493
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:43,160
We, in England, we have a female

3494
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:45,160
prime minister and she is

3495
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:47,160
Oh my god, the women's are taking over.

3496
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:49,160
She is like

3497
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:51,160
the worst thing of all time

3498
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,160
and I hope that she falls down the stairs

3499
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,160
and somebody films it

3500
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:57,160
and turns it into a very funny game.

3501
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:59,160
Damn.

3502
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:01,160
I generally don't care about politics

3503
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:03,160
but what little I know is that

3504
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:05,160
we suck at the moment.

3505
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:07,160
We're in a fucking mess.

3506
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:09,160
Brexit was a mistake and everybody's an idiot

3507
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:11,160
and I don't trust anyone.

3508
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,160
Well, fair enough. Except maybe Jeremy Corbyn

3509
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:15,160
but I don't know enough about him

3510
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:17,160
necessarily.

3511
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:19,160
Oh man, look at some of these questions.

3512
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:21,160
Some of them are too real.

3513
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,160
What do you think about socialism, guys?

3514
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:25,160
What do you think about redistribution?

3515
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:27,160
Oh god, no, stop.

3516
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:29,160
It's not a politics show.

3517
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:31,160
It's not a politics show, guys.

3518
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:33,160
What do we got here?

3519
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:35,160
Okay, here's a little question.

3520
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:37,160
This is just a general one, whatever.

3521
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:39,160
At Alien Observer asks,

3522
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:41,160
we don't need to go into this too much, but

3523
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,160
if PCB HQ becomes a thing,

3524
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,160
what do you see actually changing

3525
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,160
in each of your content?

3526
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:49,160
What new things can you not make now

3527
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
that you would be able to make then?

3528
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,160
I'll tell you one thing.

3529
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:55,160
Every show that I have, I would get immensely better.

3530
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:57,160
Ethan's editing right now.

3531
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:59,160
What's he working on right now?

3532
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:01,160
Stealing your dad.

3533
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:03,160
Stealing your dad episodes.

3534
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,160
And they are infinitely better

3535
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,160
than just the pure audio show.

3536
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,160
They are fucking incredible.

3537
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,160
We're in our own house.

3538
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:13,160
We're not in public.

3539
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:15,160
We're allowed to say the swear words

3540
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:17,160
really loudly.

3541
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:19,160
It's great. It's fantastic.

3542
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,160
They were great. Hippo was there.

3543
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:23,160
Hippo, I can imagine, was scared

3544
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:25,160
during the recording of his episode.

3545
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:27,160
No, no, no, I like it.

3546
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:29,160
It was fucking funny.

3547
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:31,160
I enjoyed the leftover pizza.

3548
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,160
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3549
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,160
Okay, spoiler alert.

3550
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:37,160
We had a pizza place for the second episode.

3551
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:39,160
And we left the pizza

3552
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:41,160
open in the basement overnight.

3553
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:43,160
Like the rags of pizza.

3554
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,160
These like shreds.

3555
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,160
There's like a couple pieces across.

3556
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,160
I go there and spoiler alert.

3557
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:51,160
I like crushed the pizza with my hands.

3558
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:53,160
Completely obliterated.

3559
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:55,160
It's over. This pizza is non-edible.

3560
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:57,160
Overnight, it stays.

3561
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,160
It rots there. This is in a fucking basement.

3562
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:01,160
I'm sure there's bugs and shit.

3563
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,160
Ben comes at night.

3564
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,160
Ben comes at night the next day.

3565
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,160
And I was like, ooh, pizza.

3566
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:09,160
Don't mind if I do.

3567
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,160
It was me, Ben and Nate.

3568
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:13,160
And none of us knew.

3569
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:15,160
Because none of us were there.

3570
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:17,160
So we all had a bit.

3571
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,160
It was in fucking pieces.

3572
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,160
These were not pieces of pizza.

3573
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:23,160
These were like...

3574
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:25,160
I can't wait for you all to watch this episode

3575
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:27,160
and see what you consumed.

3576
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:29,160
I had a bit of the crust.

3577
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,160
It was nice.

3578
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:33,160
Maybe it's not too late.

3579
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,160
Ethan, if you could edit in

3580
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:37,160
the fact that we ate this pizza

3581
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,160
after whatever is done to it.

3582
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:41,160
People consumed this pizza later.

3583
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,160
That footage is in the

3584
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:45,160
behind-the-scenes red color stuff.

3585
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,160
Oh, it is?

3586
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:49,160
Of us finding the pizza.

3587
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:51,160
Oh man, that'd be pretty good.

3588
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:53,160
Okay, well whatever.

3589
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:55,160
Enough spoilers for stealing your dad.

3590
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:57,160
Anyway, I don't know.

3591
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,160
There's all kinds of stuff we can do

3592
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:01,160
when PCBHQ becomes a thing.

3593
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:03,160
I mean, you wouldn't be part of

3594
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,160
the change of the content

3595
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,160
since you're not there, that's true.

3596
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:09,160
Nor would anyone else who isn't physically present.

3597
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:11,160
But if, for example,

3598
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:13,160
the PCP became a show

3599
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:15,160
that had a video component

3600
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:17,160
and then we could have people call in

3601
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:19,160
a major set, like it's certainly possible to do still.

3602
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:21,160
So, you know, could be

3603
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:23,160
a visual aspect to it. I would be able to do skits.

3604
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:25,160
I want to do skits so bad.

3605
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,160
They're my one passion in life. I want to do them so bad.

3606
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,160
I want someone to write a script

3607
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:31,160
and I'll be able to be their autonym on

3608
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,160
and read a script for them.

3609
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:35,160
Yeah, I want to set up a big,

3610
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,160
actual, proper green screen

3611
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,160
and do full-body green screen stuff.

3612
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:41,160
I stand with a green screen suit on

3613
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:43,160
in front of my green screen.

3614
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:45,160
I get so many shenanigans.

3615
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:47,160
I mean, I'm already doing some stuff with Digi

3616
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:49,160
since I'm here.

3617
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,160
IM Games has a marriage since then.

3618
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:53,160
Which is fucking dope.

3619
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,160
And once he's done with this gay month of making videos every day

3620
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:57,160
I guess I'm fucking try hard bitch.

3621
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,160
He's almost done. He's almost done.

3622
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,160
Yeah, he's almost done.

3623
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:03,160
Then we're going to do IM Games pretty hard.

3624
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:05,160
It's going to be sick.

3625
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:07,160
And yeah, that's going to be dope.

3626
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:09,160
I went to the...

3627
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:11,160
Everyone, I encourage you to do this.

3628
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:13,160
Go to the IM Games YouTube channel.

3629
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:15,160
YouTube channel with zero content

3630
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:17,160
and like several hundred,

3631
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:19,160
maybe thousand now subscribers.

3632
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:21,160
And I went to the...

3633
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:23,160
I would go to the discussion tab and post your feelings,

3634
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:25,160
your strong feelings on IM Games.

3635
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:27,160
I put the words

3636
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,160
put me in the screen cap

3637
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,160
on the top of the discussion board.

3638
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,160
And I encourage everyone else to tell them

3639
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:35,160
how it's your favorite YouTube channel with zero content.

3640
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:37,160
Yes.

3641
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,160
The shirts are selling like fucking hotcakes.

3642
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:41,160
They are.

3643
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:43,160
You got to get on that shit.

3644
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:45,160
We have a new design.

3645
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:47,160
I don't know if you saw the new IM Games t-shirt.

3646
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:49,160
In addition to the IM Games

3647
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,160
and the IM Games After Dark,

3648
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:53,160
which is just white text on a black shirt

3649
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,160
and a black text on a white shirt.

3650
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:57,160
We also have the JoJo meme shirt,

3651
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:59,160
which is

3652
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:01,160
quality shit.

3653
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:03,160
It was a very painstaking design process.

3654
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:05,160
Lots of back and forth in the

3655
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:07,160
design process.

3656
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:09,160
But at the end of the day

3657
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:11,160
the pink comic sans

3658
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:13,160
with a

3659
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,160
bright green glow that just says

3660
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,160
JoJo meme in all lower case

3661
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,160
just seemed like the perfect

3662
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:21,160
representation of our vision for the broad.

3663
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:23,160
Listen. Don't take our word for it.

3664
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:25,160
Listen to Steve.

3665
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:27,160
Steve.

3666
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:29,160
IM Games After This.

3667
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:31,160
After the release of IM Games,

3668
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,160
Steve.

3669
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:35,160
IM Games.

3670
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:37,160
I got to be honest.

3671
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:39,160
The whole

3672
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:41,160
selling the shirt before making

3673
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:43,160
the thing

3674
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:45,160
disgusts me and I hate it.

3675
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:47,160
For

3676
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,160
various reasons.

3677
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:51,160
It just makes me upset.

3678
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:53,160
Well,

3679
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:55,160
I'm sorry, the pre-order.

3680
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:57,160
As someone

3681
02:21:57,160 --> 02:21:59,160
who supports Jeremy Corbin, I'm not surprised

3682
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,160
you don't like capitalism. Anyways, moving on.

3683
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,160
Tom, are you making those shirts

3684
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:05,160
or are you getting them printed somewhere?

3685
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,160
Well, we have them on red bubble and spread shirt,

3686
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,160
but the first run I made in house.

3687
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:11,160
Okay. Cool.

3688
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:13,160
Everyone who got one from that first run

3689
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,160
were handmade and shipped out.

3690
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:17,160
They were made with love.

3691
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:19,160
Over a thousand

3692
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:21,160
shirts sold, right?

3693
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:23,160
Over 10,000 shirts sold, right?

3694
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:25,160
Yeah.

3695
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:27,160
It's just that

3696
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:29,160
it's, you know,

3697
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,160
money spent, actually I can't talk.

3698
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:33,160
I can't talk. I bought the fucking drill

3699
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,160
book of just his tweets.

3700
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,160
But it is a book. It's like, I mean, that is the content.

3701
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:39,160
You know, you're not like...

3702
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:41,160
Well, yeah, I mean, it's just like

3703
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,160
buying a shirt because it's funny to buy

3704
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,160
a shirt so quickly after the creation

3705
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:47,160
of a thing that you're not really a fan of,

3706
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:49,160
but you think it's, it looks cool and that's why

3707
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:51,160
you buy it. Like, I get it.

3708
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:53,160
Is that why you buy clothing?

3709
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:55,160
I don't buy things with things

3710
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,160
on them. I don't like shirts that have

3711
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:59,160
text on them and the fact that like

3712
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,160
90% of commerce is T-shirts

3713
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,160
with words on them

3714
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:05,160
just makes me sad in general

3715
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,160
and the fact that this is like a big thing

3716
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,160
that people are really... Yeah, that's true.

3717
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:11,160
I just...

3718
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:13,160
makes me want a crumpled paper cup.

3719
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:15,160
Oh, fair enough.

3720
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,160
But I mean, see, you're like...

3721
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:19,160
I'm not that mad, but I'm mad enough to crumple a paper cup,

3722
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:21,160
but not enough to like smash

3723
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:23,160
like a steel girdle. I am games

3724
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,160
that's made given I am rage, so...

3725
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:27,160
That's true. What about... I am...

3726
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:29,160
Alright, well, enough of that.

3727
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,160
From Oblivion Fault.

3728
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:33,160
What song would you listen to

3729
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:35,160
during the apocalypse?

3730
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:37,160
I hate my life and I want to die

3731
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:39,160
I don't got no iPhone

3732
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:41,160
My heart is breaking

3733
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:43,160
thinking suicide

3734
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:45,160
I ain't got no iPhone

3735
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:47,160
I was listening to that.

3736
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,160
That's a pretty good one.

3737
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:51,160
Ever listen to that

3738
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:53,160
Tricia Paytas song

3739
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,160
I Hate My Life?

3740
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:57,160
That's a good one.

3741
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:59,160
Imagine some fat

3742
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:01,160
muckbang eating

3743
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:03,160
vlog YouTuber

3744
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:05,160
with a severe depression

3745
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:07,160
who's constantly being

3746
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,160
discarded by the men in her life.

3747
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:11,160
Just saying a song about how she hates her life

3748
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:13,160
and then immediately the next day

3749
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:15,160
releases a song about how Jesus made it all okay.

3750
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:19,160
That's the arc I want to go on.

3751
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:21,160
My song of choice would be

3752
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:23,160
I'd be in the middle of

3753
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:25,160
the war-torn desolate wasteland

3754
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:27,160
air everywhere

3755
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:29,160
air thick with smoke

3756
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:31,160
a giant meteor slowly descending

3757
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:33,160
towards the fucking

3758
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:35,160
doomed face of the planet.

3759
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:37,160
I looked down at my iPod in my hand

3760
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:39,160
and I clicked a button

3761
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:41,160
and the lyrics would rush over me

3762
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,160
and speak to my soul.

3763
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:45,160
I just want to play video games

3764
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:47,160
as the flames engulf me.

3765
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,160
Black Hole for Life

3766
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:51,160
whatever they're called.

3767
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:53,160
In the Boston Institute

3768
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:55,160
of Contemporary Art there is a VR exhibit

3769
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:57,160
like a piece of art

3770
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:59,160
that is you put on the VR

3771
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:01,160
and you live through the apocalypse

3772
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:03,160
and you get to see yourself go to hell and stuff like that.

3773
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:05,160
Is that true? Yeah.

3774
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,160
You get to see everyone die around you.

3775
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:09,160
That's incredible. Yeah, it's great.

3776
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,160
Like, really. This is actually real.

3777
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:13,160
Yeah, this is actually real.

3778
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:15,160
It might be gone now because it might have been part of an exhibit that is gone now, but

3779
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:17,160
but I was there

3780
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,160
and I got to see

3781
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:21,160
the giant tidal wave crash over myself.

3782
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:23,160
The best part about it

3783
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:25,160
is that because it was made for this museum

3784
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:27,160
you start out in the museum

3785
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,160
where you are presently standing

3786
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:31,160
in real life and you get to see the wave

3787
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:33,160
actually crash into you.

3788
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,160
That's dope. Yeah, it's great.

3789
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:37,160
And then you get to see yourself go to hell and get eaten and shit.

3790
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:39,160
What's hell like?

3791
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:41,160
It's just kind of like the PS2 opening.

3792
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:43,160
Yeah, right.

3793
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:45,160
That's what I think about it. By the way,

3794
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:47,160
if this video is not a joke,

3795
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:49,160
if this video gets 300 likes,

3796
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:51,160
I will cover at the top of my lungs of

3797
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,160
I ain't got no iPhone. I will do a full cover.

3798
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,160
There you go, people. Smash that motherfucking

3799
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:57,160
like button right now.

3800
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:59,160
Don't forget to subscribe and ring that mother

3801
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,160
flippin' bell so you get every notification

3802
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,160
from the procrastinators.

3803
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:05,160
Are we done?

3804
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:07,160
Let's play Tobuscus. Can we do like a crossover

3805
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,160
with Tobuscus? That's a really good idea.

3806
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,160
I think we've got a lot in common with that guy.

3807
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:13,160
Both rape apologists.

3808
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,160
Hey, he was

3809
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:17,160
not convicted of anything.

3810
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,160
He is innocent until

3811
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:21,160
proven guilty.

3812
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:23,160
That's what I have to say. There you go.

3813
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:25,160
There you go. A woman defends him,

3814
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:27,160
therefore he didn't do it. That's it, everybody.

3815
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,160
That's fair. That makes sense to me.

3816
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:31,160
All right, I think we're done.

3817
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,160

$5 page bonus episodes.

3824
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:47,160
By the time you hear this,

3825
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:49,160
there will be a new episode

3826
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,160
up and running, and I won't spoil it,

3827
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:53,160
but let's just say

3828
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:55,160
come hungry.

3829
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:57,160
Come hungry and come often.

3830
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:59,160
That's my motto in life.

3831
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:01,160
I hate my life

3832
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,160
and I want to...

3833
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,160

3834
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:07,160
We'll see you next time.

3835
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:09,160
Thanks for being here.

3836
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:11,160
Bye!

3837
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:17,160
All right, I'm done.

3838
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:47,160
Don't want to do it.
