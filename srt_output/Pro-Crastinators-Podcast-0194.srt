00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, welcome. It's PCP. You know what it is. You know where you are. Welcome,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
one and all. I'm the best guy ever. Join today by my brother Ben Saint.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's nap time on the PCP. It's time to go to bed.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And you know him. Beloved sisters of Battle, Munchy, and Gibbontake. They're sisters. This is their lore.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're brothers. They're sisters. This is a shit intro I don't care about. Radcon!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, you're a week late idiot. We already talked about that last week.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, but the Kickstarter is like out, right? Or you know, gonna be out?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It may well be. It's possible. As a recording, we only God knows.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Did I tell you Ben that I was wrong about the 8-day thing? It's actually like a 1-3-day review period.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I saw the message. That's simply epic.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is Kickstarter out by now? Is it not out by now? Only unchecked by doing the description.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My Kickstarter got approved in like an hour. So I'm hoping it performs similarly.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I feel it's a little awkward. If we knew it was coming out, I would love to be. Go to it now.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But I can say, if it is out, it's Schrodinger's kick. Go to it now.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Check the description.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Check the description box.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This Kickstarter exists in a state of superposition until examined, upon which time the URL links to the Kickstarter.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we'll see if that happens.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to have a real heart to heart, real father to son moment with the audience right here.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because I want to hopefully illustrate why exactly I'm back right now at this crucial juncture in the PCP's development.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because for the past couple months, I've been thinking, you know, recording the PCP, whatever.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who even fucking cares about that shit?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I hate money also.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What? Democrats? Republicans? I love those guys. And then I wouldn't go on the PCP.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then, going to the PCP chat to discuss Radcon 4, you know, getting all worked up about this, and spending the many, many late hours at night.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am so fucking sick of all of you after this week of nothing but nonstop discord calls working out all the bullshit.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm at the exact opposite where it's like, oh my god, actually I like everyone. Oh god, the PCP's cool actually.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So let's see if the PCP's cool or just the PC is cool.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
On this episode, this will be a tryout run.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What? I hear you.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh wait, no I get it. It took me a second.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Very, very hard to understand.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're going to have a battle against our rival, the MacP, you know?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Make Donald?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You know what I'm saying?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Stop, you're making me hungry.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tim Cook?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you want to go get McDonald's Ben?

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, a little bit. I'll just go get my classic two McDoubles, throw away the bun.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Dude, the other day I ate two McDoubles and it felt like I was a fucking god.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Did you throw away the bun?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, I didn't.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, you were fucking wrong.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I like the bun. I feel like the bun...

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, you like inflammation, you like diabetes.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You like to be a fucking coward.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I like soggy bread and I like ketchup and mustard which gets stained all over the bun.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Loves that sugar rest. Loves that insulin spike in his blood, you know?

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh wait, I've been counting my calories and I, every single day, every single day has just been constant agony and not even worth it-ness.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Because I'm so fucking hungry. I'm just nodding off my own arm every single second that I get.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm literally the hungriest person and I'm starving to death actively as we speak right fucking now.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's been a nightmare.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It has been challenging.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's great.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Try to go an entire day without eating.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I did that yesterday until, I guess, Michelle did bring me a bunch of mochi late in the day, but it's not that hard.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just for fun. And then you'll wake up the next day and you'll be hungry but you won't want to eat that much because you'll get full really fast.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have done that before in the past, like intentionally, like I've fasted for a couple days.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean, I could use it again to refresh my memory.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I mean, because if you're used to eating a lot or more and then you go down to less, you're like, oh no, I'm accustomed to more food than this.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But if you fast for a little bit and then you start eating again, you're accustomed to less.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's genius moves.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're going to tell them comments that are just like, um, that's really like a bad view.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're irresponsible. You're going to kill, you're going to kill a munchie, Ben. What are you doing?

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He doesn't know any better.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Dude, if you don't eat food for one day, you fucking keel over and die so you could put a clock strikes mid night.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If there's one man who needs more kidney stones, it's munchie. There's no doubt.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ben's got you covered on that front.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Speaking of food, I was walking past you.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Highly speculative.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was in the grocery store the other day and I was walking past the ice cream section.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I looked inside and you know, gazed at what it could be if I were a different man.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I was looking and I saw an ice cream that I want to know your guys opinion on because I've been asked, I've been pulling everyone.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It seems nearly unanimous and I don't know why this product exists because it's so obviously reviled.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There's an ice cream where it is vanilla ice cream and then inside of the ice cream pent, there is french fries.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like just pieces of french fries inside of it.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, no, no.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dipping french fries into shakes is delicious.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No, I'm against that as well.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, I'm against that too.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're against that too.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, I don't get it at all.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For sure.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For sure.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, okay, okay.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I understand french fries and chocolate a little bit because it's like salted chocolate sort of thing.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I never really understood the milkshake thing.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's a slightly more socially acceptable version of like melting a slice of American cheese on your apple pie.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's equivalently disgusting to me.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It doesn't make any sense and I don't see the appeal at all.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The reason why you would dip a french fry into a shake is because you're getting a massive difference in texture and in flavor.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's like way different things.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, it's hot and it's cold.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's fluffy and crunchy and it's soft and sweet.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's way different.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You put them in an explosion of different types of perspective.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you trying to say that you're pro this thing, Munchie?

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, I'm not trying to say that.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's obviously saying that.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Listen to how lovingly he's describing the experience.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But he just said no.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He's lying.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He's lying.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There's a difference here.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There's a difference here.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Dipping in a shake is not like this ice cream pint at all because the fucking french fries are all soggy and gross and cold and disgusting.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They aren't fluffier crispy and they aren't hot.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They don't balance against the ice cream at all.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They're just fucking potatoes.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I guess I sort of see the path of logic that would convince one to make this product.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
These fries have been processed and they have lived in that ice cream for who knows how.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sure they've fucking absorbed their native environment and just become a homogenous mess.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How many fries are we tossing inside this block of ice cream?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It sounds at best dumb and pointless and at worst disgusting.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm very against it.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yep.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I see no justification for allowing this in a civilized society.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Imagine if you could have fucking...

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Look at this cross-section.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't see it.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
While you post that.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What were you saying Gib?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm trying to imagine it.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh yeah.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Could you like fucking imagine like energy drink ice creams?

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Imagine bang ice cream.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can imagine it.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh my god.

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh my god guys.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have said it.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I have said it for years.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yesterday I found a...

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was looking at vapes.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was looking at vape flavors and I found it.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They made it.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They made caffeinated vape.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Whoa.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Really?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
With like taurine and B vitamins and shit.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like energy drink vape.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want some so bad but they were sold out.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I just...

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
For the sake of argument is through the lungs the correct way to absorb like B12 and you know...

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You know it's a reasonable question and I don't know the answer.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Maybe.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I mean the point is...

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's the superior option.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The point is I've been saying...

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like take it in the ass.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've been saying the caffeinated vape sounds incredible and like something I want for a long time and I saw it.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's real.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Somebody fucking did it.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ben I had the exact same fucking altercation.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I found caffeinated water and they're like really fucking expensive for some reason.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Some order this as soon as I get and then I can get hydrated and caffeinated at the exact same thing.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We should be sponsored by waterjoe.com.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just water and caffeine.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What more do you need?

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Dude look at how fucking like oh my god please think that I'm like really fucking healthy for you.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Please think that I will like make you cool.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They're clearly marketing this as like like to the people who like wake up, have like a cup of coffee, a black coffee and go to the gym.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They're like fuck the coffee man.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You just need the water and the caffeine.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're a god of sports.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This french fry ice cream and I'm looking at the cross section.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I literally can't see the french fries.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We're talking about small bits of fries at most.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They are totally indistinguishable.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They don't look any different.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh look at that.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Aka in quote fast food.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like on the label.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Stupid.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah I guess so.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I mean I'd give it a try.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Actually you know I almost feel like the fact that it's like enmeshed in there and more and homogenized and just sort of blended into the.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It might make it better than.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It might.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Cause I'm on record.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't do the dip fries in milkshake thing.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't get it.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It doesn't appeal to me.

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I think maybe this might be better than that.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just because maybe it would just sort of lend a kind of starchy salty texture to the ice cream itself.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Maybe.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'd give it a shot.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know what sounds like a really satisfying job though.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Being the guy who does cross sections of ice cream containers.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Probably gets a paid mad shit.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cause this is definitely like a fucking shit.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean we're talking about a pro photographer.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
People who made this ice cream are definitely on the fucking flight logs.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Honestly this doesn't look like that professional shot to me.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like the resolution is not amazing.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But imagine taking this tub out of the freezer and just put it on the table and just take a knife and just like work it down through and split it in half and then set it out and take a picture.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah I'd love to do that.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you think that they are working it down or do you think it's like a clean like samurai katana slice down the middle?

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This looks like a fairly clean cut.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You need like a level 2, like a level 3, level 4 samurai to execute a slice of this level.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You would want to get a very clean cross section with like a good down the middle cut.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I don't think that like a clean like fast stroke would do that.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You would want to like play carefully place the knife on top of the tub and just like push it down slowly.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sure they use like a bandsaw or some sort of like table.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're probably right.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thing to go zzz.

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait dude.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Wait imagine.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay this cross section like this pint that's been cut in half.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What happens like after this photo?

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like does it just start like leaking out?

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like just start melting immediately and just spill on the fucking floor?

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean well yeah.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They just throw it on the trash.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They're not going to eat it?

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The cameraman's not going to eat every ice cream?

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you mourning that somewhere out there a pint of ice cream was thrown away and not consumes?

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's the principle of the matter.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I understand.

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
People are starving in Africa.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's true.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's true.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Wait okay going back to this caffeinated water thing real quick.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I just want to say that I like every single day have been waking up and I've been drinking energy drinks.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And they're all great and they're literally good for you at any doctor that tells you that they aren't.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's literally fucking lying to you and it makes no fucking sense and I don't even understand it.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's literally paid off in every way.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's paid off by big sport water.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
My brain and body hurt all the time now and I'm starting to crumple up into like origami.

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And so I'm thinking okay maybe all this extra sodium and stuff that I'm getting from the energy drink is maybe not good.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I love caffeine and caffeine is actually good for you and any doctor that tells you that it's not is literally lying to you and wrong.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So how can I get caffeine and anything else?

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I agree.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've got a prescription for you and the prescription is get up and do yoga.

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do yoga.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
First thing don't drink coffee.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do yoga for 10 minutes when you wake up.

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you for real?

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've been doing it.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I've been doing it the last little while.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You could do both.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Those aren't mutually exclusive.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But one is free.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
One is free though.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's a plus for me.

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What am I even coughing?

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well yeah.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean technically.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Coffee costs nothing.

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Ben listen to the awe in Munchie's voice.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She's clearly into it.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Be a yogi guy.

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm disgusted to the point of surprise.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't believe what I just fucking heard.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It was like a brain shock to me.

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Nate you do yoga?

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Is this the fucking bitch cast right now?

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What's going on?

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I am a mildly surprised.

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But like I don't care either.

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah well it's not that interesting.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My fucking tea is dropping at astronomical levels.

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What's wrong with yoga?

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're prepetuating.

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is literally toxic masculine.

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're prepetuating unhealthy gender stereotypes.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think we have to vote fucking Nate on.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I specifically made sure I wasn't gay.

276
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I respected the gender binary by making sure I did yoga for men.

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Like all videos are exactly the same.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I watched one for men.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Thank god.

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I mean the way I think of yoga.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like the first thing I think of is like the Wii balance board.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Dolce from Street Fighter?

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

284
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The Wii fit.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like I think of yoga in that.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I'm like yeah video games.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I like yoga.

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's gay.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's a male fit.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can choose a man if you want.

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But the default is female.

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Improving that it's default female.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
God why do they have to make it so political by making the default female?

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
By choosing a woman.

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah yeah.

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh have I told you guys the most hilarious joke I ever heard from a feminist

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that I thought was legitimately great.

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was like it was just a Twitter post.

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And it's like you know whatever.

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And her post is that like doctor like it says to new father.

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a girl.

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Father replies ooh I just think that that's a little political.

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like why you put your agenda into like.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why did it have to be a girl though?

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like what does that add to its arc?

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah exactly.

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Great joke.

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
A legitimately great joke.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Alright.

310
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I hate women.

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Enough misogyny.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Enough of that because now it's time to talk about my Lord of Ghost comic that came out.

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh of course it's out and it's great.

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah it's so good dude.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh thank you.

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's delicious.

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's so good.

318
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I read it and I jumped onto Discord and I was like at Hippocrite.

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Fuck I love this Lord of Ghost comic.

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's wicked cool.

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thanks for making it bro.

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The structure is creative and excellently executed.

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I know the only reason you made this comic is because you wanted to jump on the PCP

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and say hey guys and then I want to say back to you to fulfill all your hopes and dreams

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and your blood and your sweat and your tears.

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're cool.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh thanks guys.

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The Lord of Ghost is cool.

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey fuck you.

330
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Can we get the Lord of Ghost on the PCP?

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That'd be pretty cool.

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Please?

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He's called in before Hezney?

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't remember.

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think he has.

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's been on at least once.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's been on a bonus episode.

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I mean he's a constant present.

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He should come back to promote his comic though.

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He definitely should leave a voicemail or something.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's sort of the elephant in the room that no one will acknowledge.

342
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well it's sort of like the ghost in the room actually.

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He has no elephant things about him.

344
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think you're thinking of terst where they've been?

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am thinking of terst where they've literally been.

346
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
All right enough.

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Tell us about it.

348
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Tell us the tale.

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh yeah.

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Well how did this come about?

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why are you doing this?

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Also I want to know is this like the main comic you're working on?

353
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Because I knew you were working on two.

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Is there a big one?

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm technically working on three.

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is like plan-wise.

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is like a practice comic to try and understand how they're made

358
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and how to plan them and make them and stuff.

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then in the future I'll be working on more original things

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that aren't tied to existing things like Endless War and whatever.

361
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Right.

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was going to ask about that.

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But yeah this came about because I wanted to...

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ever since the Lord of Ghosts canonically became mayor

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was exiled or like killed and I decided he should be exiled

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I wanted him to be a character in my rotating cast of characters

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
that I can use for things.

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I was always thinking of making a comic,

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
depicting what happens outside.

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And so the obvious thing...

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Outside of the city?

372
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Outside of the city.

373
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The next chapter is him traveling outside the city.

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There's going to be a number of chapters, maybe five each of 20 pages in length.

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I got to tell you Gib, I'm sick to death of Inside Slime City.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What's going on outside Slime City?

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No it's not.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There's nothing interesting going on out there.

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's just a normal ass United States.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's just desert and then probably towns and it's dumb and don't worry about it.

382
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And like people...

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's not even any slime...

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't know if you know this.

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There's not any slime out there.

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's crazy.

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Anyway, hippo continue.

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But yeah, I wanted to do that.

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I had this idea...

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Originally it was going to be like Bale shape I was still working on.

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was going to finish that.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I had written or like sort of planned out some of this comic.

393
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then I was going to sketch it and hand it over to some RFCK people to like do the drawing.

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Or some people I, you know, some art friends who are some RFCK related.

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But it like it took me until the end of the year to finish the sketches because I was busy doing other things.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And by that time they had like, they had realized and sort of I had realized as well that if I were to hand these sketches over to them because they were too complete.

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They wouldn't be able to like do their own style on top of them.

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And so it would sort of be like kind of pointless for them to be involved.

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I decided, nah, I'm just going to do it.

400
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then I started doing it in January 1st.

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I inked and shaded the first 20 pages and I pushed them.

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And it was very prolific and it was very good.

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I was very happy with a lot of the stuff in there.

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The way the pages are like, you know, coming down in the beginning.

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How it explains everything you need to know without too much like pointless extra stuff.

406
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And the characterization things I put in there.

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
My favorite thing about the whole intro is that the entire time Lord of Ghosts is referring to himself as you.

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because he's anticipating as correctly that he will forget who he is and need to read it.

409
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And so he'll he's writing it like an instructional guide, like you are this.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This is what you are thinking.

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But on the very last page when he thinks he's going to die, he writes, I it's like I'm scared.

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And because he's like thinking that this is the end.

413
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He's like so panicky that he forgot to do that.

414
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He's not he's not writing it to his future self.

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, he's just being scared.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm so cool when I thought of that.

417
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And I was like, yeah, I'm fucking smart or something.

418
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The whole the whole thing about how I just I said this in the discord.

419
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But the whole like the whole first part of it that is just like it's the pages that he wrote to himself.

420
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And sometimes as you see the pay like in the background, like between pages,

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you can see like the nega slime over the city and stuff.

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's so good.

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's so fucking cool.

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Holy shit.

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey, incidentally, can you tell him where they can read it?

426
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So everybody who's now dying to do it.

427
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You can go to give and take a dot site.

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It should be the first comic at the top there.

429
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's my web comic website.

430
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Bill J. was on there.

431
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
All my stuff is on there.

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I also have a tapas tick tapas dot IO slash give and take or something and a web toon thing.

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I think and you can find it on there.

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There will be links and I'm just going to post to those three places every time I update.

435
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hopefully every single time, every single time.

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm hoping this is optimistic, but I'm hoping to get the next chapter done in the in the in the next week.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Maybe probably be like 10 11 days from now from from this recording.

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh my God, that's nothing.

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But by the way, I want I want to say that you do not have to be an rf2k whiz kid to understand this.

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, it is very, very, very user friendly.

441
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like you can basically know nothing about it in this war and you will be able to easily.

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I mean, even if you didn't know anything about it, like I don't.

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, you would totally get what's happening.

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I mean, there's a little bit explains to you.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I mean, you know, you'll have to use some context clues in some areas.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But for the most part, you're going to be able to basically get every single thing.

447
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean, if you have context in the endless war, some some things might be like, oh, I know what that is.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But like, it's not like it's perfectly understandable without that.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, that was my main thing.

450
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Just like slime and punishment.

451
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Slime and punishment is also that way.

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
By the way, people just like endless war itself.

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
By the way, it's not that fucking hard to get into you.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Stupid fucking idiots.

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's literally not that hard.

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's really fucking simple.

457
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You fucking boobs.

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was really thinking of like the digi factor.

459
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like if I told Digi to read this, would he?

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I think the fact that he knows what endless war is, he would be like, oh, it's not for me.

461
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But like, I will try to convince him because it's the only thing that is RFCK is the setting.

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I like structured it with like Act One, Act Two, Act Three, like a real story with a character that you're following.

463
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's just a narrative.

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You don't need to know any prior knowledge.

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's just a narrative.

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's just a narrative.

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can just read it.

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's like the polar opposite of it's just two frames.

469
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Like you derisively like just two frames, then you like happy looking up towards heaven.

470
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's a real narrative.

471
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I feel so powerful.

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Maybe if we're lucky we play our cards right, we can make enough money to fly Lord of Ghosts out to Radcon for Mappy and I's special guest.

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He was at RFCKCon London.

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He was hanging out.

475
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I wonder what point in his timeline that occurred.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I wonder when and where that happens.

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or maybe it's an out of canon experience.

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Out of body experience.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
My wonder.

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I wonder what's for dinner.

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
If we acquire vast sums of cash required to buy one bed sheet and perhaps scissors to cut holes in the eyes,

482
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
maybe we could use that as a material vessel to summon forth the Lord of Ghosts from wherever he exists in Canada.

483
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We'll have to get like a pentagram and place those in the middle.

484
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, I getcha.

485
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

486
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That would be great.

487
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We'll have to get some slime.

488
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We'll have to get some anti-slime to tempt him.

489
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know, quick aside on this out of canon thing.

490
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You know, we had an interesting experience on my Nuzlocke yesterday,

491
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
which was the time finally came for Russell to shed his mortal coil.

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I was there.

493
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I was there.

494
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, were you?

495
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
When Radifriker's cop killers ended, you were still going, so I...

496
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's right.

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I forgot to say it in the chat, so I said,

498
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I ended the stream and then a minute later I was like,

499
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
wait a minute, fuck, I can raid.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Some of the people had left, but I raided with whoever was left.

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Please keep doing it.

502
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I mean, I just can't remember to do that ever, but I always mean to.

503
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Try to remember.

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I know it's hard.

505
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I did it.

506
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You can do it too, Nate.

507
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I believe in you.

508
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Once I get in the habit, I will do it.

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's true.

510
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I did it the last time.

511
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Honestly, it's good practice.

512
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Just pick a fucking stranger and raid him.

513
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You're right.

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
As long as your name gets out there, that's probably good for you.

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, like nobody loses anything by it.

516
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's just a good...

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Just end every stream by raiding someone.

518
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why the fuck not?

519
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's a good thing.

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's a good thing.

521
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll try to do that.

522
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm not gonna say.

523
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But anyway, the point is that I stuck around because I saw the trials of Russell.

524
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Right.

525
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,240
So we were in this horrible battle in the underground in Goldenrod, and there was this boy with

526
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,000
psychic powers who was really fucking me up.

527
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, no.

528
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is Route 36.

529
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It doesn't matter.

530
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,160
We got into one of those situations where if anything happened, someone was gonna die,

531
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,000
and this is exactly what Russell was made for.

532
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,560
If I remember, it was because you had Doon Koon, the Pidgeot, no, the Pidgeotto, and you

533
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,160
were gonna quick attack there at Kadabra, I think, but he was confused.

534
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,720
So if the quick attack had gone off, you would have won, but if you were stricken with confusion,

535
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
you would kill yourself because you were a low HP.

536
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,160
And the way to guarantee the victory would be to switch in.

537
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
So it was a total coinflip.

538
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Total coinflip.

539
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Exactly.

540
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,640
So the only thing to do was to put out Russell to take the blow, switch back into Pidgeotto,

541
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
and that guarantees success.

542
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,240
The only thing to do was take the coward's way out.

543
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
That's exactly what...

544
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,400
Everyone was cheering for we hashtag LetRussellRussell, and he wrestled his fiercest, and actually

545
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,040
he had a little moment of glory earlier in the stream as a Rattata too.

546
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,400
All in all, not much more a little Rattata who believed in himself could do.

547
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,880
That's the guy destined to fucking die, it seems like.

548
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,680
You didn't grind enough, Nate.

549
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,600
You had like a 19 and a 20, and then all your other guys were like level five, level six,

550
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
level two.

551
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
It's true.

552
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,080
I should spend more time grinding.

553
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
But you know what?

554
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,840
Russell was yearning for death anyway, to escape this shell that felt so wrong, whereas he

555
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,880
foolishly donated too much and caught a fucking Rattata.

556
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,240
Aren't we all?

557
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,040
All I'm saying is that I think in the Chronology of the Pokémon series, Pokémon Gold or Silver

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,520
takes place so far in any of our Nuzlocks featuring Russell earliest in the timeline.

559
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm wondering if perhaps this Rattata is the original incarnation of Russell.

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,960
Oh, so you're saying it's the tale's been told out of chronological order.

561
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Exactly.

562
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
It may well be.

563
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
What a storied history.

564
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,440
I mean, Rattata is a purple boy, becomes a purple ghost, there's connections here.

565
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Who can say?

566
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Who can say?

567
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
It's true.

568
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,240
I wanted to say, by the way, I wanted to ask you something about the comic.

569
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,160
I wanted to know what it was like drawing the final line art.

570
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
What was that experience like?

571
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Because I know that you have always had a bit of an issue like, oh, my art is bad.

572
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,400
But your art's really good in this.

573
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
So how did you reconcile those two contradictory facts?

574
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Well, I think due to just generally drawing a lot at the end, last few months of the last

575
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
year, it was good practice, good, good, all that.

576
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,680
I think with the sketches that were very robust and pretty much perfect as they were in terms

577
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,400
of structure, like where the characters were located.

578
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,240
It was just a matter of making it clean.

579
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,480
I think, I don't know, it just sort of worked out.

580
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,120
There were parts where it was like, ah, that's a little sloppy when I zoom real close in.

581
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,160
But if I focus too hard on this.

582
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Never zoom in.

583
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,520
Working drawing digitally, never zoom in.

584
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,400
I zoom in a little bit.

585
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
It's always a mistake.

586
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
You always regret it.

587
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,880
Because you can see tiny little bits here and there.

588
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,040
Well, I like to zoom in just so that I can see dots that are easily get rid of a bowl.

589
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:30,960
Dots that are far away that were from an earlier part where I was erasing a big line.

590
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,360
I felt like doing the due diligence to clean it up a little bit before I move on.

591
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,960
But not to redraw everything because the line isn't smooth enough.

592
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm sort of becoming more comfortable with just seeing how it goes.

593
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,160
Seeing how I draw the first few times and not redrawing too much unless it's like seriously

594
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,200
bothering me.

595
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,080
I guess my threshold for what seriously bothers me has changed.

596
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,040
Now I'm like, yeah, you know, it's not important for this to be the most beautiful thing ever.

597
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,000
Even though I did design it so that it could be potentially printed at some point as a

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
book.

599
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm not sure how possible that would be, but that would be nice having a lot of ghosts.

600
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,960
That's how I feel with slime and punishment.

601
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,760
Not every panel needs to be a masterpiece.

602
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
Just fucking draw it and if it gets the most of the time it's enough just to get the idea

603
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,880
across and not look bad and that's fine.

604
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,400
I think the main thing that was different from compared to just drawings in general

605
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,080
is that I was keeping track of the size of the pen brush when doing certain things like

606
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,440
the boxes are always like 15 point when I was drawing those.

607
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:00,080
Oh, this is, I can talk about this afterwards, Photoshop tattled on me and told Adobe that

608
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,960
I was using a pirated version.

609
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,720
I don't know, I've seen that on my computer recently and there's a process you can kill

610
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,040
to get rid of it, but it is annoying.

611
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,200
Well, the thing it was like I was getting annoyed with Photoshop generally anyway because

612
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,600
it sort of lags a lot and sometimes it just like lags indefinitely and there's no fix

613
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,360
so I have to turn the computer off and on again for it to be okay.

614
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,560
So I was like, you know what, this is a good reason to just not have Photoshop anymore

615
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,520
and I got one of those many, many, many free alternatives.

616
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
What'd you get?

617
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,760
I got Medibang paint.

618
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,360
What the fuck is that?

619
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,720
It's something I heard Tom talk about once and I was like, I'll remember that, I guess.

620
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
And it's really good.

621
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,320
This is like the ball-pitted McDonald's version of Photoshop.

622
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
It sounds really good.

623
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,920
You can do basically all the same things with all the same shortcut commands, but it has

624
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,720
some improvements and it is sort of designed for writing mangas.

625
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,440
This is like Pintuol Psy 2, that's all there is.

626
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,120
I really like Mango Studio, but it did take me forever to pirate it.

627
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,040
It took me like multiple days of working on it.

628
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
Maybe I'm just stupid, but it's really hard.

629
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,400
The future is free shit, I guess.

630
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
It's a free program.

631
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,440
You can download it right now and it has this great tool where you can click a grid, like

632
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,000
an assist grid thing and it can be like straight lines or like a crisscross pattern or like

633
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,440
a radial thing or a circle thing and you align it.

634
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,760
If I wanted to draw straight lines going in one direction, such as rain, I can align

635
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,280
it to be a certain thing and then when I draw, it only goes on that specific angle.

636
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,880
So I can't fuck up the angles, which is really nice.

637
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
That's pretty convenient.

638
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,560
I mean, with Mango Studio, I can kind of do that by just, I rotate the canvas instead

639
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,680
of the axis and it works, I guess it would accomplish the same thing, but that's pretty

640
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
good.

641
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,120
Drawing digitally is so much better than traditional.

642
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
It's just better.

643
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,880
I don't understand why people still do traditional.

644
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:10,440
I think people say it's good to be well versed in both because they'll influence each other,

645
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
I guess.

646
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Okay.

647
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,920
Or at least traditional will make you better at drawing digitally.

648
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Traditional can impart a certain aesthetic, like a watercolor painting has a certain

649
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,880
feel to it, and that's cool and all, but that's bullshit and aesthetic is all bullshit

650
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,760
and it's just about getting the idea across and digital, it's just so much less complicated

651
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
to do it digitally.

652
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Listen, I'm all for digital, but the aesthetic is part of the idea sometimes.

653
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
Sometimes you want to convey a certain feeling.

654
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Not for me.

655
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Oh, jeez.

656
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,400
I wonder, I guess that's why your art looks like that, huh, Ben?

657
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Hell yes.

658
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Hell yes.

659
00:31:50,400 --> 00:32:00,360
I think I said last time, but the way I'm working with these comics is this one's going

660
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,840
to be digitally, and then I'm going to try doing one that is traditional, just to see

661
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,720
how much more difficult or easy or better it makes it because it's something I should

662
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,360
try at least.

663
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,520
I initially tried inking vapors one traditionally, and I got two pages in, and I was like, nah,

664
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,400
this isn't going to work.

665
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,680
I'm just not up to it.

666
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,120
To then scan it and do all the shit you have to fix with it anyway, I mean, fuck that.

667
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,960
I tried to use a nib pen because I had just read Bakuman, and I was like, what the fuck

668
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
is this thing?

669
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Who made this?

670
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,200
Hey, so this comic is cool and all, but we only know any comic or piece of media is

671
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,400
as good as the memes that are generated out of it, so more importantly, let me just save

672
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,200
this comic from the dustbin of history by posting this, guys, this is literally me when

673
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm so fucking scared.

674
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,080
This is literally me, everyone, post how this is literally you when you're so scared of

675
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
shit.

676
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,920
Now that we've thoroughly disrespected Hippos comic and everything about his character,

677
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,040
we can finally move on to a new fucking topic.

678
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,520
Yeah, that's fair.

679
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,080
Guys, listen, if the reason, well Hippo, do you have anything else you want to say about

680
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
your comic?

681
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
Go read it right now.

682
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Go read it, yeah.

683
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Very good.

684
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I think we all vouch for it's quite.

685
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
What is the release schedule this going to be?

686
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,080
Not like, when is it going to do do do do do do do, but you're going to do page by page,

687
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
batch by batch.

688
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm going to do chapters, like originally I didn't have chapters, I just sketched a bunch

689
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:40,920
of pages, but I'm thinking a 20 page chapter is meaty and cool.

690
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
It is, it is.

691
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,720
And to drop that would be like, oh my God, read the thing.

692
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,400
And I was like, yeah, hell yeah.

693
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
So yes.

694
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Is there any time we can look forward to that in the future?

695
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Do you know what I promise anything?

696
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,640
I mean, initially, like I was saying, like, optimistically, I could do 20 pages of this

697
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
because it's all sketched.

698
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,280
I could line it and shade it in like a week each chapter.

699
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,680
Did you say it's all sketched, like the entire thing?

700
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,440
The entire thing is sketched, like I wanted to have it finished.

701
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,720
So it's already a completed story in your mind.

702
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Damn.

703
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,840
I mean, it was already a completed story when I wrote it and completed it and wrote all

704
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,440
the dialogue and like character actions in a screenplay format.

705
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,560
Well, I don't know about anybody else, but to me, that makes it be like, oh shit, this

706
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,440
thing is real and we'll be completed.

707
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,880
There's no like, I don't know what the ending is going to be, I'll figure it out.

708
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
That's great news.

709
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
You mind?

710
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Yep.

711
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,480
We'll go read it, people.

712
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
Go to give him, take that site and read it.

713
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
There you go.

714
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Go read all the shit.

715
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Fuck you.

716
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,840
I haven't been able to do any slime and punishment work lately and because I put that on.

717
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,440
Because I put that on the back burner for the, to finish the vapors to a Kickstarter work.

718
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,800
And then I put that on the back burner because this Redcon 4 shit cropped up, but um.

719
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,240
Have you given Cassie her vaporette yet?

720
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
No.

721
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Epic.

722
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Yeah.

723
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Whatever.

724
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Leave me alone.

725
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,760
Hey, listen, audience, if it sounds like I'm tired right now, then there's a very good

726
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,960
reason for that because I was staying up until 4 a.m. last night to work on Lonesome Cactus,

727
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,560
which is a new bot that you can click on and play with in the Quickdraw server.

728
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,400
You remember, you may remember the old PCP drawcasts.

729
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,440
Those are dead and gone and buried, but Quickdraw is the new hotness and Lonesome Cactus is

730
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
just the first part of the puzzle that you can go and play with right now.

731
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,600
It is a game sort of kind of more like it's like robust discord reaction enhancements that

732
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,200
make you even more likely to whore out your body and your soul for points that mean nothing

733
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,120
and do nothing, but look cool and you be like, fuck you.

734
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
And it's great.

735
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,480
So click on the link in the description to be taken to the Quickdraw discord.

736
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:12,160
So it's like you post images as it is a drawing art server thing and people react with certain

737
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,600
emotes to indicate how much they like it and you get bounty, you get a thing, you get currency

738
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,600
for how many reactions you get to your art is the idea.

739
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,880
And depending on what reactions they give you and if you have a collab with people,

740
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,840
then they get all reactions, or they get all bounty too.

741
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,280
It's basically a point system to incentivize people to get as much like a high bounty as

742
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,440
they possibly can by creating as much art as they fucking can in this discord server,

743
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,200
which by the way, it's like tied to Quickdraw in the sense that it's tied to Quickdraw,

744
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,440
but this is just an art server.

745
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
So if you ever have those art servers, which everyone's in, they joined some fucking posseass

746
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,000
art server and it's always like, yeah, okay, I guess the people in here are cool, I guess

747
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,160
so, but you know in your heart of hearts, you fucking hate all of them because all of

748
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,080
them are lame sauce and all of them are veggies, you don't even fucking matter.

749
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,040
Then click on this one because this one will literally make fun of you and bully you relentlessly

750
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,600
unless you have a high bounty and a roll name and you will get a fire under your ass and

751
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,960
you will be completely obliterated unless you have a high bounty.

752
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,040
You get like a, you get a notification from Lonesome Cactus screaming at you every one

753
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
second.

754
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Yeah, literally.

755
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Well, it's great.

756
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,080
Well, it's to keep me from gaming the system hardcore, failure of a draw hack that I am

757
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:43,560
and just racking up massive pointage to sail by and just survive on surplus labor of others.

758
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,600
The thing is, how would you make that happen?

759
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,160
I enlist a cabal of collaborators and we all cheat the system and vote for each other.

760
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,040
Is this, can I break your game?

761
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Can I ruin everyone's fun?

762
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
You have to spend bounty to have.

763
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
You already have.

764
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,440
So if you don't have your bounty to give, then you can't, like, they can't get bounty.

765
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,480
So you theoretically, I mean, theoretically, if all of your people were accruing massive

766
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
amounts of bounty, you know, from other people, then you would be able to spend on all one

767
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,800
another and inflate your scores.

768
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,960
But everyone fucking hates you and everyone hates all Nate heads, so no one would ever

769
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
give you anything.

770
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,600
That's the landscape we're dealing with right now.

771
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,320
Wait, so if I, if someone has a zero bounty and they resonate, they click the resonate

772
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,200
emote with an art piece, does that person not get any bounty?

773
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,920
No, no, they get bounty, but they get the negative bounty, which has massive ramifications

774
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,600
for their social currency.

775
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,480
They are basically like in the complete, like lower rungs of society.

776
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,320
They are in the like the half basements in parasite.

777
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,760
They are that like lower class family.

778
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,680
I don't see how this operates.

779
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,600
Like if somebody joins the server, they have zero bounty and they react to things.

780
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,120
Do people lose bounty?

781
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes, you can theoretically go into negative bounty, but that wouldn't happen.

782
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,120
But like, surely if people join the server, then everyone will like, you know, they'll

783
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,560
react to things, not knowing this, and then everyone will just lose bounty until everyone

784
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
has negative bounty.

785
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Wait, you lose bounty?

786
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
You lose bounty by reacting to stuff?

787
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,360
I don't understand the mathematics.

788
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,440
You spend way less bounty to give more.

789
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,800
So you are spending like a fourth of the bounty that you reward other people.

790
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,280
So people are all a net getting way more bounty than they are losing bounty.

791
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,880
It's merely it's merely like a system to make it so that you are at least somewhat stingy

792
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
with what you give out.

793
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,720
And you aren't just reacting to every single thing with the highest tier reaction.

794
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Hmm.

795
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Okay.

796
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
So confused.

797
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,680
I'll just react when I like something.

798
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Trust in the cactus.

799
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Exactly.

800
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
That's what we should do.

801
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
Just don't worry about it.

802
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,640
You know, it kind of seems like it's like a prisoner's dilemma sort of thing.

803
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:04,360
I feel like even though like the optimal play is to like be very generous with resonations,

804
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,080
and then like other people will probably be generous with them with you, and then everyone

805
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,760
will mutually benefit.

806
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,080
I wonder if it would fall into the trap of like, people, nobody reacts to anyone because

807
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,960
they want to hoard all their bounty to themselves, but then everybody suffers.

808
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,960
Well, here's the thing about bounty.

809
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,960
It literally doesn't matter outside of social currency.

810
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,440
It literally only matters for bragging rights.

811
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,880
And so you're not going to be super hoarding with it.

812
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,640
And I mean, already evidently, everyone is reacting to everything way too much already.

813
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,760
Like literally, like literally every post I'm scrolling up has like the highest tier favorite

814
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
reaction, literally all of them.

815
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,640
In fact, let me see how much bounty I have right now.

816
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,960
Um, I got a cool $6,000 going on $7,000.

817
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
That's pretty good.

818
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,280
This is why YouTube took away the star rating thing and just replaced it with like and dislike

819
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,480
because people would only vote for five stars and one star.

820
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah, basically.

821
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Nobody was like, hmm, three and a half stars.

822
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
Yeah.

823
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,980
Well, none the less.

824
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Well, there you go.

825
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,960
Go investigate and be an outlaw.

826
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Yes.

827
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,080
Come and be an outlaw and roam the territory deserts of Arizona and try to avoid the sheriffs

828
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,480
trying to take you back to Fort Whipple.

829
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,120
It's a great grand adventure.

830
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
I am curious.

831
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
Right.

832
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
That does sound great.

833
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
What is the lore of the Lonesome Cactus?

834
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,840
What is his authority in this town?

835
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,280
The Lonesome Cactus is merely a Lonesome Cactus, who, you know, is able to assist in the development

836
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,240
of young independent content creators such as yourself for a small price, which may or

837
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,360
may not be your soul, which may or may not be your dignity or, you know, your mortal coil.

838
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
We'll have to wait and see.

839
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,040
We'll have to see what kind of deal this Lonesome Cactus is to us.

840
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,720
It slurps up mortal coils like spaghetti noodles.

841
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,520
Maybe one day, if enough of his new friends move out and start creating art, he won't

842
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,960
be so lonesome after all.

843
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Something tells...

844
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,960
You like it, though.

845
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,800
Well, I imagine that he's, like, recetti, so he can, like, burrow underground and, like,

846
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
move wherever he wants.

847
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,360
So if someone tries to come over and talk to him, like, outside of asking for roles,

848
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,040
he'll just, like, burrow underground and then walk away and just, like, go.

849
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,040
He's lonesome because he obliterated all the competition.

850
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Yeah, exactly.

851
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Well, that makes sense.

852
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,160
This guy was the original artist.

853
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,280
He created drawing.

854
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,920
Oh, maybe he did in fact obliterate all the competition, but he learned that, like, no,

855
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
no, no, this is no way to live.

856
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm lonesome now as a result of my misdeeds.

857
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
I was too powerful.

858
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,640
I need to encourage others to also be artists and foster community.

859
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,400
Do you think he dips his needles in ink to write?

860
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Ooh, yes, I do.

861
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,440
Ooh, he can draw so many things at once.

862
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Yeah.

863
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Do you think he's a piotic cactus?

864
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Do you think you could, like, bite into him and then you get, like, super high-yags?

865
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Yeah, exactly.

866
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
That'd be awesome.

867
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Yeah, I mean, that lobe on his head, I mean, that's weed, if ever there was weed.

868
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,600
Have you seen, oh God, I don't know if I want to change the topic, but I'm gonna talk about

869
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
it.

870
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
We're done with this one.

871
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
It's over.

872
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I was gonna talk about Pokemon.

873
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
I was gonna talk about Pokemon.

874
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Sure.

875
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Just go ahead.

876
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Have you seen it?

877
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Everyone click on the link and go there now because Quick Draw is actually cool now,

878
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,600
and the drawcast is actually cool now because it's not on the PC, it's a real thing.

879
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
We're actually doing it again.

880
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
It's actually alive again.

881
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
It's epic.

882
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
It's pretty epic.

883
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
It's online.

884
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,260
Episodes aren't being recorded as well.

885
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,760
Episodes and new shows are being conceived of and recorded, so, fucking, Quick Draw has

886
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,440
a crazy future.

887
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,960
So do you guys see the Pokemon news?

888
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
No.

889
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
I heard some of it.

890
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I missed all the details.

891
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Who fucking cares?

892
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Is it good?

893
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Is it bad?

894
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
It's kind of funny.

895
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
It's kind of funny.

896
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Wow.

897
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,000
Basically they're really, okay, I might be a little, the general idea is they're releasing

898
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,280
like DLC that has all the fucking Pokemon that they withheld from the first release.

899
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,720
Lemau, who could have possibly, who could have possibly guessed?

900
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,760
It's not all of them, but it's a bunch of them, as I understand it.

901
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,440
Who could have possibly guessed that they didn't need to withhold all those Pokemon?

902
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,520
They were just doing it to make more money.

903
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,240
What an absolute shock.

904
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,800
That is unfortunate.

905
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:07,040
I mean, it, this, oh god, it's so disgraceful that they did interviews and said like, no,

906
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,320
Only to immediately assume is the game is that it'd be like, huh, no, we were just trying.

907
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
It was a lie.

908
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,000
We're just trying to milk more out of you.

909
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,080
And like, honestly, I would respect it so much more if they had just said, yeah, we're

910
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,120
withholding it because we're going to release them as DLC.

911
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,380
They just did fucking admit it.

912
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,300
You fucking cowards.

913
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,520
Even worse though, because like they like had a different excuse after the technical

914
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,520
limitations.

915
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,740
They said, Oh for balance reasons.

916
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,960
You know, it's hard to balance so many Pokemon, but they're putting them in there.

917
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,760
So like, you had to have balanced them.

918
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Yeah.

919
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
You did all the work.

920
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Don't get me wrong.

921
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,800
I don't respect how weasely they seem to be.

922
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,940
However, all these things could be part of the decision that like, it takes more effort

923
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,140
to put more Pokemon in.

924
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
Okay, true.

925
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,140
Balance.

926
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,140
I mean, okay, sure.

927
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,540
That could be part of the thing.

928
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,060
And ultimately, you know, it takes more work to get more Pokemon in the game.

929
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,740
There's updated textures and it's shit to some degree.

930
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,980
So I mean, is it embarrassing?

931
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,980
Absolutely.

932
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,060
I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying they lied, okay?

933
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,220
I'm just saying, well, maybe I know.

934
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:17,060
I'm just saying, like, okay, obviously I wouldn't like it if they were gonna like, section

935
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,220
off, cordon off certain Pokemon and only give them with DLC.

936
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,620
I would never like that, but it wouldn't offend me if they hadn't like, lied about it.

937
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,820
I am not seeing a clear lie.

938
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,820
Maybe we just disagree on this.

939
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,420
They said it was for technical limitations and it's just not.

940
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
It's just not.

941
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,420
I think not.

942
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,420
It cannot possibly be that.

943
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,420
They kept changing their story.

944
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,700
Yes.

945
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,060
Also, and further evidences that apparently they changed their story.

946
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:47,900
I think, boy, I mean, I also think it's a terrible thing just generally.

947
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:55,820
But I think the argument if to play devil's advocate, stop, to play devil's advocate.

948
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,460
The argument is that they couldn't develop it in the time for technical.

949
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,580
It wasn't like it's impossible to port them over.

950
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,700
It's like they need to remake them and that's why it took so long and it took so long.

951
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,540
So that, you know, they have to get a Pokemon game out.

952
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,740
It's not good, but like, I think it's not technically a lie, but you should treat it

953
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,660
like one because it's fucking.

954
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,660
Okay.

955
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,660
Okay.

956
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,660
Well, all right.

957
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,140
So the Pokemon company is terrible now.

958
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,140
It's bad.

959
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,180
I, you know, you, you know what, okay, I don't, do we like Arlo?

960
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,060
I kind of, I sometimes I like Arlo.

961
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,260
I watched some Arlo videos about Pokemon.

962
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,260
He is Keto Ben.

963
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,260
He is pretty.

964
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,700
He's not full Keto, but he dabbles.

965
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
He's fine.

966
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
But he's fine.

967
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:45,580
Arlo will be destroyed by, when I, when I get like, you know, some red felt and I make

968
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,780
red man the puppet and he reviews games, Arlo will be dead within minutes.

969
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
That sounds good.

970
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,060
He did a bunch of videos about covering Sword and Shield.

971
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,060
He's fine.

972
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,060
Yeah.

973
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,060
He's fine.

974
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,380
He, but he did a bunch of videos covering Sword and Shield and he said some stuff that

975
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,380
really struck.

976
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,700
I was like, oh my God, he's onto something here.

977
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,180
And it was basically that like, Nintendo is like, I guess I just never thought about

978
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,180
this before.

979
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,500
I mean, every generation, they add like cool new features, but they take old good features

980
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
away.

981
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,940
Like they're not, they're obviously not just trying to make the series as good as it can

982
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,940
be.

983
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:27,060
The strategy is to add features to every generation and then take them away later so that every

984
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,420
generation has like certain things about it that only it has.

985
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,860
They're kind of creating like an illusion of progress by doing that.

986
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,660
No, it's not, it's not that it's, it's sort of the opposite.

987
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:45,380
It's like, okay, well yeah, Heart, Gold, Soul, Silver, that's the one with the Pokemon

988
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,380
that follow you.

989
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,620
Sword and Shield, that's the one with the Dynamaxing.

990
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,700
It's not, they're not, they're like deliberately not making progress and adding more stuff to

991
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,820
make the game better.

992
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,820
They're deliberately like, they add something and they take it away to make every generation,

993
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,100
such that every generation doesn't like obsolete the previous ones.

994
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,780
In Galar, it has to be side grades.

995
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,220
In other words, in other words, they don't want to make the games too good because it

996
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,900
would make their old games look worse by comparison.

997
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,660
And also it would set the bar too high.

998
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,540
Like I don't, why do they have to worry about depreciating value for stuff that is old?

999
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,580
I mean, it's not like fire red, green, being ugly, overshadow is really going to cause

1000
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,940
new problems for them, is it?

1001
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:30,900
Well maybe it's more just about not setting expectations too high or just, yeah, I don't

1002
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,900
know.

1003
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,740
Do you think, maybe they're not that concerned with sales of old games, I'm sure they make

1004
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,980
relatively less money on things like that.

1005
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,980
I kind of feel like a lot of this is a feature creep that, like if they had Megas, Anzi moves

1006
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,500
and Dynamax, then it's just a lot to do when you make new games.

1007
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,140
Well I wouldn't have added all of those things if they had kept the ones from when they started

1008
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,660
adding special delinquent.

1009
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,900
Like they could have, instead of doing Z moves, they could have just made more Megas.

1010
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,580
If that's what they were going to go with.

1011
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,580
Sure, sure.

1012
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,580
You're right.

1013
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,580
There's definitely flaws.

1014
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,580
It is definitely a marketing thing.

1015
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,780
Like, oh, the new Pokemon game, it's not just the same as the old one.

1016
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,220
We got this new thing that makes them different aside from more than new Pokemon.

1017
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,420
It's explicitly a native thing, Dynamaxing is only in Galar, can you Dynamax?

1018
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,340
So that certainly fits the pattern there.

1019
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,780
I don't know, I think they said I was watching the Arlo and he got the game and he was like,

1020
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,740
I haven't played a Pokemon game in like eight years.

1021
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,860
I didn't play any of the last three generations and he's like, he booted up Sword and Shield

1022
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,900
and he was like, oh my God, it's still the same?

1023
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,500
It hasn't changed that much?

1024
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
How disappointing?

1025
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,980
And I was like, yep, I'm kind of sick of it.

1026
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,580
I'm kind of fucking over it.

1027
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,580
It's bad.

1028
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,540
I feel like I decided this like 300 episodes ago on this very podcast.

1029
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,100
I know, but then someone else said it and I was mad all over again.

1030
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,180
Well then why don't you go watch that guy's video?

1031
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,860
No, to only watch this channel.

1032
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,300
I'm here to do reporting on what he said.

1033
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,340
Listen, I'm here to regurgitate content creators' videos for the mass market.

1034
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,900
I'm just, I'm only expressing all this because I strongly share the opinion and am upset

1035
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,820
about it and it bugs me and I don't like it.

1036
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,100
Did you see the new legendary or the new like mystical mythical Pokemon?

1037
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,260
I did see that.

1038
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,500
The one like the deer with like the giant ball on its head?

1039
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Hideous.

1040
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,740
I like that one.

1041
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,860
I actually like that one a lot.

1042
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,860
That's pretty funny.

1043
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,860
Okay.

1044
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:38,740
Such as with old Pokemon discussions is like, fuck Pokemon, fuck, they suck, but I kind

1045
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,740
of love them though.

1046
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,260
That's my thing to talk about.

1047
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,260
Yeah.

1048
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,860
This is, I think the thing, I mean, most people just buy Pokemon are like, oh good,

1049
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,900
the new one.

1050
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,900
I like Pokemon generically.

1051
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,900
I will buy this.

1052
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,900
That's most people.

1053
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,980
Anyway, he talks about Pokemon and how much they like or dislike Pokemon are literally

1054
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:01,140
the most fucking caveman brain dead sex of shit corpses on.

1055
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,140
Yeah.

1056
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,140
Speaking of which.

1057
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Speaking of which.

1058
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,140
And yes, I am talking about you.

1059
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,260
It just fucking, it just makes me so upset when I realize they're not trying to make

1060
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,260
a good game.

1061
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,460
That's not what they want to do.

1062
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
They don't give a shit.

1063
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,460
They don't care if it's good.

1064
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,100
Ah, it just has to be good enough.

1065
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:22,740
It's just the first gigantic thing that has been around for like decades.

1066
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,460
It's a lot of money tied to it.

1067
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,020
Like they've got to make, they've got to string it out for as long as possible.

1068
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,020
Think about what it means.

1069
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,140
If you want a good game, you go to a gamer that likes playing them.

1070
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,340
Like what is, what is the perfect Pokemon game?

1071
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,660
Like it's, it's probably, like what we'll get the most sales, it's probably not like

1072
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,580
kind of what we envision with like, I think these things that like fan hacks or whatever

1073
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,500
where they make it like really challenging.

1074
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,820
Maybe like a more interesting story.

1075
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,740
I'm not, I'm not even talking about challenge.

1076
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,740
I'm just talking about like, don't fucking gut your own games and like take out good features.

1077
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,380
Like they had a writable Pokemon in, in Pikachu, hey you Pikachu.

1078
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,460
They could have had it in Sword and Shield if they wanted to.

1079
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,460
They didn't.

1080
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,460
Why?

1081
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,100
Because it, because it doesn't matter.

1082
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,420
Like like including good features that people like, like that's not what it's about.

1083
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,260
It's just about like making the new one, making it different enough.

1084
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,340
And it doesn't matter if you, if you add or if you take away.

1085
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,340
It's all the same.

1086
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,820
It all comes out in the wash.

1087
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,340
I think we can all agree that does seem to be pushed and how it comes out.

1088
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,380
You know, the worst thing, obviously, obviously the worst thing is that they're successful

1089
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,340
because of them doing this.

1090
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:30,020
I'm sure this is like a calculate, you know, a calculation that has proved to be true every

1091
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,260
single time they do it.

1092
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,580
They still make lots of money and from all the games being slightly different, but none

1093
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,540
of them being like straight upgrades, except the remakes, because that's an opportunity

1094
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,660
to hype up, like selling a really old game that nobody would potentially buy on the old

1095
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,660
console.

1096
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,740
Although I wonder if your Omega Sapphire and Rubies are actually better than the original

1097
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,380
because they're filled with, I mean, I didn't play them, seems like they're filled with

1098
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,380
bloat and bullshit.

1099
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,460
I don't know if I could be wrong.

1100
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
I think so.

1101
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,460
I haven't played all of it.

1102
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,140
I've played it in a little bit because of nostalgia, but it's like.

1103
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,020
I mean, Shea Mei's seven hour review of Pokemon Omega Root.

1104
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,580
I don't remember if he ends up deciding that the remake is better or worse than the original.

1105
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,740
Was it kind of a toss-up though?

1106
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,980
Was there even, like, it wasn't clear?

1107
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,780
Because Heart Gold is, like, basically straight up better than Gold and Silver.

1108
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,700
He definitely had some things that really annoyed him about the remake.

1109
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,140
I don't remember if he ever goes so far as to be like, the remake is worse.

1110
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,260
I just forget it's been a while.

1111
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,260
Fair enough.

1112
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,740
Oh, oh, oh, my old bone lake when I think about Pokemon.

1113
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
Huh?

1114
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,060
Oh, I'm just letting the audience know.

1115
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,060
There.

1116
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,060
No more Pokemon.

1117
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,140
You could skip to this part of the video to skip the Pokemon discussion.

1118
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,260
Oh, God.

1119
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
Yeah.

1120
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,260
Okay.

1121
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,260
Well, I'm sorry, everybody.

1122
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,260
Oh, jeez.

1123
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,340
Hey, I've got a tangent to say, which is just out.

1124
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,500
Guys, let me tell you about a little guy that everybody loves named Jordan Peterson.

1125
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Oh, God.

1126
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
No, God.

1127
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
Okay, no, no, no, no.

1128
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Okay, all right.

1129
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Why?

1130
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,020
The story at the point is I cleaned my room, guys, therefore I'm up right now.

1131
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,020
I did it.

1132
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
You know what?

1133
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,260
Hey, you guys heard this last name, Mari Kondo?

1134
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,260
Yeah, you could live.

1135
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,260
Oh, yeah.

1136
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,260
That's a queen.

1137
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,260
That's a queen.

1138
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,260
You fucking sex.

1139
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,260
You know.

1140
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,980
I mean, I want Mari Kondo and Jordan Peterson to, like, have children for the ultimate cleaning

1141
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
machine.

1142
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,500
She seems like she'd be a fun mom.

1143
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Too bad she's already...

1144
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
Imagine this.

1145
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
She's already spent 99% of her eggs.

1146
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,100
I guess that's what become a great meme.

1147
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,100
That is a great meme.

1148
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
It is.

1149
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,100
It is a great meme.

1150
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,100
I can't remember.

1151
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
I made a really epic joke.

1152
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
Okay, whatever.

1153
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,100
You just summed it up with that.

1154
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,460
Point is, me and Michelle have just been cleaning, and I just got to say, it is certainly

1155
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,220
a truism that when your house is dirty and then you spend a while cleaning it, it just

1156
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,740
feels better afterward.

1157
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,240
So highly recommended.

1158
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,240
Do it.

1159
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Funny enough.

1160
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Do it.

1161
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Live in a clean place.

1162
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
I also clean my room.

1163
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,060
Not entirely, but, like, yeah, I put a lot of my stuff away and I clean up a lot of space.

1164
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:55,380
I was inspired to do this because I made a genius-level purchasing decision.

1165
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,380
Let me explain what's the most exciting thing in my life right now.

1166
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,380
So my room.

1167
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,620
Nate, have you been to my room?

1168
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,460
No, but we did see that epic room tour that Zenn Huckstable made for Michelle upon request.

1169
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,460
I never retweeted that.

1170
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,460
I'm so fucking mad.

1171
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,460
What are you doing there, buddy?

1172
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,960
I can't believe I wasn't there for Christmas.

1173
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
It makes me so upset.

1174
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
There was so much shit going down.

1175
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
That is too bad.

1176
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,540
It was sad because Nate and Michelle had to go, like, right away.

1177
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:22,180
Like, me and Tom and Zenn hung out and had anti-pasto platters.

1178
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,680
We were very sad together.

1179
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,680
It was a bummer.

1180
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,680
It had to be done.

1181
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
We had a pretty good time.

1182
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,680
But anyway.

1183
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,680
Next time.

1184
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,680
Next time.

1185
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
Yeah.

1186
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:36,220
But anyway, my room has, like, you know, it's got, like, a little sort of alcove corner

1187
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,220
to it.

1188
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,660
It's only, like, maybe three feet wide and it sticks back, like, four or five feet into

1189
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,380
the wall and it's got, like, a little angled half ceiling.

1190
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,660
It's just, like, a little, like, nook that I just keep, like, shelves over there with

1191
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,420
books and stuff on them.

1192
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,420
Sure.

1193
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,700
And so I purchased a tension rod.

1194
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,700
You know what that is?

1195
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
I don't.

1196
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,700
I don't.

1197
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,060
It's, like, a metal rod that's, like, spring-loaded and you can put it.

1198
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,120
You basically just wedge it between two walls and you can use it to, like, put up a shower

1199
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
curtain or something.

1200
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,120
Yeah.

1201
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,440
So I bought one of those and then I got a bunch of coat hangers and my closet was stuffed

1202
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,920
with thing and now I have a rod because, like, my closet is, like, it's, like, a little,

1203
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,200
like, low half closet.

1204
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,520
It's only, like, a couple feet high.

1205
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,960
I have, like, a little, like, a long, horizontal, low closet.

1206
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,840
So now I hung up this tension rod.

1207
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,280
So now I have all my hangable clothes over on the nook hung up.

1208
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,460
And also they form sort of a little makeshift curtain that I have to sort of part to get

1209
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,460
into the nook.

1210
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,500
It's, like, in the adult section of an old, like, DVD shop.

1211
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,660
And also, because I just went to the garment district and I bought a bunch of cool items

1212
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,780
from the women's section, Lamal.

1213
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:51,660
And one of them was a sweater that has, like, a cool, like, skeleton ribcage pattern on

1214
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,660
the front.

1215
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
Whoa.

1216
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,740
And I hung that on the front of the rack.

1217
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,560
So now I have this, like, cool skeleton pattern sweater prominently displayed in my room.

1218
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,000
And it makes me feel pretty edgy.

1219
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
What a life upgrade.

1220
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,920
Can we get a picture of this set up, perhaps?

1221
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
Yeah, please.

1222
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
You want it right now?

1223
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
I mean, hey, take your time, but at some point.

1224
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
Yeah, I know.

1225
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
I'll take one right now.

1226
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,360
Your room is so fucking small, Ben, that I can't even imagine this device, this major

1227
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,920
operation taking up any space inside of it.

1228
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Is it that small?

1229
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
Yeah.

1230
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,920
I don't know.

1231
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,920
It is.

1232
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
It's pretty small.

1233
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,920
It's pretty, you know, okay.

1234
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:30,340
The L-Cove makes it, like, technically, I think, normal size, but, like, it feels much

1235
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,380
smaller because the L-Cove is so, like, jetted off to the side that it doesn't really feel

1236
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,380
like it's part of anything.

1237
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,540
Maybe I missed this part, but, like, what's the gain here?

1238
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,220
I'm not quite understanding the benefit of this set up.

1239
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,900
Well, I created new storage space to hang my clothes in.

1240
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,460
And also, I just like that it's like a little curtain, a little hangable clothes curtain

1241
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
in front of my book nook.

1242
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,920
All right, if anyone wants to know how to visualize Ben's room, here's how you do it.

1243
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,720
You get a cheese wheel, you make a slice of cheese from the cheese wheel, then at the

1244
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,640
broad base of it, here's this computer at the tiny little sliver a little in, there's

1245
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,280
just, like, a mattress on the floor, and that's Ben's room.

1246
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,080
That's, oh, and then a bunch of caffeine pills and, like, vape cartridges just scattered

1247
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,640
across every single place.

1248
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Hell yeah, dude.

1249
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
That's the life.

1250
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
Dirt cheap E-Fox.

1251
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Dirt cheap E-Fox.

1252
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
Dirt cheap E-Fox.

1253
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,100
No, everyone.

1254
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,380
Channel Marie Kondo.

1255
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,700
You're perfectly politically neutral, cleanliness individual.

1256
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,700
Be her.

1257
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,700
It brings you joy.

1258
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,780
And, you know, Michelle, I said this before, but, like, we've been trying to just get rid

1259
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,580
of shit we don't need because only keep things that spark joy.

1260
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,460
If you've got a bunch of crap, there's, like, a bunch of boxes that are, like, anime figurine

1261
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:49,220
boxes, I think to myself, oh, I might want those boxes one day to pack up my anime figurines.

1262
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,660
You think I will ever use those?

1263
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,660
No.

1264
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,660
You should get rid of them.

1265
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,360
They're a waste of space and a waste of time.

1266
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,920
Bigger space to live in will make you happier, so do that.

1267
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Wait, you do that to point your anime figurines?

1268
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,000
Bigger place to put incense and candles to pray to Jesus.

1269
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That's right.

1270
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
We could have a whole shrine to Saint Jude or whatever.

1271
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,320
We could have a tired chapel in your house if you just cleaned up your fucking room,

1272
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
Nate.

1273
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
You could literally get a mast.

1274
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
I posted the room picture.

1275
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,200
Where's your tablet, Ben?

1276
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,760
The tablet is, it's, okay, I'm actually lying on my bed right now and I have the tablet

1277
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,820
on the floor in front of my bed.

1278
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,820
What?

1279
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,820
Yeah.

1280
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,980
Oh, that incredible, look at that, look at that Nuzlocke team poster there.

1281
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,480
Yeah, but that's good stuff.

1282
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,980
Nat blasphemous, yeah.

1283
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,140
But yes, that rack is great.

1284
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,140
I'm sure that makes space.

1285
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:39,780
And then there's Nobby's Nalacacum art over small, small prints right next to the rod.

1286
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,780
Wait, Nobby?

1287
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,780
Yeah.

1288
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
Um, Ben.

1289
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,780
That little postcard.

1290
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,780
What?

1291
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,780
I drew that.

1292
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:47,780
Is that wrong?

1293
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,940
No, you fucking moron.

1294
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Not that one.

1295
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
The other one.

1296
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,960
You fucking dipshit.

1297
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,280
You piece of shit.

1298
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,280
You motherfucker.

1299
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Get the fuck out of here.

1300
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I don't even see it.

1301
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
I think I don't know.

1302
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Oh, I see it.

1303
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Oh, way in the back there.

1304
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Way in the back.

1305
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,800
Yes, yours is under the picture of Rando from Lisa, indeed.

1306
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,960
I mean, you mean can man, right?

1307
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Yeah.

1308
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,960
That's right.

1309
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,960
Yeah, okay.

1310
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,960
I mean, can man.

1311
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Fuck can man.

1312
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,480
Let's talk about, is that pink or is that like green and purple over there?

1313
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,700
My original Spike Cosplay that I sewed myself and I revealed fabulously a burning thing.

1314
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:28,340
No, that is, that is, while I was at the fucking garment district, I just bought a green and

1315
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,940
a purple handkerchief because I thought they would be cool to add to outfits at, is it

1316
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:39,340
because you like green and purple, green and purple, you know, like weed at RFC KCon.

1317
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,500
I was cleaning out my room because that's the way I want to say, that's why I went to

1318
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Garment District.

1319
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,560
So I went to Garment District to buy one pants that fit because I didn't have any and two

1320
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,080
cool outfits to wear to RFC KCon and I got that skeleton sweater and I got a cool like

1321
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,520
hood that makes me look like some kind of like cultist and, and it's pretty great.

1322
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,200
And I got them all in the women's section, women's clothes are better.

1323
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
They're more interesting.

1324
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
Yeah.

1325
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,200
True.

1326
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
When they can fit.

1327
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,680
I found, I found so many great plaid shirts in the women's section that were like beautiful

1328
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,640
colors and I was like, I love these so much.

1329
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,900
I want to wear them, but they were all, even the ones that were large, even like large

1330
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,460
size ones were like too small and didn't fit on my body.

1331
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,460
They're like cut differently.

1332
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,460
And I cried.

1333
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
Yeah.

1334
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
Yeah.

1335
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,460
I cried.

1336
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,460
I cried.

1337
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,460
That's it.

1338
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,460
It's the end of the story.

1339
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,100
Hey, hey, viewer, listen, hey, audience member, listen the fuck up today.

1340
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:35,660
As you're reading this, as you're listening to this right now, the 17th of January, 2020

1341
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:41,100
is the first day of RFC KCon six and tune over to my channel, like the RFC K channel or something.

1342
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,160
Because there's going to be mad live streams.

1343
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,160
What is the PCP release?

1344
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,160
Like what time?

1345
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
Friday.

1346
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Friday at 2 PM.

1347
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
2 PM.

1348
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Okay.

1349
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,280
During this time, literally stop listening to this episode right now and tab over to

1350
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,960
real life gang violence, which is happening right now in the RFC K channel.

1351
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,520
Go there right now, right now, right now, right now, right fucking now.

1352
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,560
Click on the link in the description.

1353
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,560
Show notes.

1354
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,560
There you go.

1355
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,560
It'll be the X.

1356
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,640
Oh, by the way, I want to say that I was cleaning my room because a family member is going

1357
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:15,420
to be living in my room while I'm away at college and we're going to switch out.

1358
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,540
And so I've been cleaning out my room and I've been trying to make it less, you know,

1359
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:24,380
I'm trying to make it more presentable to the people and more easy to mold in their

1360
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,380
own.

1361
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,380
So I've been taking down all my posters.

1362
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,380
I've just been trying to make it as, you know, as base and stock and diplomatic as humanly

1363
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,380
possible.

1364
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,540
And I've been shifting through all of my possessions because I had forgotten that I had possessions

1365
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,220
because I took like literally nothing to college and my room had just been completely

1366
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,220
bare.

1367
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,560
Like there's basically no furniture inside of it.

1368
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,560
There's literally nothing.

1369
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,160
You look at my roommate's side and he has a bunch of posters and he has a bunch of

1370
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,160
like knick-knacks and stuff.

1371
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,440
And look over at mine and mine's like a bed, a desk, a computer.

1372
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,440
And that is literally it.

1373
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,440
There's nothing else there.

1374
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,840
I'm like, oh my God, I have like books.

1375
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,120
I have like a globe.

1376
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
I have all these things.

1377
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,520
I want to take it all back.

1378
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,720
Oh, I missed having furniture in my room.

1379
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,720
It's cool.

1380
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,920
And it's pretty good, right?

1381
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,720
You got any shit on your walls at your dorm?

1382
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,320
No, I have literally nothing on my, on my wall.

1383
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,180
Because that's, that's sad.

1384
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,180
That's really sad.

1385
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,780
There's a legendary clip you should hear, Munchy, when it's a flashback in Metal Gear

1386
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:22,660
Solid 2, when Ryden is fucking around, he's talking to Rose, and Rose describes the legendary

1387
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,100
event where she first entered his bedroom, like he's at an apartment, it's fine, but

1388
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,100
then she enters the bedroom.

1389
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,540
And he's, by the way, he's a war orphan, a child soldier, and he walks into his room

1390
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,100
and he's just, there's nothing there but a bed.

1391
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:41,280
And she takes this as a big yikes, as a big oof, and it makes him very spooky and scary.

1392
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,120
So just so you know, this is how you are perceived by the people in your life, whether they say

1393
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,120
it or not.

1394
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,120
That's really fine.

1395
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
Yeah, okay, great, great.

1396
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,120
Having, okay, listen.

1397
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,120
You are a child soldier of the PCP, so it's fitting, frankly.

1398
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,760
This is a pretty human core thing to say, and we're gonna kill me if you want.

1399
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,640
And I'm not like a su, up until very recently, I've been very anti-possession, very anti-like

1400
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,020
buying things that isn't an experience and slash or food.

1401
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,820
And that's all been cool and, you know, buying consumables, I guess, is alright, is like

1402
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,700
a philosophical outlook.

1403
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:15,820
But there is something to be said, I have this tiny little tiki statue right next to

1404
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:20,580
my computer, and this little tiki statue gives me joy whenever I look at him.

1405
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,860
So maybe, maybe kids, when you go out in the town with your friends, don't spend all of

1406
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:29,500
your money on cheeseburgers, maybe buy a tiki statue instead.

1407
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,120
I like little things like that.

1408
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:38,560
I still have, I think it was from Radcon 3, oh no, it would have been from the Barone

1409
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,960
Con.

1410
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:48,720
One of the times where we met up, I still have that squishy Kirby from, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1411
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,480
And he's been on my desk and every so often, I squish him and I'm like, ah, memories.

1412
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,320
And also, it just is a nice cute thing.

1413
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,480
I am way too into like keeping things.

1414
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,700
I really don't need, not in just like a, you know, a whatever sense, but if it has like

1415
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:09,580
a historical value to me, I have like a drawer, like near my desk, that's just full of like

1416
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,940
historic artifacts and I can pull it out and there's like plane trips that I like, like

1417
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:18,140
plane tickets to places where I went and I have like little like knickknacks and stuff.

1418
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,980
I keep, I keep all my receipts.

1419
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,180
I don't know why.

1420
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,020
It's not like I need them.

1421
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,740
I just like, oh, I remember going to that restaurant and getting that thing and costing

1422
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
exactly that much.

1423
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Yeah.

1424
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,240
I have a ton of movie stubs and stuff like that where it's like, oh dude, remember when

1425
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,560
I saw the emoji movie?

1426
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,560
I remember that.

1427
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
What a great time.

1428
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,080
What a fucking godforsaken night.

1429
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
It's pretty awesome.

1430
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,080
I really, you know, hold on.

1431
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,080
I'm going to rustle through.

1432
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,080
One second.

1433
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,560
Let me, let me pull out the first thing that I see over here.

1434
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,840
Oh, oh, oh.

1435
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,200
Any day now, chief.

1436
01:05:52,200 --> 01:06:01,300
I have a breeze card, which is the Georgia Atlanta, like public transport.

1437
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,900
It's the Atlanta shitty version of a Charlie card.

1438
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Yeah.

1439
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,900
It's the Atlanta.

1440
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,900
That was a nightmare.

1441
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:07,900
Dude.

1442
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,900
Okay.

1443
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,900
Getting from the plane to your house.

1444
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:14,900
Such a pale, such a pale ghost of an imitation of the, of the, of the MBTA.

1445
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,900
Yeah.

1446
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:16,900
What a fucking nightmare.

1447
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Okay.

1448
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,900
One last note about clean your house and we can go to wherever Nate is dying to talk

1449
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,900
about.

1450
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,160
Cause I know I can hear it in his fucking voice while cleaning out my room.

1451
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:31,640
I found a mysterious artifact, which was not its original location, which means that someone

1452
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:38,720
must have moved it, which means that I'm a ghost now because it was my, you know, like

1453
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,720
baby shoes never worn.

1454
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,480
It was my fleshlight never used.

1455
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,240
And I bought it in a tent spit of shame and dysphoria.

1456
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,060
And I decided that it was not the kind of man that I wanted to be, but I already bought

1457
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,060
it.

1458
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,060
So there's nothing I could do about it.

1459
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,060
And so I put it away.

1460
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,060
I put it away.

1461
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:58,660
Like, like, like, like, like the Ark of the Covenant sealing it away amongst of my many

1462
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:04,060
artifacts, never to be taken out and used again until I found it and not its real location.

1463
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,660
So everyone knows, everyone fucking knows that I was once a coomer and that that side

1464
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:13,700
of me is brazen to the world and to a fully, you know, dismiss myself from it.

1465
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,920
I offered to my friend Kyle on New Year's and he did a shot out of my fleshlight and

1466
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,920
it was incredible.

1467
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Ew.

1468
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,920
That's so disgusting.

1469
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,920
That's so far.

1470
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,920
I saw that.

1471
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,920
It was clean.

1472
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
It was unused, bro.

1473
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
It was clean.

1474
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
It was cringed, dude.

1475
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,920
It's cringed.

1476
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,920
On a conceptual level, that is repulsive.

1477
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,920
Listen, I hate absolutely everything about that.

1478
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,920
Me too.

1479
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,920
No.

1480
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,920
Dude, I fucking hate you, man.

1481
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,920
Yeah.

1482
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,920
Nah, bra.

1483
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
Nah, bra.

1484
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Nah, bra.

1485
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,920
You gotta get the fuck outta here.

1486
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,380
I'm gonna put this in the description.

1487
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,380
Hold on.

1488
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,380
All right.

1489
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,460
Wait, what are you gonna put?

1490
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,460
What are you gonna put?

1491
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,460
Ew.

1492
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,460
No.

1493
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,460
Bro.

1494
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,460
It's a video of him doing it.

1495
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,460
No.

1496
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,460
Watch it.

1497
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,460
Kyle, shout out.

1498
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,460
Shout to you, Kyle.

1499
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,460
Oh, it's horrible.

1500
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,460
No, it's great.

1501
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,460
Oh, it's heinous.

1502
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,460
Why?

1503
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,460
Why is it heinous?

1504
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,460
Ew.

1505
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,460
Look into it, Ben.

1506
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,460
Look into it, Ben.

1507
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,460
See, there's a reason I see people around him.

1508
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,460
I see people covering his eyes and not acknowledging it.

1509
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1510
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,460
Please stop.

1511
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,460
Bruh.

1512
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,460
I don't know why.

1513
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,460
This really fucking bugs me out.

1514
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,460
I hate it so much.

1515
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,460
Ben, do you want the flashlight?

1516
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,460
Yes, please.

1517
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,460
Do you actually?

1518
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,460
I'll literally give it to you.

1519
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,460
I don't care.

1520
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,460
No, I do not want the flashlight.

1521
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,460
Why?

1522
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,460
Why?

1523
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,460
Does anyone hate why?

1524
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,460
Oh, oh, wait.

1525
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,460
To drink out of, of course.

1526
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,460
Oh, my God.

1527
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,460
Oh, my God.

1528
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,460
The perfect idea.

1529
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:31,460
Guys, an auction, PCP fans, if you want my flashlight, then make the highest bidding

1530
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,460
in the comments and then I will follow up with you.

1531
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,460
You got to bring it to RAGCon4, dude.

1532
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,460
You got to bring it to RAGCon4.

1533
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,460
Yeah.

1534
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,460
Oh, my God.

1535
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,460
We got to have the group.

1536
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,460
The group fuck.

1537
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,460
This is actually happening.

1538
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,460
No.

1539
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,460
Okay, guys.

1540
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,460
No.

1541
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,460
Put dollar sign, you know, your bid in the comments and I will follow up after, like,

1542
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,460
a week.

1543
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,460
I will follow up with the highest bidder.

1544
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,460
Here you go.

1545
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,460
This is a munchy thing.

1546
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,460
Not a me thing.

1547
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,460
Just no.

1548
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,460
No, this is the same thing.

1549
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,460
No, I actually discussed this with Nate previous to the show and he begged me to do it.

1550
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,460
This is actually just a cover.

1551
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,460
This is actually his flashlight.

1552
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,460
Yeah, we're doing a good cop, bad cop routine right now.

1553
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,460
Give him the salty and the sweet.

1554
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,460
You know, that, you know, there you go.

1555
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,460
Just like the french fry milkshakes.

1556
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,460
There it is.

1557
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,460
Yeah.

1558
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,460
Bringing it all the way back around.

1559
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,460
Sadly, if you cross section the flashlight, you won't get the delicious ice cream, delicious

1560
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,460
french fries.

1561
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,460
You'll just get rum and coke and cum and blood and sweat.

1562
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,460
If you cross section the flashlight, you won't get the delicious ice cream, delicious french

1563
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,460
fries.

1564
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,460
You'll just get rum and coke and cum and blood and sweat.

1565
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:32,460
Which is equally delicious, in my opinion.

1566
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,300
I was looking in my drawer.

1567
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,460
The first thing I picked out was a Chipotle thing.

1568
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,460
Oh!

1569
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,460
On the back though.

1570
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,460
Front rack on three.

1571
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,460
Let me try.

1572
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,220
I don't think there's like a date on it.

1573
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,220
It was 750.

1574
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,460
It was a chicken ball and my host was Soraya.

1575
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,460
The fuck is a chicken ball?

1576
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,460
Chicken ball.

1577
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,460
I don't know.

1578
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,460
It's a rice ball.

1579
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,460
Oh wait.

1580
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,460
No, no.

1581
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,460
Here's the date.

1582
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,460
The eighth.

1583
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,460
All right.

1584
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,460
It's American, I think.

1585
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,460
Yeah, yeah.

1586
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,460
Baltimore.

1587
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,460
Okay.

1588
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:05,460
So the fourth of October 2019 is the eighth month.

1589
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,460
That don't line up.

1590
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,460
Wait.

1591
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,460
That was when we did the meetup at Digi's Place, right?

1592
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,460
No?

1593
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,460
Am I wrong?

1594
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,460
No, no.

1595
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,460
This is August 2019.

1596
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,460
This is BronyCon.

1597
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,460
This is BronyCon.

1598
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,460
This must be BronyCon.

1599
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1600
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,460
When are we going to Chipotle BronyCon?

1601
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,460
At 4.30 p.m.

1602
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,460
Maybe he went without you, Munchie.

1603
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,460
No, we definitely did.

1604
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Some people do things without you.

1605
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,460
I remember.

1606
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,460
I remember.

1607
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,460
No, I remember we went out to BronyCon.

1608
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,460
I remember being there with, uh, uh, Cassie was there and I remember we were with the

1609
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
little bird.

1610
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Wait.

1611
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,460
I remember Banana was there.

1612
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,460
Was I there?

1613
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,460
Oh my God.

1614
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,460
It's not that deep.

1615
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,460
He went to Chipotle Munchie.

1616
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,460
There's no analysis required.

1617
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,460
No, no, without me?

1618
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,460
Without me?

1619
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,460
I'm sure you were there.

1620
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,460
I think it was a whole big group.

1621
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,460
Yeah, we went with a whole big group.

1622
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,460
Yeah.

1623
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,460
Like, we sat on the table.

1624
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,460
This is radically an act that we're really tall.

1625
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,460
What were you doing at the time?

1626
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,460
I was doing partwheels.

1627
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,460
I don't remember what.

1628
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Oh, was I printing out Slime Corp stuff?

1629
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,460
Yes, that's it.

1630
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,460
I think that's it.

1631
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,460
You were printing out Slime Corp, but you missed on to Chipotle.

1632
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,460
No, no, no.

1633
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,960
That was something else because I remember, I remember, we went to Chipotle on the last

1634
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,960
day.

1635
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,780
We went to Chipotle on the last day right after we closed the ceremonies and then we came

1636
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:14,460
back when we got MAP and we got, we saw MAP and we saw Ice Cold Water Guy and he was

1637
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,460
awesome.

1638
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,460
Right before that.

1639
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,460
I remember now.

1640
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,460
It's all coming back to me.

1641
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,460
Thank God we solved this.

1642
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,460
It's what my cue marks are telling me.

1643
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,460
Sounds reasonable.

1644
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,460
You see?

1645
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
You see how cool that is?

1646
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,460
Like a stupid fucking receipt brought all those memories back.

1647
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,460
That actually is pretty cool.

1648
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,460
I suppose that's true.

1649
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:32,460
It's fucking awesome.

1650
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:38,300
It says on the back, if you'd like a chance at free Chipotle, you should take our survey.

1651
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Nuff said.

1652
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,300
Okay.

1653
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Nuff said.

1654
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,580
You've said enough already.

1655
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,580
No need for more.

1656
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:47,100
I can't answer the survey actually.

1657
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,100
But I want free.

1658
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,780
So anyway guys, about an anime that I saw recently.

1659
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,340
No, no, no, no, no.

1660
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,540
This is a shitty anime.

1661
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,540
All right.

1662
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:03,060
Transition, transition to, let's talk about what a nightmare experience it was just yesterday

1663
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,660
and the day before and whatever.

1664
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:09,940
Just grinding out these bureaucratic details about Radcon stuff that's now like done.

1665
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:14,060
I just wanted to spend a few minutes perhaps to just be like, holy shit.

1666
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:20,180
That was like one of the most grueling meetings I've had in my fucking life and it was so

1667
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,540
long and it, sure, it was profitable.

1668
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:29,580
It was fruitful in the end, but it was a true nightmare and I had a headache and my body

1669
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,940
was in shitty condition and I didn't get to go to the gym and also tensions got raised

1670
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,540
and people were mean and it hurt my feelings.

1671
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,540
What?

1672
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:39,540
No one was mean.

1673
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,140
What the fuck is this shit about?

1674
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:47,220
I may have sounded silly, but I was really low on sleep and cranky and like not holding

1675
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,900
back in any, like, I was just sort of like the whole time.

1676
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,900
All right.

1677
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,900
All right.

1678
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,900
Now I'm going to get mean, Nate.

1679
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,900
I'm going to fucking push you down.

1680
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,900
I'm going to pick you up and I'm going to put you down.

1681
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,900
Sure.

1682
01:12:58,900 --> 01:12:59,900
That was it.

1683
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,900
That was the extent of what I was going to do.

1684
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Oh, that was it.

1685
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,900
Okay.

1686
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,900
All right.

1687
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:04,900
Well, fair enough.

1688
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,900
No, nothing to get into too much.

1689
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,900
Okay.

1690
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,660
But let me quickly take a time to shit talk perhaps the worst actor in this whole endeavor,

1691
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,780
which is as you, it's did you, bro.

1692
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,460
I mean, this motherfucker, right?

1693
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,220
We're working for hours on this.

1694
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,780
He fucking strolls into the chat.

1695
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,700
He's like, ah, just figured out guys and we're like, uh, okay.

1696
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,700
And here we go.

1697
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,220
Spaying our entire fucking several days working on it.

1698
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,900
And he just comes in and this fucking comment in the chat was, yeah, I'm calling you out.

1699
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,580
Did you piece of fucking shit?

1700
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:35,780
He was like, wow, you guys are really still meeting after six hours?

1701
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,220
Oh, what the fuck guys?

1702
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:43,700
Which by the way, translation that that call it was just, wow, I can't believe you guys

1703
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,340
are means to after six hours.

1704
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,340
How that's like not even that different than my emphasis.

1705
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,780
That's like basically the same meaning.

1706
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,580
I just put a silly voice on it.

1707
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,580
True.

1708
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,100
It's just so fucking disrespectful of the effort we're putting in.

1709
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,180
These things matter.

1710
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,380
They were important things being discussed.

1711
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,380
Okay.

1712
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,380
Okay.

1713
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,380
What a fucking asshole.

1714
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,380
Jesus Christ.

1715
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,380
Am I wrong?

1716
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,380
Am I fucking wrong?

1717
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,380
And he thinks that we could just do it wherever.

1718
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,380
Probably.

1719
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,380
Okay.

1720
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,980
Not literally wherever, but I'm sure he just trusts us.

1721
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,580
Well, I think he thinks it's probably less effort than it is.

1722
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,860
And I think that he thinks that, you know, whatever we come up with, we'll be fine for

1723
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,860
him.

1724
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,820
I think someone has to come up with those things.

1725
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,460
No, no, the perception of what I think, you know, Digi, if you're listening to this,

1726
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,100
I hope I'm not putting words into your mouth, but the perception I think is happening here.

1727
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:33,660
It's like we are arguing over our ideal houses, not like coming up with houses to then decide

1728
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,060
upon.

1729
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,580
It's like we are all are coming at this and like he doesn't have to have a stake in

1730
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,060
which house specifically we go to.

1731
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,220
So anything is fine with him.

1732
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,460
Only he actually did have huge preferences for some of the houses over others.

1733
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,580
So actually he did have some pretty strong feelings about which ones.

1734
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,580
So it's not like that's really totally true.

1735
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580
Oh, well.

1736
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,580
Is Digi brah?

1737
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,580
Yeah.

1738
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,580
It's fine.

1739
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,580
It's fine.

1740
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,980
Don't worry about it.

1741
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,980
Okay.

1742
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,980
All right.

1743
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:07,060
So Digi cares about all the details less than most of us and he's just by disposition.

1744
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,060
It's true.

1745
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,220
He's less detailed concerned than somebody like me at least.

1746
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,300
It's like I get it.

1747
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,100
I get it.

1748
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,500
But just shut up and let us do it.

1749
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:22,660
But just to specifically laugh at how fucking long we've been working.

1750
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,980
Technically laugh in the comment he wrote.

1751
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,700
Like you read that into it, I think.

1752
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,540
You were like going insane over this like two like a message long paragraph that he

1753
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,540
wrote.

1754
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,540
It was like a one message long.

1755
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,540
It was like one sentence.

1756
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,540
It was one sentence.

1757
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,540
He was like, haha.

1758
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,540
Wow.

1759
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,540
Oh, okay.

1760
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,540
Exact quote.

1761
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,540
Exact quote.

1762
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:42,540
Digi.

1763
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:43,540
Yeah.

1764
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,540
Damn.

1765
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,540
Have y'all been mean for six hours?

1766
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,540
Indeed.

1767
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,540
Indeed.

1768
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,780
But I mean, this is one day out of several days.

1769
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:55,900
He's just, he's just, you know, surprised, you know, this usually doesn't happen.

1770
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:00,980
And so he's surprised and he's, you know, he's just voicing that, you know, there's

1771
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:01,980
no direction.

1772
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,980
Okay.

1773
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:03,980
Here's the difference.

1774
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,980
Here's the difference.

1775
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:11,380
If I was getting paid more than Digi for this work, I wouldn't care.

1776
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,900
But I'm not because we're already likely to barely break even.

1777
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,300
So I just won't.

1778
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,220
So why exactly is this like, why am I doing any of this?

1779
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,700
What benefit do I have by putting in more effort than people who aren't literally nothing?

1780
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,700
Oh, great.

1781
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,700
That seems like a good use of my time.

1782
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,700
See what I'm saying?

1783
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,700
Yes.

1784
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,700
Okay.

1785
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,700
Okay.

1786
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:46,340
But, you know, world peace, you know, love among brothers, kumbaya, yoga, you know, meditate.

1787
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,300
Let's just say, let's just say where we all meet up to Red Con.

1788
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,900
Where's your yoga skills now?

1789
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,300
You're losing your composure.

1790
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,500
Control your anger, Nate.

1791
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,500
Control your anger.

1792
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,500
I feel this is a healthy challenge.

1793
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,500
Do a yoga.

1794
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,500
Do a yoga.

1795
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,500
Downward dog.

1796
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:03,500
Let's just say that when we finally meet, we'll be six, but we will leave as five.

1797
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
Oh, no.

1798
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,500
That's true.

1799
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,940
I need to get more choice Digi images, because the one from Red Con 3 where he's down the

1800
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:14,300
Isle of Toys R Us and he's looking at me menacingly, that is literally the best thing to come out

1801
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,700
of an entirety of Red Con 3.

1802
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,700
So we have to get more shit like that.

1803
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,700
That is a good one.

1804
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,700
No doubt about it.

1805
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,300
No doubt about it.

1806
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:25,240
We should do that thing where we build like a Digi Sandman instead of a snowman and kill

1807
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,740
him as well.

1808
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,540
That's giving him too much respect to even give him that.

1809
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,700
I mean, why?

1810
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,700
Because he's more important?

1811
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,700
No.

1812
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,700
Fuck that.

1813
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,700
Fuck that guy.

1814
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,700
You are.

1815
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,700
This bridge is burned.

1816
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,700
Fuck that guy.

1817
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,700
It's all coming out.

1818
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:39,700
It's all coming out.

1819
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,700
I hate this guy.

1820
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:46,180
He's a real piece of shit, you know, just fuck him, man, just fuck.

1821
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,100
If he just hadn't made that one comment, I wouldn't care, but he did.

1822
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,440
He didn't respond to it in any way.

1823
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,940
You didn't let him know that you were not going to do it until now.

1824
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:57,640
Yeah, I mean, what am I going to put a fucking paragraph after paragraph about how fucking

1825
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,700
insensitive and cruel that comment was?

1826
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,700
I think that's how you do it.

1827
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,980
Well, you did it, but you did it verbally right now.

1828
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,100
Which is way easier than typing it out, so there you go.

1829
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:12,300
Listen, dental plan, Lisa needs braces, damn, have y'all been mean for six hours just swirling

1830
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,740
around in your head just over and over, you're stewing in and out.

1831
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,740
Pretty much.

1832
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,740
Yeah.

1833
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:17,740
Yeah, pretty much.

1834
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,740
Damn.

1835
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,740
Damn.

1836
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:23,180
Okay, listen, this is going to be the greatest good of all time.

1837
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,340
But we got a lot accomplished.

1838
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:30,460
We got, in spite of Digi's meddling, in spite of him putting up roadblock after roadblock,

1839
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,460
we accomplished everything.

1840
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,900
No, man, that's giving you too much credit.

1841
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,700
It was pure indifference.

1842
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,460
This is the most fucking totem on our heads thing that's ever been fucking like, like

1843
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:44,140
Digi's is like a nefarious mastermind trying to thwart Radcon at every, not like, you

1844
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,740
know, being uninformed, like, active guy.

1845
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,740
He hates us, Monty.

1846
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,740
He hates us, Monty.

1847
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,620
He feeds on the chaos and the discord that he ensues in our hearts.

1848
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:53,620
He feeds upon it.

1849
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:54,620
It's his only means of substance.

1850
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,860
I mean, the premise behind this whole thing is that like, if you're not present for discussions,

1851
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,540
you basically have no say.

1852
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:04,540
So you know, you have no say in what your reputation will be going forward either.

1853
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,540
That's right.

1854
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,540
After day one.

1855
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,980
It's your own fault if we conspire against you.

1856
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:09,980
That's right.

1857
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:10,980
Exactly.

1858
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,100
I want every single person, every single comment after day one of Radcon to be, damn, have

1859
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:17,100
y'all been meeting for 24 hours and then so on and so forth.

1860
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,780
Damn, have y'all been meeting for 10 days?

1861
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,580
Dude, Radcon 4 means to come in early.

1862
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,580
Oh yeah, I guess so.

1863
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,580
That's true.

1864
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:25,580
It's an early slime or not.

1865
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,580
You're present for everyone.

1866
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:30,100
I'm sure you guys know, and people can certainly weaponize this against me, but like, the thing

1867
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,500
that makes me the most angry in this world, I definitely mentioned it to degrees before,

1868
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:40,620
is like, not like an insult that like, hey, your stuff's shit, but like, like a disrespect

1869
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,740
for the effort being put into something as if it's like it was pointless or didn't matter.

1870
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:53,380
Shows like that are the most angering to me because it just, it shows like no care for

1871
01:19:53,380 --> 01:20:00,860
the effort being put into something, you know, it's just the most angering thing someone

1872
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,860
can say.

1873
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:02,860
Mm-hmm.

1874
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,860
For me personally.

1875
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:04,860
Yeah.

1876
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,860
There you go.

1877
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:06,860
Understandable.

1878
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,180
I will say like I was saying at the beginning, the Radcon Fiora bureaucracy has been mind-numbing

1879
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,300
and terrible and like the actual act of like, you know, searching for things.

1880
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:17,340
So it was profitable, I think, and productive, and it's now like done basically.

1881
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,340
We got it.

1882
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,340
It is.

1883
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,340
And you know what, it was fraternizing, which is good and cool.

1884
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,740
I think I can use the word fraternizing in this way.

1885
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,700
Well, that means to collaborate or something, right?

1886
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,700
Yeah.

1887
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,700
I don't know.

1888
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,700
Yeah.

1889
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,700
It was community building, but for like friends.

1890
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,740
I think that's called like a conversation, I don't know, I don't think I've ever heard

1891
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:37,740
of it.

1892
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,660
I feel like we've gone through a trial by fire.

1893
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:40,660
Yeah.

1894
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:50,300
We all suffered through a common misery and we're all closer to the experience.

1895
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,900
Dude, it's just like the West and Nazis, bro.

1896
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,380
It's just like World War II.

1897
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,300
It's just like band of fucking gather, dude.

1898
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,220
It is like the Band of Brothers.

1899
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:02,700
But like it's like we're the veterans who already fought like the first salvo of the

1900
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,260
people and then like the new recruits were like, I can't wait, you guys are having so

1901
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,260
much fun at war here, can't wait to join.

1902
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,620
And we're like this motherfucking piece.

1903
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:15,900
We are, we are like proud war veterans in the Vietnam War, right?

1904
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:20,500
We've been out there doing good work, burning down villages, napalming preschools and stuff.

1905
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,980
And then we get back here and Digi's here with his fucking hippie protest like, uh,

1906
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:29,740
you know, child killer and I'm like, come on, freedom isn't free, fucker.

1907
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:34,500
We are like the admirable Viet Cong going through the jungles, building tunnels underground

1908
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,780
and Digi's just trying to blow up our rainforest and do guerrilla warfare tactics against us

1909
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:39,780
every single step of the fucking way.

1910
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,780
We're out here setting the Amazon rainforest on fire.

1911
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,780
Okay.

1912
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,780
This was kind of weird.

1913
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:45,780
I saw an article.

1914
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,780
Fucking up our atmosphere.

1915
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,580
The great Australia brush fire.

1916
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:52,420
There's like a weird like image, like a CCTV footage of like this like homeless looking

1917
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,820
guy with like a joint like walking away and like he threw down the joint on the ground

1918
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,820
and it started like a big fire.

1919
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:57,820
That's really like strange.

1920
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:00,820
It's really kind of weird actually.

1921
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,140
Also Pam's was playing in the background.

1922
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:08,500
I guess to be fair, the redeeming thing is that at important moments when we needed

1923
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,140
Digi's input, he did eventually respond.

1924
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:15,220
It was much harder to reach them than other people, but you know, fucking bad or epic

1925
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,220
wall fucking epic.

1926
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,220
Yeah.

1927
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,220
Yeah.

1928
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,740
That's why he did join for some jobs where he was needed.

1929
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,220
So it wasn't all bad.

1930
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:24,220
Listen, right.

1931
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,220
Okay.

1932
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,220
Okay.

1933
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,220
Okay.

1934
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,220
All right.

1935
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:29,220
Here's what, here's what you need to understand guys and cut this out.

1936
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,220
Eleazar.

1937
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,860
If this is like too much, if this is too real, listen, we're already in the ship, we've spent

1938
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:39,060
hours of our lives, you know, conducting a research, trying, oh my God, the search for

1939
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:43,220
the house of this fucking place was an actual fucking number that went on long into the

1940
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,220
night.

1941
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,220
That was literally a travesty.

1942
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,300
That was a holocaust too, if ever I fucking seen one.

1943
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,100
And even on top of that, just all the hours to put it into trying to figure out things,

1944
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,740
all the hours I spent making the logo for this, this has been a long endeavor and we

1945
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,300
already have the Airbnb.

1946
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,540
We already bought for it.

1947
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,100
We bought all of our plane tickets.

1948
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,100
We're fucking in the ship.

1949
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,100
Cut that out.

1950
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,100
Don't let them know.

1951
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,100
Don't let them know.

1952
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,540
Cut out the entire point then.

1953
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,980
I don't want them to know we have financial vulnerability.

1954
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,980
Isn't that good though?

1955
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,980
Isn't that good?

1956
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:16,060
No, we should tell them, yeah, we've already invested in it, like we've already put the

1957
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:22,100
money where our mouth is and now it's up to them to make sure we don't regret it.

1958
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,820
That's the idea, but I was going to be like, now you fucking better donate, bro, at the

1959
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:26,820
wall.

1960
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,220
No, don't argue for a position of weakness.

1961
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,220
That's gay.

1962
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,220
Is that weakness?

1963
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,620
I'm just saying that I think it's good.

1964
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:37,300
I think it shows that we are dedicated, that we went right ahead with it.

1965
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,300
We got the house.

1966
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,220
We already bought all our plane tickets and stuff.

1967
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,220
We did.

1968
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,220
That is true.

1969
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,340
I think it makes us seem like chads where it's like, listen, we don't even fucking care,

1970
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,340
bro.

1971
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,340
We're out here.

1972
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,460
If you want to be out here, then you can be, but if you're too fucking pussy and gay,

1973
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,940
then you won't, but we're fucking out here, dog.

1974
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,940
We're here.

1975
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,660
We're at the level.

1976
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,660
We went right at it.

1977
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:02,980
We paid for it all out of our own pocket and now it's just the Kickstarter now is what's

1978
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:07,220
going to make us not have lost all our money.

1979
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,220
Yeah.

1980
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,220
Fair enough.

1981
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,220
Fair enough.

1982
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,220
Keep it in L.A.S.R.

1983
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,220
Flip a coin.

1984
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,220
What were you saying, Munchie?

1985
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,220
You were making a point there of some kind.

1986
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,700
No, the point was that.

1987
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,700
So.

1988
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:17,700
Oh, okay.

1989
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,700
Okay.

1990
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,700
I see.

1991
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,140
Well, audience, if you've heard this, then you've experienced a very special.

1992
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:26,780
The reason we did that was because plane tickets get more expensive.

1993
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:34,380
We would have paid double for the plane tickets probably if we'd waited until the Kickstarter

1994
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,420
succeeded to buy our tickets.

1995
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,420
So.

1996
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,420
Yep.

1997
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,420
That's true.

1998
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,620
We're doing our best over here.

1999
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,620
Hmm.

2000
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,260
Well, I guess it'll be what it may be.

2001
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,620
The Kickstarter will be ready today.

2002
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,620
Who knows?

2003
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,620
I don't know.

2004
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,620
I don't know.

2005
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:49,620
Probably not.

2006
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,620
But in the next few days, it should be out.

2007
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,620
Maybe.

2008
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,620
I mean.

2009
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:53,620
Well, I don't know how much is left to go.

2010
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:54,620
Gotta make a video.

2011
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:55,620
Gotta blah, blah, blah.

2012
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,620
Oh, yeah.

2013
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,620
Somebody's got to make an announcement video.

2014
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,180
That's probably like the biggest thing.

2015
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,180
Yeah.

2016
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,180
That is the biggest thing.

2017
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,180
And then maybe a couple little details.

2018
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,620
But I guess we'll see.

2019
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,620
So look for that.

2020
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,140
But I guess that's it.

2021
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,300
That's all I wanted to say about that.

2022
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,580
More details will be on the Kickstarter when it comes out.

2023
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,980
So keep your eyes peeled.

2024
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,340
I guess that's it.

2025
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,820
Tretch Gold, we get on the flight logs.

2026
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:22,100
We ascend reality and we get to be on the mythical flight logs.

2027
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,700
We need to be etched into history in the most admirable way possible.

2028
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,620
By being on planes and being on the...

2029
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:30,620
No, no, no.

2030
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,300
Not just any flight logs, the flight logs name.

2031
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,300
What are the flight logs?

2032
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,300
I don't know what you mean.

2033
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,100
The Jeffrey Epstein jet flight logs, of course.

2034
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,100
What else could I need?

2035
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,100
The Lilite Express flight logs.

2036
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,100
Yeah.

2037
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,100
I think.

2038
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,100
Okay.

2039
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,100
Okay.

2040
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,100
Now I get it.

2041
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,100
We go instead to Epstein Islands to have our confines.

2042
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,100
Yeah.

2043
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,100
What are you doing?

2044
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,100
That would be epic.

2045
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,100
Redcon 5 Epstein Islands.

2046
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,100
Yes.

2047
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,100
We have to.

2048
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,100
We have to kill ourselves.

2049
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,100
It's just like a hero.

2050
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,100
It's like a hero Epstein.

2051
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:01,100
I can't wait to kill myself.

2052
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:06,100
Has anybody got a bed sheet handy?

2053
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Anybody got some gravity handy?

2054
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,100
I don't actually know that.

2055
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,100
We're done.

2056
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,100
Let's do voicemails.

2057
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,100
Let's go to voicemails now.

2058
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,100
Okay.

2059
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,100
That sounds good.

2060
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,100
How many do we...

2061
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,100
Oh wait.

2062
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,100
Oh wait.

2063
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,100
So okay.

2064
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,100
Fucking issue with rhythm.

2065
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:24,100
We all got to play them ourselves, but we can do it.

2066
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,100
Leave them.

2067
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,100
Leave your voicemails at the speak pipe link down below.

2068
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,100
It's still working.

2069
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,100
I didn't change anything.

2070
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,100
Still going just fine.

2071
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,100
I forgot about the worst part of this fucking show.

2072
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,100
Okay.

2073
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,100
All right.

2074
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,100
Let's go.

2075
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,100
Let's go.

2076
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,100
We have eight of them.

2077
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,100
Do you guys have them up?

2078
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,100
You have them up?

2079
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,100
Shit.

2080
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,100
Let me...

2081
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,100
I got to set it so it's coming out of my headphones.

2082
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,100
God.

2083
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:44,100
Oh my fucking god.

2084
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,100
Hardware and sound.

2085
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,100
Jesus.

2086
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:51,100
Can we talk about the real worst member of the PCP?

2087
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,100
Ben Saints?

2088
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,100
Yeah.

2089
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,600
I mean I have the exact same problem and I've tried to fix it for weeks.

2090
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,000
It doesn't fix.

2091
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,420
So it will just come out of my speakers and get picked up by my mic.

2092
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,540
So I'll just mute myself while I listen, I guess.

2093
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,540
Okay.

2094
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,540
That works.

2095
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,540
I have fixed the issue.

2096
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,540
I am ready to go.

2097
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:08,540
Okay.

2098
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,540
We got...

2099
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,540
First one is live from the Cuck Shed.

2100
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:11,540
Sounds like a winner.

2101
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,540
Okay.

2102
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,540
So on the count of three, everybody play it.

2103
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,540
Okay.

2104
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,540
Here we go.

2105
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,980
Three.

2106
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,100
So, did anyone in the PCP see little women?

2107
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,860
It's okay because you're all men and that you're afraid to watch it.

2108
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,860
You got this.

2109
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,780
I believe in your fam.

2110
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,780
Support women now.

2111
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:28,780
Before it's too late.

2112
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,780
Wait, did we see little women?

2113
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,780
Have you seen little women?

2114
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,780
Have you seen little women?

2115
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,780
No.

2116
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,780
Every day I see them.

2117
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,780
They are diminutive.

2118
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,780
They're pretty small.

2119
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,780
I mean, relatively.

2120
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:37,780
I'd like to see more of them, frankly.

2121
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:40,780
I'd say looking at my anime figurine collection now.

2122
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,780
I can joke about really fast.

2123
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,780
Wait, before the show, Ben was going to say something really cool.

2124
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,780
Is there something like you met a girl?

2125
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:46,780
You met a girl today, Ben?

2126
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,780
Yeah.

2127
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:48,780
Tell that story, please.

2128
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,780
That's right.

2129
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:50,780
This is good.

2130
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,780
This is funny.

2131
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,780
Well, okay.

2132
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:53,780
The meme is that...

2133
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,780
It was a miniature woman.

2134
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:55,780
Yeah.

2135
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,780
This was the meme on the last quick draw we recorded.

2136
01:27:56,780 --> 01:28:01,780
Before we started, I said in the call, hey, guys, I talked to you.

2137
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:08,780
And everyone fucking crucified him and brutalized him.

2138
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,780
And laid his corpse on the floor.

2139
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,780
Oh, my God.

2140
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:13,780
She had huge tits.

2141
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,780
Her tits were so fucking big, by the way.

2142
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,780
Wow.

2143
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:16,780
Should I tell?

2144
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:17,780
Should I tell what happened?

2145
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,780
The legendary story?

2146
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,780
You're already sitting on the quick draw.

2147
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:20,780
It'll be on the quick draw, won't it?

2148
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,780
No, I want to fucking hear it, goddamn it.

2149
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,780
I haven't heard it.

2150
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:23,780
I don't think you actually...

2151
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,780
I don't think you actually told the story.

2152
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,780
You started to tell it, and then we made fun of you.

2153
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,780
I don't think I did.

2154
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,780
Okay.

2155
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,780
All right.

2156
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,780
It sucks.

2157
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,780
It's a bad story.

2158
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:31,780
Good, good.

2159
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,780
So strap in.

2160
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,780
Well, I was at Garment District, you know, shopping for women's clothes, like I do.

2161
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:36,780
And I don't know.

2162
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:41,780
There was just a girl walking around, and she was really cute, and she had the biggest

2163
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,780
tits imaginable.

2164
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,780
Incredible.

2165
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:44,780
Incredible.

2166
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:45,780
Incredible.

2167
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,780
Incredible.

2168
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,780
Incredible.

2169
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:48,780
Incredible.

2170
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,780
Incredible.

2171
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,780
Incredible.

2172
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,780
Incredible.

2173
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,780
Incredible.

2174
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,780
Incredible.

2175
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,780
Incredible.

2176
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,780
Incredible.

2177
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,780
Incredible.

2178
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,780
Incredible.

2179
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,780
Incredible.

2180
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,780
Incredible.

2181
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,780
Incredible.

2182
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,780
Incredible.

2183
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,780
Incredible.

2184
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,780
Incredible.

2185
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,780
Incredible.

2186
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,780
Incredible.

2187
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,780
Incredible.

2188
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:07,780
Incredible.

2189
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,780
Incredible.

2190
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,780
Incredible.

2191
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,780
Incredible.

2192
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,780
Incredible.

2193
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,780
Incredible.

2194
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,780
Incredible.

2195
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:14,780
Incredible.

2196
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:15,780
Incredible.

2197
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,780
Incredible.

2198
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,780
Incredible.

2199
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,780
Incredible.

2200
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,780
Incredible.

2201
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:21,740
I was just like, wow, you're gorgeous.

2202
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,100
And she was like, is that bad?

2203
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,660
No, it's fine.

2204
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,740
Ignore the Zoomers.

2205
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,820
They don't know how to talk to people.

2206
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,580
Yeah, I just said, you're gorgeous.

2207
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,500
And she was like, thanks.

2208
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,540
I really appreciate it.

2209
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:35,220
And I was like, OK, she doesn't want to be

2210
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,540
spoken to by the male in public.

2211
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,740
And that's her prerogative.

2212
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,100
So I was just like, OK, cool.

2213
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:42,980
That was it.

2214
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,580
That's the whole story.

2215
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,620
It's almost like the fucking worst method

2216
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,100
in the entire world you could have done to get inside her pants

2217
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,300
Give me a better method, Zoomer.

2218
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,460
You have to work up to that.

2219
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,820
You can't fucking just say, hey, you are a fuck right now.

2220
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,740
You can't just say that.

2221
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:56,240
OK.

2222
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,660
People don't want to talk to you right now.

2223
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:01,340
It was perhaps a slightly coming on a little strong.

2224
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,180
But I mean, look, whatever.

2225
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:02,660
It doesn't matter.

2226
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,700
At least you talked to someone.

2227
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:04,300
Give us time.

2228
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,140
Munchie's talked to another human being ever.

2229
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,100
Propose me an alternative strategy

2230
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,260
that you would not be making fun of then.

2231
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,420
Listen, I'm going to ask her about whatever specific thing

2232
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,060
you say.

2233
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,060
People will mock.

2234
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,500
Whatever the specific thing is.

2235
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,300
Like, that's not good enough because people

2236
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,260
are so precious about their interaction with girls.

2237
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,580
Hey, hey, oh, hi.

2238
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,220
Oh, what you buying for?

2239
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:24,220
You out shopping?

2240
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,220
Nice weather we're having.

2241
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,900
Then you didn't execute your one, two, three incremental nags.

2242
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,500
You know, you didn't establish rapport first.

2243
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,500
We could always.

2244
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,660
Ben, you want to play this game?

2245
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:35,500
OK, we can all just use silly voices to, hey,

2246
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,780
you're looking beautiful today, babe.

2247
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:42,300
That's probably more accurate to how it actually went.

2248
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,700
To an outside observer.

2249
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,980
Listen, I'm not being Ben Shapiro's sister, by the way.

2250
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:49,220
I'm just imagining that the person that you're talking to.

2251
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,020
Well, now you know the story.

2252
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:55,580
And you can all go fuck yourselves.

2253
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,860
You know what, what have you done today?

2254
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,460
Nothing.

2255
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:01,740
I, too, have talked to girls and embarrassed myself

2256
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,580
in doing so many.

2257
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,740
This wasn't even that embarrassing.

2258
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:05,740
But I have done far worse.

2259
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:09,420
And to anyone, have you ever told a girl

2260
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:09,980
she was gorgeous?

2261
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,900
In your fucking life, you cowards.

2262
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,660
I just know there's people out there laughing

2263
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,940
and I want them dead.

2264
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,860
But OK, that's enough.

2265
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,260
That's enough on that.

2266
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:18,980
Like, I'm sorry.

2267
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:19,540
I'm sorry.

2268
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,860
If I say, never mind.

2269
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,820
I don't have to justify myself.

2270
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,740
It's fine to say it.

2271
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:28,140
It's just like in a clothing store, it's a bit weird.

2272
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:31,260
Like, it's just blanket a bit weird to start with.

2273
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:31,740
Oh my god.

2274
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,380
Anyone thinks it's weird that you're Ben?

2275
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,580
I'm saying is you blew it.

2276
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:35,940
You could have had it and you blew it.

2277
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,820
That's the only concern.

2278
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:38,460
OK, but you're right, Munchie.

2279
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:39,740
I fucked up.

2280
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,100
He took a shot, man.

2281
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,580
I made a critical error.

2282
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,100
You cringed, posted in real life,

2283
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,740
wait you fucking hard and you blew it.

2284
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,540
I mean, it's not like I expected it.

2285
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,420
It's not like I was like, oh, if I say this,

2286
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:53,340
she will fucking, she'll be all into it.

2287
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,460
She'll be all over me if I say she's gorgeous.

2288
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,340
It all comes down to episode three of Fooley Cooley.

2289
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,540
I think that's episode three or episode four

2290
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,900
about swinging the bat.

2291
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,460
So many people just don't swing the bat at all.

2292
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,780
That's episode four because I stopped in episode three

2293
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:07,100
and I haven't been there yet.

2294
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,220
OK, then maybe it's episode four.

2295
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,820
But it's so much more honorable and respectable

2296
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,860
to swing the bat even if you fail.

2297
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:16,020
Thank you, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

2298
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:16,460
There you go.

2299
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,060
Exactly.

2300
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:17,420
OK, all right.

2301
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:17,980
And you know what?

2302
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,620
And you know what?

2303
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,900
OK, I'm going to justify myself even more.

2304
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:21,500
You know what?

2305
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,660
I could tell by her response that she

2306
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,420
wasn't super comfortable with it.

2307
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:29,900
And so I was like, OK, well, I'll leave you alone.

2308
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,140
And I didn't say anything else to her.

2309
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:31,740
Yes, that's well done.

2310
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,020
And I think I did everything right.

2311
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,100
So there you go.

2312
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,020
There you go.

2313
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,660
There you go.

2314
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,060
You're gay.

2315
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:38,660
I'm sickly.

2316
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:39,860
Take a lesson.

2317
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,620
Hey, hey, babe, do you dip french fries

2318
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:43,780
and it melt chicks?

2319
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,700
Do I have an ice cream flavor for you?

2320
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,940
Next time you're a listener, next time

2321
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,340
you're going to call into the PCP with some dumb question

2322
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,140
and be like, oh, I saw this girl.

2323
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:56,260
And I don't know how to tell her I like her.

2324
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:57,620
Like, how do I ask a girl out?

2325
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,860
Just like, just remember, just use the Ben St method.

2326
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,180
And get rejected immediately.

2327
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,940
And get the Ben St results.

2328
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,340
That's right.

2329
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:08,580
If you play the Ben St game, you get the Ben St earnings.

2330
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,820
That's what you do.

2331
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,140
But you know what I got, though?

2332
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,300
You know what I got out of it?

2333
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:12,780
What?

2334
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,460
A story?

2335
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,540
The moral victory.

2336
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,100
Of course, of course.

2337
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,620
All right, let's go to that deal still on top.

2338
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:25,420
Don't pretend to like jazz unless you know who Ben St is.

2339
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:29,020
All right, voicemail number two, it's from gayboyjo.

2340
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,940
All right, you guys all good?

2341
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:31,740
I am like, yes.

2342
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,260
Good?

2343
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,340
This is my boo.

2344
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,620
On the count of three, click on it.

2345
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,220
Here we go.

2346
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,180
One, two, three.

2347
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,340
I wish our man got a face of the facts.

2348
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,980
I'm 25 and my voice still cracks.

2349
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,660
I'm a little bitch ain't worth the shit my dick.

2350
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:47,380
But I got my butt fucked a dude, even though he had AIDS

2351
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:50,060
and a bad attitude, because even though I ain't gay,

2352
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,100
there ain't no way I'd get in there late.

2353
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,500
Even if I had the pegs, ugly as sin,

2354
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,900
can even begin to pop the pimples in my face

2355
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,700
like the night sky, constellations all over the place.

2356
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,380
And I'm sick and tired of running in front of this damn rat race.

2357
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,140
I can't keep pace.

2358
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:07,060
That's all I got.

2359
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,500
Poetry, poetry.

2360
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,100
Pointless.

2361
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,700
Thanks, thanks, Joe.

2362
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:11,860
I like how he stumbled.

2363
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:12,620
That was funny.

2364
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,900
It was pointless.

2365
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,020
We asked for poetry.

2366
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,660
Self-deprecating humor is perennial.

2367
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,020
We'll never go out of fashion.

2368
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,620
Indeed.

2369
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,340
Indeed.

2370
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,060
By the way, somebody else.

2371
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,940
It would have been funnier if he was badly

2372
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:26,420
rapping about how good he can rap.

2373
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,900
I suppose that's true.

2374
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,020
That is correct.

2375
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:29,660
Yeah.

2376
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,340
By the way, there was another guy who left on that.

2377
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,620
I think it was like PC poetry.

2378
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,740
OK, that guy left one interesting poem

2379
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:37,740
about the Wright brothers.

2380
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,060
But it was over two voicemails.

2381
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,660
And look, I got to tell you, if you

2382
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,180
are expecting me to commit to playing two voicemails

2383
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,900
for your voicemail, it's got to be something above and beyond.

2384
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,220
And it was not up to quite that caliber, dude.

2385
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,020
Pair it down.

2386
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:52,780
Pair it down.

2387
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:55,420
Just pair it down to one and submit it again.

2388
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,020
Editorialize, remove some of that shit, send it again.

2389
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:58,820
It was good.

2390
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,820
But it was just too fucking long.

2391
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,220
All right, let's go to the next one.

2392
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:02,900
Here we go.

2393
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,660
Tectonic improv, you guys good?

2394
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,500
You ready to click?

2395
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,780
Yes, this guy, who may I remind you,

2396
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:12,980
this is the guy who did a PCPU style lecture on the canon

2397
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:15,700
of Linkara and the Linkara universe.

2398
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,540
Oh, right.

2399
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:16,900
Fascinating.

2400
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:20,100
If you want to check it out, he's got a YouTube channel.

2401
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,500
It's called Tectonic Improv.

2402
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,620
It's entertaining.

2403
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,100
Well, shit.

2404
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:23,460
All right.

2405
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,500
He also does other stuff.

2406
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,980
But let's see what he has to say today.

2407
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,380
All right, start on the count of three.

2408
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,060
Here we go.

2409
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,620
One, two, three.

2410
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,700
So Ben brought up that Matthew Matosis released

2411
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,420
a new video in the last podcast.

2412
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,500
Yeah, he got cut off.

2413
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,060
I don't know if anyone had anything to say about that.

2414
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:43,020
But I'd like to hear you guys' thoughts on it.

2415
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:45,580
Personally, I was really psyched to watch the video.

2416
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,540
And I got like 20 minutes in.

2417
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,940
And then I realized that I kind of want

2418
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,540
to play the game for myself.

2419
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:55,660
And I feel like the commentary will be a lot more

2420
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,100
enjoyable that way.

2421
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,580
You guys ever really had that sort of thought

2422
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:04,620
where you wanted to watch a video on a game or an anime

2423
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,820
or something?

2424
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,700
And maybe you got like a little while in.

2425
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,820
And then we're like, you know what?

2426
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:15,860
I want to watch the show before I get any further into this.

2427
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,780
This is the saddest reflection of modern society

2428
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:21,380
that I've literally ever seen in my entire fucking life.

2429
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,460
The fact that this is a quaint idea.

2430
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:27,340
Like, ooh, maybe I should like actually like watch the show

2431
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,300
instead of just watching the video essay,

2432
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,660
reviewing the show by my favorite internet personality.

2433
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:35,700
Ooh, oh, that's such a weird, like a new kooky idea.

2434
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,100
Oh, very strange.

2435
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,900
I'm going to defend this other bizarrely idea.

2436
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:45,540
I kind of don't care about spoilers, like almost ever.

2437
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:48,860
I can't remember the last time I was like,

2438
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,620
oh, a guy put out a video essay about a thing,

2439
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,180
but I haven't seen the thing.

2440
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,860
Oh, the biggest example.

2441
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:57,100
I better go check it out before I watch the video.

2442
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,860
I watched all of Twin Peaks before ever experiencing

2443
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,980
any of the stuff they talked about.

2444
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:01,980
And I absolutely love them.

2445
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:05,580
But at this position, I had gone and watched all of Twin Peaks.

2446
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,180
And like all of Silent Hill, blah, blah, blah.

2447
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,700
And they just came out with their giant season three

2448
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:11,900
of Twin Peaks like review or whatever.

2449
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,220
And for this one, I was like, okay.

2450
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,060
That's a while ago.

2451
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,260
Yeah, at this point, it was months,

2452
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,020
but I still haven't, I just have been doing other stuff.

2453
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,340
I watched most, some of it, not all of it.

2454
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,660
You haven't seen it yet.

2455
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,300
I'm halfway through, give or take.

2456
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,220
So like, no.

2457
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:23,900
Wait, the review or through the show?

2458
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,740
Through the show.

2459
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:27,420
I put the review on hold to watch the show first.

2460
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,220
Even though that's different from how I consumed

2461
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,620
all the other material, but since I was so close

2462
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,460
and I just had to watch one thing.

2463
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,340
But like, you'd seen the old Twin Peaks.

2464
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:37,340
So you were like largely, you were in it already.

2465
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,420
Exactly, which is why I felt comfortable doing this.

2466
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:43,860
But I just put it off cause like, you know,

2467
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:46,220
I wanna fucking experience it for, they say,

2468
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:49,020
like it's the spoiler warning of a lifetime right now.

2469
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:50,380
At the very beginning, I'm like, well, okay.

2470
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,300
I guess I'll, you know, I'd seen the old,

2471
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,140
I'd seen the old Twin Peaks.

2472
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,420
I wasn't that interested in watching the new one.

2473
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,940
So even though I thought about it,

2474
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,740
I decided to just go ahead and watch the video anyway.

2475
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,420
And I don't regret it personally.

2476
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:03,260
Well, that's fine.

2477
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,060
Even if I did later on decide to watch the new Twin Peaks,

2478
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,100
I don't think it would like hugely denigrate

2479
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,220
my enjoyment of it.

2480
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,380
You're probably right.

2481
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,900
It might even improve it, I don't know.

2482
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,220
It's not about spoilers or not.

2483
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,220
Don't you see what's happening here?

2484
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,460
You're all lying to yourselves.

2485
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:19,980
Cause so, so, so often it's not like,

2486
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:22,180
oh, you know, I'm in taking this information

2487
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,900
and I will watch the show eventually,

2488
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,180
but I'm just getting spoiled for it now.

2489
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:26,020
I don't care about that.

2490
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,220
That was a completely separate issue.

2491
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:30,940
So, so often, 99% of the fucking time,

2492
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,380
it's not you are just watching the video essay

2493
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,740
or, you know, the review of it

2494
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:37,380
and you never get around to the actual thing.

2495
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,460
Cause you've just in taken all the information from it.

2496
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,900
And you know, that's completely different

2497
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:41,940
from actually watching the show,

2498
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,660
but you've satisfied your bloodlust

2499
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,300
and, you know, a hunger for content.

2500
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,060
So that you're not actually going to get around to it.

2501
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,940
This is the exact opposite of what should be happening.

2502
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,420
You should be actually watching shows

2503
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,740
instead of just watching regurgitation.

2504
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,260
That's exactly what I described.

2505
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,100
I don't know how many shows I actually want to watch though.

2506
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,140
Well, that's a problem.

2507
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,180
There's only like two shows per year

2508
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,860
that are worth anything.

2509
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:03,700
There's good old ones.

2510
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:06,460
Currently, yeah, there's tons of old ones.

2511
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,260
Like, you could, I could easily do someone

2512
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:09,500
making like a great review.

2513
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,340
Maybe I'll do this one day.

2514
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,180
I mean, like to watch.

2515
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,060
I watch two things per year.

2516
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:13,900
Okay, sure.

2517
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:14,740
Yeah, and that's a problem.

2518
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,140
And I'm maybe one day I'll do a big video

2519
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,660
on like The Sopranos, a show I love

2520
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:19,620
and watch the entire thing.

2521
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,860
It's like seven seasons, but it does rule.

2522
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:23,580
But like anyone who I'm like,

2523
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,700
hey, go watch it first.

2524
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:26,460
We're talking like seven seasons or whatever

2525
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,300
of a fucking show.

2526
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,900
So that's a big commitment.

2527
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,500
I have a lot of like,

2528
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,020
oh, it would be nice if I could get around

2529
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:35,980
to watching Star Trek The Next Generation or something.

2530
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:36,980
Yeah, yeah.

2531
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:41,180
I have lots of like a list, like mind maps of those things.

2532
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:46,020
But like, I feel like in the free time I have

2533
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:50,020
getting that all set up annoys me.

2534
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:55,020
And even if it's easy, I don't like binge watching things.

2535
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:57,300
And so, I don't know.

2536
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,620
You don't have to binge watch Star Trek.

2537
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,980
It's a different mindset to sit down

2538
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:03,620
and watch some episode of a thing

2539
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:09,060
than it is to like passively intake a YouTube video

2540
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,620
while you're doing something else.

2541
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,300
Yeah, and it's a massively worse experience.

2542
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,140
You can get way less out of it.

2543
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:13,980
You can passively consume.

2544
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:16,820
I will strongly advocate Star Trek is a show.

2545
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:19,040
Most of it I watched, tabbed out,

2546
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,780
just listening to people talk, doing other work.

2547
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,500
It's absolutely a show you can do that.

2548
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,860
But I'm just making my little pitch

2549
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:26,500
because I love Star Trek and I want everyone to watch it.

2550
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,740
Neither here nor there.

2551
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:30,700
In any case, the point is fair.

2552
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:34,060
I would like to be in the mindset

2553
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:37,500
where I want to consume thing.

2554
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,860
But like, I very rarely get excited for anything.

2555
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:42,140
It's just, it's not even like YouTube.

2556
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,180
This has been like all of my life.

2557
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:47,260
Like, I just don't care about stuff.

2558
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,540
I have a very, very small pool of things

2559
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:52,340
I'm extremely passionate about.

2560
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:53,700
You're on the same page as me.

2561
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,940
I'm just, I just don't care.

2562
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,580
I just don't care that much about, oh, a show is out?

2563
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,340
How good could it possibly be?

2564
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,500
Well, look at the classics though.

2565
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:05,900
I mean, I would find, I'm certainly in what's become a classic.

2566
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,220
I mean, it's not even like,

2567
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:09,220
it's not even about like, oh, current things.

2568
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,820
It's all, it's all media.

2569
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:14,140
Like I intake not that much media

2570
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:16,580
and I'm pretty happy with the amount of, you know,

2571
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:19,380
that I don't watch, like cause.

2572
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:20,220
Fair enough.

2573
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:21,060
I don't know.

2574
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,540
Like it sort of gets overwhelming

2575
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,340
if I'm trying to watch one show,

2576
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,500
like one episode per week.

2577
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:29,700
Even if it's an old one.

2578
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,340
It's just sort of like, ah, who cares?

2579
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,020
I think without strong influences in your art

2580
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:38,620
and being an artist and not seeking out other artists' work,

2581
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,740
I think is a major detriment to your evolution

2582
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:44,180
as a person, as a human being and as an artist.

2583
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,020
I think it's a big problem.

2584
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,060
You're probably right.

2585
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:49,380
But just like such a small percentage of the things

2586
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:53,620
that I do consume end up being like meaningful to me.

2587
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,460
Sure, but that's what you gotta do.

2588
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:55,300
It's discouraging.

2589
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,140
It's discouraging.

2590
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:58,420
There's a sense, all right, there's that, all right.

2591
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:01,180
But there's also like life experiences.

2592
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,780
I'm not saying like YouTube is life experiences.

2593
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:06,380
YouTube is definitely bad and I agree with you on that.

2594
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:12,180
But like when it comes to meaningful experiences,

2595
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:14,820
I know what I like and I seem to like the same things

2596
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:18,580
every time and so like going for a walk is like something,

2597
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:21,660
you know, I mean, I went for a walk today.

2598
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:25,340
I walked the dog and it was cold, but the sun came out

2599
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:29,700
and you know, the sun was like glistening on the lake

2600
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,580
and across the grass and it was like incredible.

2601
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,500
Like I would much rather had gone on that walk

2602
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,740
than watch a few episodes of a show

2603
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:39,720
I've been meaning to get around to.

2604
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,060
Okay, fair enough.

2605
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:42,980
Hey, what can you say?

2606
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:45,100
I get you, I mean, I understand that.

2607
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,740
But I think that, okay, I think that novelties of virtue,

2608
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:49,060
I think originalities of virtue,

2609
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,780
I think that experiencing new things

2610
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:52,460
is almost inherently good.

2611
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,620
And I think that people overestimate

2612
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:57,780
how hard it is to get into things

2613
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,980
even that are super long,

2614
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:01,740
like let's say for Homestuck for example, for instance,

2615
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,060
and this isn't a great example

2616
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,580
because this is extremely short show,

2617
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:05,900
but as we were just talking about it,

2618
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:10,500
Fooly Coolie has been on my radar forever, forever.

2619
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,780
And I've always wanted to watch it,

2620
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,020
but I just haven't gone around to it

2621
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,700
because I fucking hate watching things.

2622
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,740
I'm on the same page of the sense that it's like,

2623
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:19,620
I tried to watch like a couple of like episodic dramas

2624
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:21,740
or like HBO dramas and it was so fucking hard

2625
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:23,100
to slog through them all.

2626
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,340
But once I get into a show and I just say, okay,

2627
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,780
today I'm gonna watch like an episode, you know,

2628
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,980
if I get the time.

2629
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,380
I've just been putting on Fooly Coolie during lunch breaks

2630
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,260
where I normally would put YouTube on

2631
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,620
because I've blocked YouTube from my computer

2632
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,940
literally indefinitely forever.

2633
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:41,980
By the way, link in description to my Tumblr post 2020

2634
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,820
where you can read all about why I'm doing what I'm doing.

2635
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:45,660
But anyway, I've been watching Fooly Coolie

2636
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,540
and it's not that hard.

2637
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:47,820
Obviously it's only six episodes,

2638
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:50,660
but like I can easily see doing this for a longer show.

2639
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,660
It will take some time to realize,

2640
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:56,260
but it'll be so much better for me in the long run

2641
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,580
and feel so much better even in the moment

2642
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,900
than doing the same sort of stuff

2643
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:00,940
that I've done a thousand times before

2644
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:02,260
and re-watching a Dude's Bro video

2645
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,940
and doing all this shit that I could.

2646
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,740
Well, that's your mistake.

2647
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,020
Did you finish Fooly Coolie?

2648
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:10,500
No, but I'm close.

2649
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,460
Oh, it's so good.

2650
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:17,140
When I first like started trying to watch anime in 2014,

2651
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,220
I watched like Space Standing, Kill a Kill

2652
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,620
because they were out and they were cool

2653
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:24,820
and Ava and Gurren Lagann and Cowboy Bebop.

2654
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:27,620
But then, and Fooly Coolie, I think,

2655
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,820
but then there was like Gun Buster and Die Buster,

2656
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:34,580
which was recommended to me by you two, Ben and Nate.

2657
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,940
Yeah, yeah.

2658
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:38,260
And I don't know what it was.

2659
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:40,340
I think it was just sort of the wrong mindset.

2660
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,060
This thing I'm talking about,

2661
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:45,300
like the wrong mindset to enjoy or view something

2662
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:48,860
because I've watched it to get it off the checklist

2663
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:53,860
and I was like, yeah, yeah, well, yeah, cool, yeah, cool.

2664
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,020
Sure.

2665
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:58,300
And I was, my reaction was not,

2666
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:01,980
like my reaction was not cool enough in the chat,

2667
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,100
I remember, and you were like,

2668
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,940
what the fuck, isn't it the coolest thing ever?

2669
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:07,100
And I was like, I stand by.

2670
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:07,940
Sure, sure.

2671
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:10,980
Oh God, this just proves even more

2672
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:13,100
that society is fucking crumbling before me,

2673
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,140
that the West is falling.

2674
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:14,980
This literally proves it.

2675
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:16,740
We truly live in a fallen state.

2676
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:20,340
It's literally, I understand why you have that.

2677
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,620
It's not like you're a fault hippo.

2678
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,300
That's just what these institutions in our life

2679
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,940
has bred us to believe.

2680
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,620
Because you wanna check out these,

2681
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,580
check off these checks on the list

2682
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,260
because you wanna be a part of the conversation

2683
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:32,100
that people are having around us.

2684
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:33,900
We wanna be a part of the YouTube sphere.

2685
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,900
We wanna be able to consume all this stuff about it.

2686
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,980
We wanna get into the fandom and show that.

2687
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:39,060
But yeah, I mean, that's my whole argument

2688
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:41,260
is that if I'm not in the right mindset

2689
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,140
to take something in,

2690
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,600
it's going to be at the expense of the thing.

2691
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,520
And I kind of don't wanna do that.

2692
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,920
Oh, watch a show when I feel like watching it.

2693
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,720
And then it'll be way better.

2694
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,200
I think we all understand this point now.

2695
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,120
Let's go to the next goddamn voicemail.

2696
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:00,640
Okay, I'm ready.

2697
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:03,360
Okay, next one is The Puppet Master.

2698
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,200
We all ready?

2699
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,040
You guys good?

2700
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:05,880
Yeah, yeah.

2701
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,720
Okay, count of three.

2702
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,560
Here we go.

2703
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,720
One, two, three.

2704
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,640
Does being autistic help you focus on your project, dude?

2705
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,800
Does that help?

2706
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,640
Shout out.

2707
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:18,040
Oh, Nate, you wound me deeply.

2708
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,280
Before I respond to that,

2709
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,880
I just need to reiterate the most important part

2710
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,320
of my last voicemail,

2711
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:26,200
which was cut off by your autistic screaming.

2712
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,600
And that is to profess my undying love and affection

2713
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,520
for Hippo and everything that he does.

2714
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,200
Although I did once leave a nasty comment

2715
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,800
on one of his previous videos.

2716
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,800
And I think you know which one it is.

2717
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:42,000
Anyway, yeah, I know Digi is a complete and utter madman

2718
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,880
and his whole autism spectrum thing is just a meme.

2719
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,160
I threw it in there because I thought it might be funny.

2720
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,000
And you know-

2721
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,760
Tell us more of your life story, buddy.

2722
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,600
I'm really serious.

2723
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,440
Oh my god.

2724
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,400
So I understand how you thought that I wasn't joking.

2725
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,240
Oh my god.

2726
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,080
Come on, give me some credit for that.

2727
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,200
I'm not that fucking autistic.

2728
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,080
That aside, I'm really glad you guys

2729
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,920
liked the communist hell voicemails

2730
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,960
and have to put me in the PCP voicemail.

2731
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,640
And I would really like to do a finale

2732
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,880
at some point this year.

2733
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,080
If I can find the inspiration to conclude it.

2734
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,600
It's a nice creative outlet to do fun stuff like this.

2735
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,840
And thanks for the advice.

2736
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,520
I'll try it out and see how it goes.

2737
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,160
And also, Nate, I was not joking in the voicemail

2738
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,960
from Comrade Stalin, October of last year.

2739
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,280
From one software developer to another,

2740
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,320
coding and coder are normie words.

2741
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,760
To thick dick master race digital gods,

2742
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,640
like us, it's called programming.

2743
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:34,120
Anyways, thanks again, guys.

2744
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,840
Xin yen kuala.

2745
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,320
Voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice.

2746
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,280
I mean, what a record.

2747
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,880
This man has been previously in voice grail

2748
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,200
until this point.

2749
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,240
Jail, jail him, jail him.

2750
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,160
Okay, before we make that decision.

2751
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,360
There's something, okay, there's something going on here.

2752
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:59,640
There is a brand of voicemail lever

2753
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,280
who weirdly thinks that we need to know

2754
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,840
so much of their personal backstory

2755
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:09,520
with the voicemail, like guys, I left this voicemail,

2756
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,760
this voicemail, this voicemail,

2757
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:11,600
but you need to know that.

2758
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,440
It's important.

2759
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:15,240
Clearly shows that he is actually that autistic

2760
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,240
with the amount of, like, he assumes so much

2761
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,680
that we would remember all of these things that he's done.

2762
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:22,880
I mean, I do remember them.

2763
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,360
I understand the urge.

2764
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,880
But specifically the comment that he assumes I know

2765
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,800
that he left and will remember when he mentions it.

2766
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,400
I don't know what he's talking about.

2767
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,680
That you're gonna make a finale.

2768
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:41,120
Just like, call in with the finale and we'll hear it.

2769
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,400
This is so long, so meandering,

2770
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,160
such a waste of fucking time.

2771
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:51,400
Just pussy-footing, apologizing and clarifying

2772
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,880
to these voicemails.

2773
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:56,480
What a more pointless thing could possibly exist.

2774
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,680
You are an autistic, more autistic, more autistic.

2775
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:01,320
You're insane.

2776
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:02,400
You are a psychopath.

2777
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,560
You are a unabomber.

2778
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:04,480
You are a fucking,

2779
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,240
this is just pure constructive criticism,

2780
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,560
no doubt about it, to help the puppet master

2781
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,680
and those like him leave higher quality voicemails

2782
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,520
in the future.

2783
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,440
You're in the fucking voice jail.

2784
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,640
This is literally the fucking worst day of my entire life.

2785
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,080
I guess the people have spoken.

2786
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,840
I guess he's going straight to voicemail.

2787
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:21,680
We are personal inmates.

2788
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,480
I am on a first name basis with you and your mom.

2789
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,920
We're putting the voice puppeteer in the voice jail.

2790
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,400
Okay.

2791
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,960
Okay, let's go to the next one.

2792
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,280
She pollution from the future.

2793
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,240
Oh, this is the person who asked us like our thoughts

2794
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,680
on what would be left in the future.

2795
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,040
Reporting from the future, it seems.

2796
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:40,880
Okay.

2797
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,720
All right, you ready?

2798
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,560
Ready to click?

2799
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:43,400
Ready to click?

2800
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,560
Okay, on the count of three, here we go.

2801
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,320
One, two, three.

2802
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,280
Hello?

2803
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,120
Wow.

2804
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,960
Can you guys hear me?

2805
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,800
He's receiving you, yeah.

2806
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,640
Hello?

2807
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,480
Yes, okay, yes, hello.

2808
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,560
It's me, she pollution from the future.

2809
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,680
I was too curious about if your predictions were correct.

2810
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,480
So I built a time machine.

2811
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,400
So let's see.

2812
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,760
Ben is still in Pito.

2813
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,840
He also got his 26th kidney stone.

2814
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:03,680
Hmm.

2815
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,440
Oh, and Digipro is a father now.

2816
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,640
You guys edit the page material for naming a skate

2817
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,840
like you said you would.

2818
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,320
And well, let's just say that you guys call him Nick

2819
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,840
for short.

2820
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,160
The PSP still exists and your channel is doing great.

2821
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:18,400
You got lots of subscribers when a short clip of hippo

2822
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,200
making a joke became viral.

2823
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,440
Something with apple juice and dogs.

2824
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:25,440
Also, it's in prison for animal abuse.

2825
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:26,480
Okay, so there we go.

2826
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,400
Took that my time machine can only go one year

2827
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,240
into the future.

2828
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,080
Hey.

2829
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,400
Well, see you next year.

2830
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:32,240
Bye.

2831
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,240
What's at the end?

2832
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,000
All right.

2833
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,880
There you go.

2834
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:36,720
One year.

2835
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,160
Sorry, if you are not, if you don't have a proper American

2836
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,760
accent, then you cannot put a voice modulator on.

2837
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,640
You can't do it.

2838
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,760
It's like the double way of me.

2839
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,440
It can make things.

2840
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,360
I mean, every word that was modulated,

2841
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,880
I understood in that.

2842
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:54,600
I heard my name, but I don't know what you said.

2843
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,640
One of you is echoing, by the way.

2844
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,520
It's not me.

2845
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,880
It's a hypocrite, probably.

2846
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,440
It is hypocrite.

2847
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,040
When I'm listening to the things only,

2848
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,960
it's an unfortunate setup.

2849
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,640
I'll cut it out of my ear.

2850
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:06,960
Okay, okay.

2851
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,440
Well, hey, there's Sleet Sheepolution.

2852
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,520
Thanks for the report.

2853
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,200
In a year, we'll look at another year in the future.

2854
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,600
Glad to know the future is bleak,

2855
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,120
just like I expected.

2856
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,360
Called it, hashtag called it.

2857
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,760
All right, let's go to the next one.

2858
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,800
Looking forward to it.

2859
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,320
Okay, oh, here's an interesting one.

2860
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,480
No more shit lectures.

2861
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,280
Let's hear what he has to say.

2862
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,000
All right, on the count of three, here we go.

2863
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,720
One, two, three.

2864
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:34,360
Okay, so what made the original PCP lectures good

2865
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:37,120
is that we had each member's esoteric,

2866
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,600
autistic perspective on this very weird subject

2867
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,240
and how it related to them.

2868
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,320
So we had Nate with his devotion to the Kingdom Hearts

2869
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,640
and how he understood its weird nonsense plot

2870
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,080
across all the games.

2871
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:53,920
About Ben, how he explored Christian as a person

2872
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,560
through Christian's work.

2873
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:58,200
And then Munchy, like, loving performance art

2874
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,400
through Park or Dude91.

2875
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,320
And then the next year, for Adcon 3,

2876
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:05,880
they all deliver utter fucking dog shit.

2877
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,960
Nate just poorly remembers parts of the Final Fantasy games

2878
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,120
and there's no connection there

2879
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:12,640
and just it was boring and useless.

2880
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:15,440
Ben just tells you the plot to a webcomic

2881
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,880
that has Sonic to it.

2882
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,240
So I guess, you know, that's the same,

2883
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,000
even though there's literally nothing interesting

2884
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,320
about what he says.

2885
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,000
And then Munchy just watched a YouTube video once

2886
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,080
and then repeats it back to the audience.

2887
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:28,280
So congratulations, lad.

2888
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,720
You really put in the effort.

2889
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:31,880
You really did the groundwork there.

2890
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,440
Don't fuck it up this year for Adcon 4.

2891
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,960
Actually put the work in.

2892
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,040
If you don't have a lecture to be interesting,

2893
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,440
just don't fucking do one then.

2894
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:44,360
Thank God Digi Tom could save Adcon 3.

2895
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:48,160
So please, don't be shit.

2896
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,360
Yeah, Digi's gonna save Adcon 4.

2897
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,200
No doubt.

2898
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:56,080
I kind of low key agree,

2899
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,240
but I don't think-

2900
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,480
A little bit.

2901
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,680
But did you have to hurt my feelings on the way, sir?

2902
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,640
That's my one question.

2903
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,640
I think, okay, well, both the lectures

2904
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,160
I'm planning on giving, I think are pretty solid.

2905
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,560
So I don't think, I mean,

2906
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,520
I don't think the Tails Gets Trolled Lecture is shit.

2907
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,160
I don't think it's as good as the Sonichu one.

2908
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

2909
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,840
He's probably pointing to that drop off, I guess,

2910
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,640
in some degree. It's good.

2911
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,800
And I think I have some interesting points to make

2912
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,640
about Jennifer Diane Wrights.

2913
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,320
And I think that I have lots to say

2914
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:30,320
about Chris Chan post 2000, whenever it was,

2915
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,080
that the-

2916
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:32,920
Right, right.

2917
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,240
Whenever the last one ended.

2918
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,200
I mean, it's gonna be good.

2919
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,240
Fuck you.

2920
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,440
Maybe I didn't explain it well enough

2921
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,640
in the actual lecture,

2922
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,080
but it's not like I had seen that video recently.

2923
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,160
Like it had been like a driving force between,

2924
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,000
like I had seen it as a kid

2925
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,240
and had continuously come back to it over the years.

2926
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,920
And it's something that I had ruminated on

2927
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,120
various, many different times.

2928
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,560
So the human history lecture didn't come out

2929
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,800
like the ether like a couple of weeks beforehand.

2930
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,000
It was, I mean, maybe I didn't come through the lecture

2931
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,680
and therefore it made it worse because of it,

2932
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:02,760
but like it was definitely not like random

2933
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,600
or like I watched a YouTube video.

2934
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,280
I watched a very important YouTube video

2935
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,080
and then I reached out.

2936
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,560
Hey, true, true.

2937
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,720
Yeah, all right.

2938
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,120
These are fair points.

2939
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,960
Keep in mind.

2940
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,840
All right, anyway, let's go to the next one.

2941
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,880
We've got Mass Effect Mouth Noises.

2942
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,000
Okay, let's do it.

2943
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,480
On the count of three, here we go.

2944
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,120
One, two, three.

2945
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,640
All right, Mr. Bestman.

2946
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:28,280
I have a complaint from last week's episode.

2947
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:34,280
You claimed that Mass Effect 3 was a bad finale

2948
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:38,680
when really only the very ending was a letdown

2949
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:41,920
and the rest of the game and its multiplayer

2950
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,880
were received pretty well.

2951
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:47,000
What's your take on that?

2952
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I voiced jail, I hate this person.

2953
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:53,240
I think, isn't Tom the only one of us

2954
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,160
who's actually played Mass Effect?

2955
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:56,360
I have not played Mass Effect.

2956
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,840
I'm repeating, I played a, look, was I not clear?

2957
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,480
Everything I know comes from

2958
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,840
Mr. B. Tung's review videos.

2959
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:08,280
Did you play Mass Effect, Jesse played Mass Effect?

2960
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:10,000
That's true, none of them are here

2961
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,840
who actually played the game.

2962
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,360
Why does this person exist?

2963
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,800
Why did he do this?

2964
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,920
What did he hope to be?

2965
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:18,280
Yeah, what a strange small complaint.

2966
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:21,960
This is the, you know, I'm sure there were people out there.

2967
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,080
These people always exist.

2968
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,080
That like when a wave of criticism appears,

2969
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,360
there's the people who are like, you know,

2970
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,040
and you know, maybe they're literally correct.

2971
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,960
They're like, sure guys,

2972
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,880
your point about that one specific thing is fair,

2973
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,960
but there's all this other good stuff.

2974
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,920
Like I could believe that.

2975
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,240
It's just, it seems like,

2976
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:39,960
wasn't the entire promise from the beginning of Mass Effect

2977
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,160
was a big story where things would,

2978
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,760
your decisions would matter in the end and like,

2979
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,360
okay, everything else, let's say, was great about the game.

2980
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,040
But when that, you could, I think it's fair to say

2981
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:53,160
the most important thing, at least relating to the story,

2982
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,160
and it's a story-based fucking game,

2983
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,120
turns out to, they actually didn't plan it out

2984
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,680
and it made basically no difference.

2985
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:03,440
I mean, at that point, it seems like fair to be like,

2986
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,440
can you call it a failure?

2987
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,800
I mean, everyone's got their definition, I guess, but.

2988
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,480
I don't know, I don't feel comfortable speculating

2989
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:10,840
having not played it.

2990
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,400
I mean. Yeah, fair enough.

2991
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,160
We shouldn't even talk about it.

2992
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:16,280
We have nothing to say about it.

2993
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:18,480
It's really stupid, it doesn't even fucking matter.

2994
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,320
And this guy is stupid.

2995
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:21,280
Fucking Mass Effect mouth noises.

2996
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,960
Never call here again.

2997
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,200
Yeah.

2998
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:25,840
Voice jail, voice jail, huh?

2999
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,160
Yeah, I don't feel that strongly about it.

3000
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,400
I'm feeling pretty generous today.

3001
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,880
Voice jail, I'm feeling pretty generous.

3002
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,600
I'm feeling generous.

3003
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,280
No, that's giving him too much credit.

3004
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,080
I don't care, whatever, let's move on to the next one.

3005
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,360
We can actually shout later.

3006
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,040
All right, Zolpher is our last words.

3007
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:41,680
We can have another six hour meeting about it.

3008
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,280
Yeah, we'll have that, that'll be good, that'll be good.

3009
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,600
All right, Zolpher is our final one for the day.

3010
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,120
Let's see how he does.

3011
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,120
Okay, one, two, three.

3012
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:50,760
I did it, PCP.

3013
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,520
I lost my virginity.

3014
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:55,800
I completed my love quest by listening to your podcast.

3015
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,680
Yeah. Thank you.

3016
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,720
Here's how I did it.

3017
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,440
Step one, I went to Animate Club.

3018
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,280
Nice.

3019
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,360
Step two, I approached a cute, quiet girl

3020
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,640
that was just by herself.

3021
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,480
You said you're gorgeous.

3022
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,440
This car knocks me for the sake of this story

3023
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:12,000
or just not see for short.

3024
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,160
Step three, the most important step,

3025
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:16,480
I didn't talk to her about Animate.

3026
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,080
We talked about philosophy, poetry,

3027
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,920
love, our dreams for the future.

3028
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,840
She wants to be a pediatrician,

3029
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,320
but she's failed to cause entrance exams seven times.

3030
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:29,880
I asked her why she can't pass a test.

3031
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,480
Biology, she says, I'm really bad at anatomy.

3032
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,920
A bell rang in my head.

3033
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,080
I knew exactly what to say.

3034
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,960
I look into her eyes and I just say,

3035
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,720
I'll teach you what I know.

3036
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,800
Well done.

3037
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,520
Wow, wow, okay.

3038
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,360
Unbelievable.

3039
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,240
Munchie, I think you think that that's a real story,

3040
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:52,440
but it was clearly a joke story.

3041
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,840
Yeah, that actually makes it really good now, actually.

3042
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,000
That actually completely changed me.

3043
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,960
In that case, I'm very entertained.

3044
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:00,800
Yeah.

3045
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,080
Guys, we have to have an intervention here.

3046
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,840
What is happening right now?

3047
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,160
Nate, why are you like this?

3048
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,440
Why does this happen?

3049
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,920
Hey, just consider these were the best of the bunch.

3050
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:11,760
I mean, you know.

3051
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,600
Just pick better ones.

3052
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,720
There are no better ones.

3053
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:15,720
You heard the best ones.

3054
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,040
Then pick zero.

3055
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,720
Yeah, none.

3056
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,560
We could have.

3057
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,400
We don't need to have more than one ship.

3058
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,240
Guys, guys, guys.

3059
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,880
Listen, your complaints are totally worthless

3060
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,120
and I don't care.

3061
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,180
You just do this unpaid job,

3062
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:29,780
then you'll have nothing to complain about.

3063
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:30,620
You do get paid.

3064
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,120
No, not for this, no I don't.

3065
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:32,960
You get the ad?

3066
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,480
Okay, fine, fine.

3067
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,080
We've been over this many times.

3068
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,280
Okay, well, listen,

3069
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,800
I'm gonna fucking slap you on the wrist

3070
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,640
and say do better.

3071
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,800
That's the only thing I have the authority to do.

3072
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,080
That's, I suppose that's fair.

3073
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:48,680
And I'm gonna fucking work it to the best of my ability.

3074
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,520
All right, that's it.

3075
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,480
We're done with this shit.

3076
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,480
I'm ready to get the fuck out of here.

3077
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:53,800
Please improve voicemails.

3078
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,120
I'm sure you don't have to read Confor.

3079
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,960
Wait, wait, wait.

3080
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:56,800
We're not actually done.

3081
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:57,640
Please shut up.

3082
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,600
Assuming that it exists yet and nobody knows.

3083
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,760
Speak, pipe, link, voicemails,

3084
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,880
please leave ones that are improved.

3085
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:06,600
Or don't honestly, don't leave a voicemail, please.

3086
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:07,600
Please fucking joke.

3087
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,480
Just leave the cream of the crop.

3088
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,280
Do your thing, do your thing.

3089
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,080
We don't need your whole life story.

3090
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,120
We don't need your whole every, you know,

3091
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:17,480
fucking voicemail you left in your whole fucking life.

3092
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,320
What do you say at the beginning?

3093
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,640
Just amuse us.

3094
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:20,800
It's still nap time.

3095
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,120
It's been nap time this whole time.

3096
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:23,800
It's really a loud nap time.

3097
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,960
All right, but as they were saying,

3098
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,560
pick your read Confor Kickstarter.

3099
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,460

3101
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:33,040
Either out now or out soon.

3102
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,320
Soon at the latest.

3103
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,440
So keep your eyes fucking peeled on this channel.

3104
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,440

It is, Endless War was a pre-alpha for Lonesome Cactus.

3117
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,440
It's literally true.

3118
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,960
This is gonna eclipse it completely.

3119
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,240
And go to QuickDruck because there's gonna be

3120
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:09,080
a bunch of shit.

3121
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:10,720
It already is shit now.

3122
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:13,200
And there will be more, because yeah.

3123
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:15,760
I'll also say, I guess while we're on this,

more videos from me, go check out my shit.

3125
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,080
But more importantly, right now.

3126
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,520
Hey guys, Morweaga was on the way guys, yeah.

3127
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,200
On the canton channel, we just did our big

3128
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:27,040
seasonal anime wrap up that people always enjoy.

3129
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,760

Everybody likes it.

3133
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,320
Nate, I'm gonna racially profile you.

3134
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,400
Hey, I got a little bit of news.

3135
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,680
I got a little bit of funny news this week,

3136
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,520
just yesterday, or maybe the day before.

3137
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:41,360
You should fuck off.

3138
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,240
The Sonichu Lecture hit a million views.

3139
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,400
Oh, that's right.

3140
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,240
Pretty cool.

3141
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,080
Congratulations.

3142
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,040
Now nobody can watch it again.

3143
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,040
It has to stay there.

3144
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,720
I got that nice M under the thumbnail.

3145
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:53,440
You got that nice W in life.

3146
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,280
What?

3147
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,120
It's a win, Ben.

3148
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:55,960
It's a win.

3149
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:56,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3150
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,040
This is what the Urban News say, yeah.

3151
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:59,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3152
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,400
I know all about them.

3153
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,240
They've adopted me.

3154
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,080
All right, that's it.

3155
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:02,920
That's what's up.

3156
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,760
We're done, everybody.

3157
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,800
Hey, patreon.com slash theprocrastinaires,

3158
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,640
support the show.

3159
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:11,040
$5, get the bonus episodes, $1, fucking Discord,

3160
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,320
and hang out with us, blah, blah, blah,

3161
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,280
but give us more money.

3162
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,840
And also, PSB Minecraft, I'm sure it'll be back up

3163
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,080
by the time you see this.

3164
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:18,800
Hopefully, we'll see about that.

3165
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,280
Oh, my God, is it not back up yet?

3166
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,120
Oh, no.

3167
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:24,320
We're currently waiting for shock bite to fix it.

3168
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,960
It's the problem on their side.

3169
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,200
We are convinced of this.

3170
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,720
They got to fix some bullshit.

3171
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:29,960
And hopefully they'll give us money,

3172
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:33,240
but they won't because they're clearly cheap motherfuckers.

3173
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,920
But we'll see what's up.

3174
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:37,840
It's not our fault, but we'll have it fixed soon.

3175
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,920
Play Minecraft.

3176
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,760
It's a good time.

3177
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,600
All right, we're done.

3178
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,440
We're out of here.

3179
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,280
We'll see you next week, everybody.

3180
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,400
Rack on four.

3181
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,240
Pay us money.

3182
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,060
We could use it.

3183
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,880
Thank you very much.

3184
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,720
All right, we're out of here.

3185
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,560
Later.

3186
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,720
Bye.

3187
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,560
Bye.
