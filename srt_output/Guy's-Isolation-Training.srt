00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,360
It is 11.25pm on Wednesday, January 4th, 2017.

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:40,840
I just got back from my 5k run. I did my nightly pull ups and I am glowing like a god. I feel

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:51,280
great. I feel really great. This is Nate's isolation training. Maybe I'll go with Guy's

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,360
isolation training. I don't know. I'm flip flopping between those two a lot. I haven't

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,160
really gotten comfortable calling myself Guy, even though I came up with it. Guys like Digi

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,440
and Gibb the whole time I've known them. I've called them that one name. Now it's kind of

7
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,400
funny to like Gibb change his name to Hippocrit with his new channel. It's been tough for

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,120
me to sort of shift with that and call him Hippo with his new name. And it's even harder

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,200
for me to start calling myself the new name I gave myself because I've known myself for

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,440
so long. So I don't know what I'll end up naming this exactly, but we'll see. Recently,

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,720
as I'm sure a lot of people know, I've had some things in my life that have wrapped up.

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,440
There have been some big changes. And now feels like a really good time to decompress,

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,120
you know, especially after the holidays. When I got to go home, see my folks hang out with

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:04,200
my family and see some friends from home, check in on what everybody's doing. And you know,

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,240
it kind of feels like it's a shift to a new chapter in my life, which, you know, if you

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
follow along with the things I say in PCP and whatnot, I'm sure that you're aware of

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,680
this. You know, it's kind of like, it's kind of like in my favorite game of all time, Final

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:30,400
Fantasy 15. It's like I've entered a new chapter. And the old one is getting left behind, going

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:41,640
to a new chapter, new things are happening, just like that perfect game. So I do a lot

20
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,640
of exercising. And actually, you know, we did the fat fuckery podcast recently. And I really

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,120
enjoyed doing that and getting to talk about, you know, my relationship with exercise and

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,640
dieting and that kind of stuff. I never intended to come across really as well, I probably

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,680
did intend to come across as like a real hardcore expert or someone who's who's incredibly

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,440
good at sticking to the advice that intellectually he knows is the right way to operate. Because

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,960
I have faults in that as well, you know, all of one, not all of, but actually the last year,

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,360
like, like the end of 2015 and 2016, when I moved out to Ohio for my new job. And that

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,920
was also the time that I was really starting to crank out heavy duty work on on my big

28
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:50,360
videos on best guy ever. That was a time when exercise and, you know, like health consciousness

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,960
definitely decreased in priority in my life, because I was so dedicated to getting those

30
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,880
videos done in all in in all my spare time was devoted to that in addition to, you know,

31
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,920
having to go to school and working full time. And then, you know, as you know, I finished

32
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,280
school, which is fantastic just a couple weeks ago. But during that time, my exercise

33
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,400
routine suffered. And there's no way around it. I gained some weight. And I lost some

34
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,040
muscle, you know, it's it's just true. I was at a peak of my life, probably around two

35
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,080
years ago, you know, before I started doing all the stuff intensely, health and fitness

36
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,680
peak of my life. It was awesome. It was wonderful. And I am definitely not at a p at that peak

37
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
right now. Now is the time where I'm now that I've got more time, I'm working on getting

38
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,240
back to that point, and surpassing it. But, you know, this is a lower point than that.

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I'm no longer in a valley. I'm not at a nadir, as opposed to a zenith for you English majors

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,280
out there. I'm not at the lowest point. I'm currently on a rise, which feels great. But

41
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,480
you know, my point is just that I'm not perfect at this stuff, you know. And but but all this

42
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,720
is just a preface for something I wanted to talk about, which was that a guy I know, someone

43
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,440
who watches who watch this podcast, the fat fuckery podcast, somebody reached out to me

44
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,880
who had watched it. And I won't say who it is, just to protect privacy, even though,

45
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,960
I mean, I mean, if I were them, I would want this screen from the rooftops, because it's

46
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,160
so awesome. But this one guy messaged me and told me that that podcast, and specifically

47
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the things I was talking about in it, were so resonated with him so strongly that he

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,320
was able to, I mean, I don't know if it was immediate or not, but was able to from that

49
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,880
point on, and I don't know how many months ago that was now, was able to make a change

50
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,120
in his life. And I think it was mostly dietary. And I believe he said he lost around, I don't

51
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,480
want to exaggerate, but I honestly think he said 100 pounds. I believe it was about 100

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,760
pounds that he lost. It might have been 50. I feel bad not remembering the exact amount.

53
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,400
But this is a math, even 50 pounds, like holy shit. And this was in the span of like, it

54
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,120
was less than six months. Let's just be conservative and say he lost 50 pounds in six months. That's

55
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,320
insane. That's fantastic. And this guy came to me and said, you know, Nate guy, whatever,

56
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,520
you really inspired me to make this change in my life. And I think he said thank you

57
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,240
or something. And you know, you know what that made me think? That made me think for

58
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:54,840
once in my life. I got to be the role model. I got to be, you know, the Kamina, who was

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,880
inspiring somebody else to be, you know, to live up to their potential, to do something

60
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,280
that they didn't necessarily know they could do. And God, Jesus Christ, I just don't know

61
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,400
if there's anything that would ever feel better than that, than to help to make a positive

62
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,680
change in someone's life like that. And obviously I'm not trying to take full credit. This,

63
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,480
this, this hero fucking did it himself. But to be a part of the process for that, you

64
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,840
know, to advocate what I would consider generally positive changes people can make in their

65
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,600
lives and to see someone follow through and succeed and be grateful and happy and better

66
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,360
and healthier for it. There's just nothing better than that. So, you know, I was just

67
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
out running middle of the fucking night. I got home from work, you know, had had shit

68
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,760
to do. It's fucking, it's, I should have gone to bed half an hour ago. Instead went for

69
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,840
a run. Because, you know, when it's the time of day to do your exercise, there ain't nothing

70
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,040
to it, but to do it, you know, just, just a really validating story. You know, I don't

71
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,600
even mean to talk about me. I'm just talking about the principle of, of applying yourself

72
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,440
and God, it's just, it just, it feels so good to be able to help other people to make a

73
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,800
positive change. Because that is really what my entire YouTube presence is about, at least

74
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,480
on Best Guy Ever. You know, every video I post on there, well, aside from the shit posts,

75
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,480
which there are plenty of, to be fair. All, I mean, all of like the scripted videos I

76
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,000
write, I like to think they all have a central message. And, you know, I like to cite Huey's

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,680
Law as I call it, the rule from the Christmas episode of the Boondocks, one of my favorite

78
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,920
shows when Huey's like, if people want to see my vision, nobody's going to give a fuck.

79
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,920
You got to dress it up with special effects and flair and songs and Hollywood movie stars.

80
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,520
You got to dress up. You got to, you got to put candy around the medicine if you want

81
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,640
people to swallow it. But I do think that there is that medicine, at least in my opinion,

82
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,240
contained in my videos that I want people to get. Because I do, I'm a really strong

83
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,000
advocate for humanism. I mean, I don't really like to attach myself to any particular movement,

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but I just mean for, I value human life. And I want humanity to succeed and foster itself

85
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,800
and grow. And I like to think the messages that I put in my shit, you know, have that

86
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,560
effect. I mean, one of the big reasons that I wanted to do this today was because I just

87
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,440
finished my Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer video, which I was really secretive about

88
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,960
and I didn't tell anybody about until it was just about done, except Mr. Donut the Donut,

89
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,760
big shout out to him, who inspired the way that the video was edited. I wouldn't have

90
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,600
done it if I hadn't seen his Jojo videos, which I love, especially his white snake, fuckin'

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,920
white snake. Here I go again on my own, going down the only road I've ever known.

92
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,560
Fuckin' Enrico Pucci is my fuckin' nigga. I love that dude. Way to go, Donut, you killed

93
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,560
it. I wanted to decompress about how intense the editing process was for that. I mean,

94
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,200
there's a couple things I wanted to talk about it. Before I get into that, I've noticed that

95
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm a really extreme guy when it comes to the way I attune myself to things, and that

96
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,520
once I'm focused on a particular task, it's really hard for me to multitask, if you know

97
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,520
what I mean, in the sense of, like, when I was getting close to finishing that video,

98
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,800
and for me, that video took about two and a half months of straight working every single

99
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,880
night editing. To be fair, Christmas vacation, I was away, so I didn't work every single

100
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,880
night, but worked many, many hours on that project. Towards the end, I'm so focused on

101
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,240
just getting it done, getting it done, gotta get it out, gotta move on to the next project.

102
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,880
Time is ticking, you have to finish it, you have to finish it, that I sort of give up

103
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,640
things like cooking myself healthy meals, because I think, no, I can't spend the time

104
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,600
doing that, I need to be editing right now, I can't waste time, I'll just fuckin' order

105
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,600
up whatever. Fuckin' Crangoonz. That's Crab Rangoonz, there was a Chinese food menu

106
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,360
at my house that said Crangoonz on it, I've always loved that. Fuckin' Crangoonz, dawg!

107
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Have you ever seen me buy me some Crangoonz? I'll love you forever. Yeah, like why would

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,360
I spend time cooking myself a fuckin' healthy meal, making my delicious protein shake, that'll

109
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,640
take up two whole minutes of my life, I could be editing, just fuckin' order something, or

110
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,920
spend an hour exercising, really, when I could spend that hour, you know, photoshopping fucking

111
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,240
two panels from this fuckin' massive project I'm doing right now, I can't justify that

112
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,720
time, I need to be editing right now, you know, like that's the way my mind goes, and

113
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,120
I've noticed this pattern, you know, I talked before about how my exercise routine has suffered,

114
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,800
you know, for a while it's suffered, you know, it's better now, but it's suffered because

115
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,800
I would trick myself sort of, my mind would play tricks on itself to make me think that

116
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,800
oh, I can't exercise today, I need to fucking be editing right now, you know, my ability

117
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,240
to divide up my time in a healthy way diminishes as my urgency to complete a project increases,

118
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,880
you know what I mean? I've noticed that, you know, ever since, even since the first

119
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,760
Guren Logan video, Guren Logan part one, you know how I edited that thing, I would, I was

120
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,560
using my old laptop for that, and I went to the library where my parents wouldn't bug

121
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,440
me, because I was living at home and I was making it on my shitty fucking laptop, and

122
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,120
I would go to the library and sit down there all night and just edit clips together on

123
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,880
that piece of shit laptop that barely even worked, you know, I didn't even know that

124
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Vegas, I was watching clips in like full resolution, and I didn't turn down the, like the little

125
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,880
preview window to like quarter resolution, which allows you to actually play it properly,

126
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,160
so I was just fucking like, I would have to render a clip and then watch it to see if

127
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,920
the timing worked, it's fucking whatever. The point is, like, all my time was just spent

128
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,440
at that fucking library editing, that's what I did, and my, my, you know, exercise routine

129
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,400
suffered, and then once that project was done, oh, I was free, and you know, I could start

130
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,880
preparing to work on part two, and then, you know, my exercise routine got way better,

131
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,640
got much better again, and you know, that was just the start of this, but now I've been

132
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,920
doing these intensive editing projects straight for almost two years, like a year and a half,

133
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,200
or so, and it's, it's not a good cycle of, of like managing the important things I need

134
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,520
to do in my life, you know, I, I've given up a lot of other things to focus on editing,

135
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,200
and I'm aware that it's having negative effects in other aspects of my life in various ways,

136
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,120
but those are all acceptable to me, but the exercise one is not acceptable to me, and

137
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,400
that's why I, I need to make some changes in the way that I, that I structure my time,

138
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,800
you know, I really feel like The Procrastinators is the perfect channel for me, because I have

139
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,840
never met anyone, you can talk to my friends, I have never met anyone who is a worst procrastinator

140
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,840
in the sense that you get things done generally, but at the absolute last possible second,

141
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,480
are you aware, of course you're not aware, I've never, I don't talk about this, but

142
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,480
I finished all my assignments this last semester as a fucking, you know, super senior guy finishing

143
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,480
my degree in my last class here, every single assignment was turned in the hour it was due

144
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,600
or later, or later than the due date, and luckily, like in this particular class they

145
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,520
didn't mind, but I've had classes where people did mind, and then, you know, then you have

146
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,520
to play the whole dance of like, oh I'm so sorry, like, oh I thought it was due late,

147
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,520
like I've been a real shitty, you know, time management guy as long as I can remember,

148
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,200
and it's my biggest flaw personally, and it stretches into other ways, you know, like,

149
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,840
I think that it's the same problem that I have with my ability to, you know, like budget

150
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,480
when I get close to the end of an editing project, like how much time I need to be editing,

151
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,280
and then, you know, Nate, take the fucking hour to go exercise, you know, I think that

152
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,780
these are all a manifestation of the same, same kind of weakness of, you know, an ability

153
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:10,680
to structure a schedule effectively, I'm really a one track kind of guy, which by the way

154
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,680
makes me a great editor, as everybody can see, because I so autistically focus in on

155
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,000
whatever I've decided is the thing that I have to do, and when it's done, generally

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,600
pretty fucking good, but, you know, it comes at a cost, you know, other shit gets neglected,

157
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I really am a, you know, an artist in the sense that I need a rich, gay, Italian lover

158
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,440
slash patron to, to be my patron as an artist, so we can have gay sex, you know, like I'm

159
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,640
referencing Michelangelo, if you're not getting the reference here, and the Pope, I think

160
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,160
they were gay lovers, right, that's fact that's confirmed, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's confirmed.

161
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,000
You know, if I can just focus on the thing that I want to do, I'm pretty darn good at

162
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,120
it, if I, if I do say so myself, hey quick aside, when I was out on my run today, I found

163
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,120
not one, but two potatoes on the ground, and I'm holding them in my hands, they are completely

164
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,120
frozen solid, how's that for focus, fuck boys, where's I going with that, whatever, not important,

165
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,280
oh yeah, I'm just decompressing about the whole, my whole experience of YouTubeing and

166
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,600
making the Biscuit Hammer video, you know, it's really, it's revealing to me more and

167
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,600
more the way that I operate on YouTube, and the ways that that isn't optimal, you know,

168
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,760
I've talked about this many times, I think in various PCP episodes, so I'm, I don't

169
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,760
need to dwell on it too much, but that project was a vast sinkhole of time, two and a half

170
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:06,160
months, that, you know, just isn't the most efficient way to spend your time on YouTube,

171
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,280
not to mention, it's a niche thing, like it's a, it's a fucking AMV, you know, an MMV

172
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I guess, Manga Music Video, for a series that's not particularly popular, but you know, I,

173
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,000
I just really identify with it, hey you know what sucks about that, that I want everyone

174
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,960
to die, who says this, everyone who fucking comments on that video, wow, great video dude,

175
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,720
or even, or it just skips that part and gets straight to, you guys should read Spirit Circle,

176
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,080
Spirit Circle is the latest manga by Satoshi Mizukami, the guy who made Lucifer and the

177
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,160
Biscuit Hammer, we're not here to talk about fucking Spirit Circle, you fucking idiots,

178
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,920
we're here to talk about Lucifer and the fucking Biscuit Hammer, everyone who fucking commented

179
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,920
about Spirit Circle, shut the fuck up and die, I hate you guys, I don't hate you guys,

180
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,480
I just wish you would focus on the matter at hand, I didn't make a fucking video about

181
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,240
Spirit Circle, okay, I made a video about Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, because it's one

182
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,160
of my favorite manga, and Spirit Circle, I've read about half of it, okay, it does not focus,

183
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,320
it's not like these things are interchangeable, like oh if you like, if you like Lucifer and

184
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,040
the Biscuit Hammer, just read Spirit Circle, like it's, it's, it's the new one, so it

185
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,280
just replaces it, no, that's fucking not how it works, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer

186
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,200
is fucking great, and I wish you fucking people talking about Spirit Circle, we just make

187
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,600
your own fucking Spirit Circle video, and then comment all your shit on that, okay,

188
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,120
just keep it off of my shit, god damn it, god, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is too

189
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,480
good to be ignored by discussions about fucking the new work by the guy, okay, I like Spirit

190
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,040
Circle, it's, it's, it's good, I haven't finished it, I can't say that it's great, because

191
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,720
I haven't gotten, I don't know, I don't feel like it's really earned, it's, it's, it's

192
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,400
weight yet, as like, you know, because I love this series, I don't feel like it's reached

193
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,440
that bar with the place I got to, I don't, I don't know how far I got into it, I'm lying,

194
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,320
I didn't get halfway, I just, I read like, I don't know, 20 chapters or something, just

195
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,800
everybody chill out about Spirit Circle, okay, can we please, you know, the biggest disappointment

196
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,760
for me about that, about that video is that there isn't more, and you know, to be fair,

197
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,160
I get it, I understand why, because it's the nature of the video, it's kind of just a,

198
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,160
a really quick, emotional dive into Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, as opposed to like,

199
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,560
what I, what I'm tempted to do, because I'm not getting enough of this, but like a, you

200
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,800
know, like my Tengentubba girl log in part two, I would, I'd like to do a, someday I

201
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,280
probably won't, but maybe I will, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, part two video, where

202
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,240
I like, really talk in depth about the themes of the, of the manga, and what it means, and

203
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,520
why it's so important to me as a person, because that is a very important series to me as

204
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,240
a person, really, oh god, it, it doesn't really come across that much in the, in the video

205
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,280
that I made, there's, there's so much about that series that I couldn't capture, that

206
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,920
oh, it, you know, you know, it's like, no matter what AMV you make of any show, or any manga,

207
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
you're never going to capture everything that you love about it.

208
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,960
And just one of the things I couldn't capture about that series was, in the video, you do

209
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,280
see Amamiya's, or Yuhi's transformation from like his self-hating, you know, kind of an

210
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,480
asshole weirdo creeper who wouldn't mind if the world got destroyed into, you know, like

211
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,320
a guy who lives for his lady, has real genuine friendships with people, you know, has father

212
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,180
figures that come and go, and is able to make a positive contribution to the world emotionally

213
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,440
and practically, by fucking, you know, saving the fucking world, fuck yeah, Lizard Knight,

214
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,880
but it's, there's this other part about him, there, there's a lot of physical training

215
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,320
that goes on in that series, I was fucking out running today, Amamiya Yuhi goes out running

216
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,560
every single morning with the princess, every day, in Lucifer and the Biscayne Hammer, they

217
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,160
go for a fucking run, alright, and it's to build up their stamina, because their, their

218
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,680
ring power is the domain control, psychic power, ball things that you don't see much

219
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,000
of in my video, those, the more stamina you have, the more endurance you have, like the

220
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,840
stronger your domain is, like the longer you can use it, and also, later on in the series,

221
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,960
he gets, I wish I really tried to include this, there just wasn't enough space, Yuhi

222
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,200
gets really into digging holes, like he just, out of the blue, out of the fucking blue,

223
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,120
he develops the habit of digging trap holes all over this fucking mountain, and he starts

224
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,200
doing it, and he gets fucking ripped, just he goes out every day, and he digs fucking

225
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,040
holes, just like, you know, like the movie holes, only he covers them up, and it's used

226
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:53,300
for fucking like emotional payoffs, as well as gags, like the idea is that he'll dig holes

227
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,240
to, you know, get stronger, it's his form of exercise, as well as, it's a meditative

228
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,280
thing, it's an exercise thing, and it's also a practical, you know, like trap hole, like

229
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,000
when they're fighting the golems, maybe one will step in one, and it'll, you know, help

230
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,600
them in the fight somehow, and God, I fucking love it, but, but it's the training that Yuhi

231
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,120
goes through, oh God, I just love, you know, you know, guys, I want me at Yuhi, he starts

232
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,800
that series, the weakest fuck, right, me, I started running seriously about four or five

233
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:32,160
months ago, I think after, I had gone for a long time, I'd still been working out sparingly,

234
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,600
but I got, I got really into running again, and now I'm doing 5Ks pretty frequently, and

235
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm going for 10K, just like, even though that's, even if a 5K is not that impressive,

236
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,840
but, well, let me put it in context, when I started running a couple months ago, like

237
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,440
my ankles, and I had never felt this before, because I used to run a lot, but my ankles

238
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,680
were so weak, they were like the limiting factor when I tried to go for a run, like

239
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,680
as I would be out running, I wouldn't get exhausted, my ankles would specifically give

240
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,640
out, like when you're doing curls, and your bicep gives out, and you just can't do another

241
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,880
fucking curl, my ankles would just, I couldn't lift my leg to, or, you know, to move my fucking

242
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,080
foot to run anymore, that was the limiting factor on them, it was, it was weird, I had

243
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,600
never felt that before, but now, several months later, no problems, my ankles are totally

244
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,880
fine, and that was like a real problem for like a month when I was running, but God,

245
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:31,000
it feels so good to set yourself a goal like that, and to achieve it, to get past it, which

246
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,800
is why I fucking love exercising, I feel so good, every time I exercise when I'm doing

247
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,920
it, it's hard, doesn't, don't really love the actual doing of it, but afterward, feels

248
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,760
fantastic, and you know what, I do love doing it, like every set is a struggle, obviously,

249
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,640
but once you put the set down, and you can just bask in what you've just accomplished,

250
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,120
ugh, it's great, everyone, I hope everyone feels it, ugh, boy, a little bit rambly, hope

251
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,520
you forgive me, I feel like everything here is fairly related, more or less, you know,

252
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
in the same ballpark here, is there anything else I wanted to say about my fucking video

253
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,760
there, no, no, I guess I'm a little disappointed with the views, I mean, you know, my channel

254
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,240
is not that big, I understand, I knew from the get-go that that video wasn't, you know,

255
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,000
it's not like I was making a drama video, now that's what I need to do to get the views,

256
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,680
it's a little art piece, you know, I think that my patrons probably appreciate it a lot,

257
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,760
because it's the, I feel like it's new content for me, and it's a whole new fucking art form

258
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,200
that I've never done before, and I really loved it, thanks again Mr. Donut for inspiring

259
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,000
it, yeah, I don't know, I just think that my particular brand on Best Guy Ever is gonna

260
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,360
grow as time goes on fairly, I mean, if I kept doing what I had been doing, it'd be slow,

261
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,680
but I think I'm gonna make a couple changes, hopefully it'll go faster, we'll see, hopefully

262
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,280
the quality will remain high, I mean, it's me, come on son, you know I'm gonna be high

263
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:10,000
quality, yeah, I guess there's one other thing I kind of wanted to talk about that relates

264
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,080
to some of the stuff I've been saying here, I was just thinking about the kind of characters

265
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,320
I gravitate to a lot, I don't know how much, I know I've talked about this to some extent

266
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,280
in PCPs, but you know, I was just thinking about Kill Bill, the bride, you know, the

267
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:36,760
snake boys, that whole bunch, nah, but really I was thinking about Bill, Bill himself, there's

268
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,160
a line in Kill Bill, it's not really a line, it's just a concept about the character Bill

269
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,600
that someone says, I think Esteban, whatever, the Spanish dude, Mexican, I don't know, the

270
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,880
guy that is in Kill Bill part two, who tells the bride where Bill is finally, what's her

271
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,040
name, Beatrix Kiddo, that's right, when Kiddo goes to meet this guy, he was like a mentor

272
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,400
of Bill's growing up, and I don't really know exactly what their relationship was, but they

273
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,960
hung out, you know, and he says something interesting about Bill that's really stuck

274
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,840
with me over the years, and it was that, I think he said that Bill and his brother Bud

275
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,520
were orphans, I think he said that, but I know he definitely said, Bill collected father

276
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,840
figures, ever since I heard that line, I just felt such a strong kinship with that, you

277
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,800
know, I don't know if everybody gets that, but I know exactly what that means, and I

278
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,320
mean maybe Bill didn't have a father, and that's why he, you know, quote unquote collected

279
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,920
father figures, but I really feel like that sort of idea is why I'm so into anime, and

280
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:52,720
the specific things that I gravitate towards, you know, I of course have a dad, and he is

281
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,080
a wonderful dad, and I love him with all my heart, but he's not perfect, you know, no

282
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:07,200
dad is, my dad is a very emotionally, I don't know, I don't want to paint him in the wrong

283
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,120
way, you know, like a lot of the time, mothers are the more emotional person, I think between

284
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,280
two parents, at least it seemed to me, and fathers are a little bit more, I mean not

285
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,280
even that they're more disciplined, but they're more, they're more like a teacher, you know,

286
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,000
as opposed to a friend, you know what I mean, a little more strict, you know, and my dad,

287
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,880
you know, was kind of strict, I guess, but my dad was definitely the more emotional one,

288
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,560
I hope I'm not fucking going too deep right now, too real, but whatever, I don't think

289
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,600
I'm going to say anything that's going to hurt anybody's feelings, my dad was definitely

290
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,600
the more emotionally connected of my two parents, you know, my dad's a psychologist, so I'm

291
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,560
sure empathy is his fucking business, you know, it's his deal to connect emotionally

292
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,640
and do that shit, and my mom is just, you know, I don't even, I don't want to say emotionally

293
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,600
distant, that sounds negative, I just mean that she was a little more, you know, private

294
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,800
of a person, and she was always there for me when I was real sad, and when I needed somebody,

295
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,480
but it's just not really in her nature to, like, what I'm trying to illustrate here is

296
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,720
just that I think when I was growing up, and this has a point, this relates to anime, your

297
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:27,640
favorite thing viewer, so hang in there, I think when I was growing up, like, I didn't

298
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,600
have anybody who was like really cool in my life, you know, like I don't think I had a

299
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:43,560
strong positive male role model in the sense of like a badass, you know, like my dad was

300
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,800
a wonderful father, a fantastic person, but I wouldn't exactly call him a badass, and

301
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,160
actually it's really funny, as I've gotten older, and I learn more about his history,

302
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,840
and I see him spend more time with like his brothers, because he's got a whole bunch of

303
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,360
brothers, and I see him do things that I don't think he would have showed when I was younger,

304
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,840
I see like the badass part of my dad come out more and more, which is kind of ironic,

305
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,080
as he gets older, he gets more of a badass, at least in my eyes, but like there wasn't

306
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,640
as much of that when I was young, and I'm not trying to complain, I'm just describing

307
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,600
reality for me, this is not a complaint, but when I look back at the guy that I am now,

308
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:28,440
and why I am this way, I do think that I didn't have someone in my life who I could emulate

309
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:37,000
to be cool, you know, and being cool is so important to me, and it's not that I choose

310
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that I want that for myself, it's kind of just instinct, and it's not even that I really

311
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,520
think that I am that cool, it's that I want to be cool, and so I project that I think

312
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:55,440
I am cool, oh god we're getting deep here, this is a little more than I bargained for,

313
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,200
fuck it, fuck it, so what I'm trying to say is, I think I filled that hole in myself,

314
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,000
and hey for all I know, everyone in the world feels exactly the same, you know, maybe everyone

315
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,120
can relate to this, I'm not trying to say I'm the only one who felt like this, because

316
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,200
I had a great life growing up, but everyone's got things that are deficient, you know, excesses

317
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,840
of some things, deficiencies of others, in my case, I think I could have used some more

318
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:29,080
like positive male role models, because I had my brother around, but he's not cool, you

319
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,720
know Ben was cool, but I don't know, I think we were too much alike, oh man I don't even

320
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,880
know what Ben's place in my life was, we hung out a lot, I don't know, I can't even comment

321
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,640
on it, I just gotta skip over that and just say what I'm actually trying to fucking get

322
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:54,880
to, which is that I think anime, cartoons, Goku filled that role model for me, filled

323
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,120
that hole in my life, of like, I didn't have a person in my life like a dad or an uncle

324
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:11,440
who would fucking talk to me about like, oh man, you wanna look at all those sexy girls,

325
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,120
you know, or like, hey let's go hunting, let's go kill things, let's go be beasts, let's

326
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,840
go be animals for a while, you know, I wasn't in touch with my reptilian brain very much

327
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,800
when I was younger, I don't think, I don't think I was really like aware that it's okay

328
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,680
to just be a fucking animal sometimes, you know, and I think I have tried to make up

329
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,400
for that in other ways, but that's why I think I feel so attracted to characters like, like

330
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:48,120
when I was young, Goku man, Goku was my dude, he's why I started exercising all those years

331
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,040
ago and I've been doing it ever since with varying degrees of success, man you should

332
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,680
see some of my pictures at my sexiest, oh it was a fucking god, but give me a couple

333
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,720
months, I'll be back in top shape, I just need to do a little more running, anyway when

334
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,760
I was young, Goku was my hero, it's funny because think about it now, really Vegeta

335
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,560
is the guy that I relate to way more, like fucking Vegeta dude, like prince of all sayings

336
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:26,200
right, fucking planet gets blown up, alright, his kingdom gone, his people gone, like who's

337
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,000
gonna be sadder about a fucking planet being destroyed, like Goku, some fuckboy who doesn't

338
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,920
even know that other fucking Kakaradians exist, other fucking sayings exist, or the fucking

339
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,320
prince of all sayings who was gonna rule over his people and they all fucking died, right,

340
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:52,280
bam, sadder backstory, trains so hard all the time to be the best, and still, fucking power

341
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:00,360
friendship Goku just beats him every god damn time, and of course like being fucking crushed

342
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,480
under the superior alphaness of Frieza his whole life, the guy who killed his dad until

343
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,400
you know fucking Goku saves him, the man who defeated him, god and he can still never surpass

344
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,360
Goku, why is Goku the legendary Super Saiyan, why not me, I'm the fucking prince, I'm just

345
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,240
trying to describe how hard Vegeta worked, right, and how what a raw deal he fucking got his whole

346
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,360
life, until he finally found peace and settled down with a top shelf babe like Bulma, had a

347
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,080
kick ass son like Future Trunks, holy shit, fuck yeah, love Trunks, love Vegeta, love Bulma,

348
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:42,280
perfect family, 10 out of 10, man, but anyway when I was a kid I didn't understand that,

349
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,200
I didn't know what a real nigga Vegeta was, I was into Goku, because Goku's still trained hard,

350
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,120
you know, he worked hard and he played hard, oh god I've gone too far

351
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,120
but Goku was the hero right, Goku was the dude who fucking saved the day, he was the strongest,

352
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,120
he was the coolest, everything revolved around him, he was the most important character,

353
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,480
everyone respected him, everyone loved him, I wanted to be him, I wanted to be him so bad,

354
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,720
I wanted to be him more than anything else in the world, and I think at the time I worked out

355
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,480
specifically to be like Goku, to be a hero is why I worked out, I think that I can say that

356
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,400
with some confidence, that is why I started working out when I was a little kid, I mean I

357
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,720
wasn't that little at that point, I mean I was probably like, I don't even fucking know, long

358
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:47,480
time ago, yeah I wanted to be Goku, and I see that pattern in different ways, as I got older,

359
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,240
you know, like the whole girl thing became more relevant, because when I was young, man, brother,

360
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:03,320
brothers and sisters, I was uncomfortable with the ladies, let me tell you, I had opportunities man,

361
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:11,320
I had him, goofed him up, goofed him up, and that's why I was so attracted to characters like,

362
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:20,760
you know, like Kamina, my favorite character, the women loved him, and the men wanted to be him,

363
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,560
and I was one of them, he had Yoko, he would have had his pick of the litter, you know,

364
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,520
he was a hero, he was a leader, that is the exact kind of person I wanted to be, and

365
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,920
you know, I definitely was not, I definitely was not that guy, for a long time,

366
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:47,000
and I wanted to be more than anything, and you know, I think I'm closer than I've ever been

367
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,680
to being like a Kamina, I mean hey, I fucking, right, my story earlier, inspiring someone to

368
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,640
exercise, work out, and get some real change in their life, that's what it's all about man,

369
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,120
it really, it really touches me that I could, I could do that, I could have that kind of positive

370
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,760
change in somebody's life, so you know what, I mean things are looking up right, things are

371
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:19,560
looking up, I'm just talking about how I relate to that line in fucking Kill Bill, you know,

372
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:27,880
he collected father figures, I collected father figures too, I think, and I, it's guys like

373
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,640
Vash the Stampede, who just go above and beyond the fucking call of duty to protect people,

374
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,000
and their superior, and their gods, you know, like Vash is a fucking god, and he uses his

375
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,800
power to connect with humanity, to have a good life, you know, fucking fuck sluts, like a real guy,

376
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,840
and though he's actually, he's a sensitive soul, he would never take advantage of a woman like that,

377
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,600
because he doesn't want them to see his fucked up body, because he spends all day

378
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:04,200
helping, protecting people, guys like, I mean to some extent, Rance from Sengoku Rance,

379
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,000
and the whole, the whole Rance series, love, love him, big admirer of his work,

380
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,560
go look up Sengoku Rance if you don't know what it is, play that fucking game, it's awesome,

381
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,160
story aside, the gameplay is hard as fuck, love that game, love that game, I don't know, I think

382
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,920
I just wanted to talk about why I'm into anime at all, you know, I'm not like, I'm not like a lot

383
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:36,040
of the other guys on YouTube who talk about anime, who really give a shit about anime as a medium,

384
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:44,760
for me, anime is just sort of the medium that life led me to, that happened to most appeal

385
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,480
to the things I'm into, like, there aren't a lot of communas outside anime, you know what I mean?

386
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,800
You don't see a lot of that shit these days, strong, positive male role models are a big thing

387
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,600
that I like to see, you know, I love good dads, you know, I say that sometimes, I really love

388
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:17,880
good dads, infection, I don't know man, I'm gonna have to listen back to this and see if this is

389
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:27,560
even worthy of being shipped out, this may have gotten too real, too fast, and too furious for you,

390
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,840
and for public consumption, anyway, I think that's about everything I've got to say,

391
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,880
I might delete this, might upload the whole thing, might edit some shit out,

392
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,280
maybe I'll add another piece, I don't know, we'll see, but hey everybody out there, before you go,

393
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:54,520
just remember, go do cool shit that's hard, but you want to do anyway, because if you do it,

394
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,880
because I told you to, and then you tell me about it, I'll feel really good about that,

395
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:09,480
and so go do that, so I can feel good about myself, all right, I demand you make positive

396
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,080
changes in your life, so that I can feel better about myself, all right, there you go, there's

397
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,640
your ultimatum, don't do that or I'll, I don't know, your mother will die under sleep tonight,

398
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:35,560
all right, thanks for listening everybody, I'll see you later.
