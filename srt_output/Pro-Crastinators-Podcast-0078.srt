1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Oh, hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the PCP Crogue Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,520
Oh, I fucked everything up. I don't know. I'm the best guy ever, though, and thanks for joining us.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,840
Here we've got Tom Oliver over here. Yeah, I'm here with my robot body.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Indeed. The Davoo is here. Still just barely able to juggle the scheduling and in monetary conflicts

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,000
caused by having to do PCP responsibilities while hashtag saving the hamsters. They'll have robot

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,680
hamster bodies soon anyway. We've got Hippocrit is here. I identify as being a robot skeleton.

7
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Good. And of course, Digibro. All I want is the Android dong.

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,400
Android dong. Okay, never mind. So, everybody, we're talking about... Oh, I got introduced

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
the show. So, this is The Pro Crastinators Podcast, everybody. It's a podcast of a bunch of internet

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,360
creators. We do YouTube stuff. Some of us do comics, et cetera, et cetera. And here we are

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,760
talking about various topics in this show here on The Procrastinators Channel. And today we're

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,240
talking about transhumanism. Today we're talking about transhumanism. And if you don't know what

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,480
that is, luckily our boys over at Urban Dictionary have you covered. Let's give it a read. Okay,

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,280
that's a long one. I'm going to do the shorter secondary one. Hopefully this will be good.

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,920
Okay. A postmodern theory that posits on the perceived benefit to mankind of having a

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Cuisinart installed in your rectum. Oh, I don't even know what a Cuisinart... Okay,

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,800
then let's talk. Let's do the top definition. Okay, here's one of the little more details.

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,160
This is the top definition. Transhumanism. A movement supporting the use of reason science

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
and technology to advance and enhance human abilities and existence under optimal conditions.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Can be seen as an extension of humanism, but with much more emphasis on the future. Transhumanists

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
believe that we should try to overcome our biological limitations through the use of such

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,920
things as nanotechnology, cryonics, AI, mind uploading, spacetime engineering, Jesus Christ,

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:35,840
eugenics. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. And what not in order to become post-human. I don't understand

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,720
what that last part... I think that was a... The only thing I like about that list was the eugenics.

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
Oh, by the way, I just want to give a shout out to our heroes at Urban Dictionary to which the

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,800
PCPO is the entirety of its success. I just wanted to shout them out as their October 6th

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:02,240
word of the day was boy-splaining. Boy-splaining. It's mansplaining, but immature. That means that

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,800
mansplaining is mature. That means mansplaining is the mature thing to do. You fucked up, Urban

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Dictionary. Isn't boy-splaining literally the entirety of the procrastinator's podcast?

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,120
I agree. That's a good point. So very relevant. So when transhumanism was brought up as a topic,

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,880
I was shocked that we haven't already done this, because I don't know about Hippo, but I know me

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:34,880
and Nate and Tom and probably DeVu are all very big transhumans. We all self-identify as transhumans,

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:43,760
for sure. Well, you know, we're not transhumans, but we're sympathetic to the cause. I don't think

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,880
any of us are augmented yet. You know, to some extent, I've heard people argue that human beings

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,360
as they exist now are semi-transhumans because we have our phones and stuff. Yeah, yeah. Well,

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
the thing I was going to say is I think we've already interrupted evolution, like the evolutionary

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,040
process of human time. Oh, no doubt. No doubt. So we're already off the beaten path. So I just

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,320
figured we might as well go full stop at this point. And I mean, when transhumanism gets brought up,

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,920
I feel like everybody imagines it as like robot parts attached to your body. But a lot of it's

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,880
way more than that. Of course. A lot of it's chemical. And we're all doing that shit. There is

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,600
nobody who is not ingesting some form of chemical that is performance altering in some way as to

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,240
how it's just caffeine. If you've got yourself kind of food, like actually, did you try to establish

43
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,080
smoking weed his new hobby as a transhumanist act? If you've got yourself a fly-ass, bomb-ass,

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,320
dope-ass hoe who you're nutting in regularly and she's taken that pill, that is her being a transhumanist.

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,520
That is her deviating from her biological intentions. So every time you nut in your lady,

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,840
just say, bitch, you're a robot now. That's what I do. That's the fact how I nut. I do. I feel like

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,560
I have to mention that I'm not really that into the future, the sci-fi. I'm more into the past

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
things, like aesthetically. But if transhumanism doesn't mean robot parts and it means all this

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
other stuff, then I don't know. Because I didn't know that. I always assumed it was like looking

50
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,440
way into the future to see all the cool stuff that was like, you know, flying cars attached to your

51
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,680
back. I know you're more into, I don't know. Well, you can be the surrogate for the audience.

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,520
We can dump our knowledge onto you. I think the reason I wanted to specify that, that it's not

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,720
far future, is because it's more interesting to think about the stuff that we can do soon,

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
you know, like the ways that we're already making progress. And a lot of the transhuman stuff I'm

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,720
most excited about is not just robot parts, but like, I don't want to have to sleep anymore.

56
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,480
When are we getting my anti-sleep pill, you know? Or when are we getting... Nate, I was glad you

57
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,440
brought up birth control, because I was thinking about this. I've been thinking about this all

58
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,640
fucking day about what I'm going to bring into this podcast. That I think transhumanism could

59
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,000
easily be mistaken as like a guy thing, because we all, you know, there's stereotype guys love

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
technology and we want to fucking have a robot android dong, you know? But I was thinking about how

61
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,880
there's already pills that can, for instance, make it so you don't have your period anymore,

62
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,840
and like fix PMS stuff. I feel like women would jump right the fuck on that.

63
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,120
It's in fact, it's far more common for, like, the whole idea of female birth control is like

64
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
deeply rooted now in at least western culture, but male birth control is like,

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,000
some movements actually oppose the very idea of it, which I think is sort of a play to like

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,760
keep the sexual power in the hands of women, but we can get into my red pillion over time.

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
Yes, so hippo, like I know you're more into the past, like pirates and shit, but in the future we

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,720
could potentially have pirates, but then also without polio ruining everyone's fun. So I'm

69
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,760
just saying, the future is really better for everyone. I know. I mean, I agree. I agree that

70
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,600
some things are bad about the way humans are and the things that we have to deal with, but I like

71
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,600
wood more than I like metal. That's just really what it comes down to. I like a pirate ship being

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,040
made of wood. I don't want to see pirates with guns get out. That's why apple wood texture

73
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,800
skimmed more quickly on everything. Wait, pirates always had guns. No, no, I mean, like, like,

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,200
modern day pirates are like, oh, the, you know, and I don't know. Like Somali pirates. Somali

75
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,400
pirates, yeah, they go on, they go on dinghies not filled with air and on ships made of metal,

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,800
with guns, get out of here. You know, I don't respect you because of that. If you had wooden

77
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,120
boats, maybe. On the, on the topic of just transhuman in general. Okay. So, so yeah, like,

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm a gigantic fan of this. Like Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite things of all time.

79
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,640
And I want to talk at least at some length and I'm so, it's so cool to me that you brought up

80
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,360
like male versus women just because Motoko is just such a role model to me and just represents all

81
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,480
these great things about like Motoko is like a technological wizard who is like ahead of the

82
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,640
curve. Everyone behind her is like a regressive piece of shit. But Motoko is always thinking about

83
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,120
how to like adapt to the situation she's in. And that, that is inherent to a character as like

84
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,160
the best cyborg user or like one of the best out there. But what I wanted to say about this was

85
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,400
there's so many people when you bring up this topic, like are struck with such a deep level of

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,240
fear instantaneously. And I feel this is one of our like, this is one of our like biological

87
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,840
carryovers from when we were, you know, beasts of the field. It's one of our, it's just like this,

88
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,760
this instinct to be afraid of, of, of change really and of the unknown because like,

89
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,480
whenever I think about this stuff in general, I think about like, okay, we're going to,

90
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,600
we're going to do extensive testing and try to like, okay, if we want to invent like a microchip

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,960
that lets us talk to each other, you know, not, not psychically, but through the technology

92
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,960
implanted our heads, which people are working on actively right now. If you bring up that idea,

93
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,400
people are immediately like, Oh no, I don't want something in my head. Like, oh, imagine all the

94
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,760
things that could go wrong. And like, that's entirely true, which is why we will before like

95
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
making that technology available to extensive testing and try to avoid the very things that

96
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,440
people are afraid of. Well, here's the thing. This is what I think. I think the problem is that

97
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,520
we're all influenced by popular culture and technology is the current boogeyman that we

98
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
all like to think is going to go bad. Like that's been the boogeyman for the last like 20, 30 years.

99
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Yeah, you know, even dumb, you go that and it's like, Oh, Terminator 2, Skynet, all that's just

100
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,960
going to happen. And I just think back to like before that, you know, like, like electricity

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,880
was the boogeyman. It's like, Oh, you got shocked by electricity and turned into a monster because

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,080
we don't understand how this works. So like electricity, no thing like that's gonna be

103
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,160
so much art and like fiction has a hard time like grappling with the fear, but still great

104
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,200
potential of future technology, you know, so much sci-fi stuff, even if part of the appeal of say a

105
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
sci-fi movie is about like showing off this cool technology, the script just cannot help but

106
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,040
constantly preoccupy itself with all the fucking things that can go wrong and scarcely showing you

107
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,280
why people adopted technology in the first place. And again, Ghost in a Shell standalone complex,

108
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,640
the series specifically does a great job. Just really it's not it is even handed. It talks about

109
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,680
cyber brain sclerosis, which is like a disease that no one could figure out caused by a cyber brain.

110
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,320
You're fucked, right? But it's but again, the real villain just in that situation is the fact

111
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
that the corporation invented a cure for it, but didn't want to implement it because it would

112
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,440
impact their bottom line too much. Again, just setting up a situation where technology isn't

113
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,720
what's evil. It's it's the greed of men. That's the real evil here. So like that's exactly what I

114
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
want to see in a story like that, you know, right? Like and like, like actually, I'm actually watching

115
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,960
an episode right now, like earlier today. I also heard an explanation that was like, well, they

116
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,880
couldn't figure out why the cure worked. So it wasn't approved for that reason. I don't. Anyway,

117
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,760
like I even recently watched the Ghost in a Shell movie, you know, the 1995 one, and even that portrays

118
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,800
the whole cyberization thing with a little bit more attention and like fear, because there's like

119
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,440
a scene where Matoko and Bato are sitting on a boat just like reflecting on how like they they

120
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
sure they feel really ambivalent, really mixed about their robot body. So they're like, oh man,

121
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,280
we're like so strong and everything. But like, we can't swim in water without sinking. And I'm

122
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,360
like, dude, what the fuck? Like, I guess I guess it might feel uncomfortable. You might constantly

123
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
feel weird about yourself. But Matoko in the in the series just seems to have not really any

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,720
serious issue. You know, she has trauma over the accident that required the robot body. In general,

125
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,240
it's like, dude, this is fucking awesome. And like, that's the attitude I have for technology. It's

126
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,400
like, oh, the internet. Oh, yeah. You know, early on it caused lots of creepy killers to run around.

127
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
I mean, that's still a thing. It has all those sorts of weird consequences of anonymity, fake news

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,960
and all that shit. But you look at what came before all news was fake news before the internet

129
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,880
because you had no way of knowing what the fuck was going on in the world. They don't know Obama.

130
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,120
So that's why the internet is ultimately the most like incredible for society and same way

131
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,080
cyberization. Yeah, it'll have problems and people who do not fucking respect the difference in

132
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,560
quality of life from before that invention came around will continuously naysay it the same way

133
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,520
that like so much like I think fantasy fiction looks back on like the 1600s and like, oh, no giant

134
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,960
corporations, no fucking worrying about bills. Yeah. And fucking every plague that could kill you

135
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,680
any single week with no soap to help you. No one makes fantasy stories with that shit.

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
I think I think the these things kind of go in cycles as they kind of like permeate popular

137
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,080
culture. I think at first it's like awe and wonder and mystique, then it goes to fear and then it

138
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,320
just becomes acceptance. And like a great example of this, I think is Star Trek. Because I think

139
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
the original series of Star Trek was like, when technology is so crazy, it's amazing. And imagine

140
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,960
all these things we could do with it, we could travel the stars and get solve all the problems we

141
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,520
can heal people instantly. And but by next generation, it's like, oh, now we have the Borg

142
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,760
and like how technology can be used, evilly. And then like Deep Space Nine had a lot of undertones

143
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,080
of like technology being bad too. And I think now it's just kind of like a technology is just

144
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,800
like a backdrop. Like, you know, you look at the Star Trek films and stuff, and there's no statement

145
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,520
on it at all. It's just there. And it's a part of it. And like, I mean, there's plot devices and

146
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,040
stuff. It's interesting. It's interesting, the emphasis that gets played on stories like that,

147
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,560
because like, yeah, like in JJ Abrams' Star Trek, like, there's basically no cycle of philosophical

148
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,560
discussions beyond like the big like, why is the big bad guy doing this? Oh, no, we blew up his

149
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
planet. He's getting vengeance. Like something like that, which is just, you know, bog standard,

150
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,520
like action story shit. Whereas like Ghost in the Shell. So like the 1995 movie that's the most

151
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,440
famous is, I don't know if I want to say this, okay, it is sort of in tone at least my least

152
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,600
favorite interpretation of like the Ghost in the Shell series, entirely because it was by far

153
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,000
the most negative tone like the technology in general. It is a very dour like emphasis. Whereas

154
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,520
what I love about every single other iteration, including a rise to some extent, is that those

155
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,320
ones like like Star Trek, like actually the JJ Abrams Star Trek, they sort of just fully embrace

156
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
the change that they showed. Okay, this is just a world where like cyborgs live among us and it's

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,040
just normal. There's nothing weird about this. And that is honestly, that is fucking progressive.

158
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,080
That is super progressive in a way that I absolutely love that it's just like, yeah, like, okay,

159
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,280
so I don't like, I don't know, I hate all Muslims. I hate all black people. I hate Jews, whatever.

160
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:43,680
But I accept people who have fucking like gigantic like, but that's not of me. That's me

161
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,040
a fictional character. What I'm saying, but it just like, so if you if you hate like races,

162
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,400
but you like like someone with a robotic fucking body or like full of cybernetic, like augmentations,

163
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,640
like on the progressive stale, that's you on the progressive scale, that's you being like

164
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,960
way, way more accepting of someone different from you, you know, so I don't know where I'm going

165
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,560
with that. But yeah, I hate minorities. That's the slogan you're going for is get nanomachines

166
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:25,600
become a Nazi net progressive. I want to say about the the the presentation of technology is

167
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,680
scary. I think a lot of it just comes from like needing drama in a story. Yeah, of like, if we're

168
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,160
going to make a story about sci fi and the whole point is the technology, then the question becomes,

169
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,880
well, how do we create tension? Well, what could go wrong with the technology? And it's kind of

170
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,160
unfortunate. And I also think that people focus so much on the downsides of something like, for

171
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,360
instance, the self driving cars, which are now a thing that's just out there. There's people just

172
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,400
on the road with self driving cars. And of course, the second there was a fatality in one of them,

173
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,880
because of the cars failure, it was like a huge uproar. And it's like, on the one hand, yes,

174
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:10,240
it is still scary that they are not perfect. However, you will probably die in an auto accident

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,680
driving your own car anyways. Like you're talking like near 100% chance. I mean,

176
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,000
did you know that there that that the odds of you getting into an axe in auto accident

177
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,880
is that you will get in one once every 15 years? Well, that is how it's not you have a one in

178
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,080
whatever chance it's you will be involved in an auto accident at least once every 15 years,

179
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,720
no matter how so when you have when you have one accident with self driving cars, it's like,

180
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
what are we pitching about again? You know, it's once it's become so you know, that's that's the

181
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,920
whole thing of people like being afraid people are afraid whenever they put their like their power

182
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
in the hands of something else, even if it is like statistically more reliable. Maybe there's a

183
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,200
yeah, it kind of adds in a degree of people's people's like imaginations can run wild when

184
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,360
they don't actually understand what's happening. So like, there's all this room to conspiratize

185
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,840
about like, Oh, like, let's say like, I don't know, like an Asian guy gets in an accident. It's like,

186
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, my God, the self driving company like car companies are trying to wipe out Asian Americans

187
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,120
and purify the white race in our nation. Holy shit. You said conspiratize that like some sort of

188
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,160
porno about who did 9 11. Like, yeah, it's Alex Jones x Milo Yiannopoulos. It's good shit. Yeah.

189
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,920
I don't yet. People that's just an instinct. There's a major instinct that people have to

190
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,040
be scared of the stuff. And honestly, I am too. I definitely I think it's just a human thing.

191
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,080
And I would really like to transhumanize that away. I would love to cut that part out to say

192
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,360
the solution would be just to somehow augment our brains to get rid of this primitive limitation

193
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
that no longer applies. Man, if only there was some topic we could talk about. It was all about

194
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,280
that. What would you think about like, like that being implemented as like, Oh, a special gas that

195
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,120
makes everyone like technology and never question it. And that you just send that gas out and then

196
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
people are like initially like, Oh, no, I'm being gas. And then they're like, Wait, this was a good

197
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,920
idea. That is a very interesting question. And there is a Futurama issue that deals with that

198
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,480
a Futurama episode. Remember that episode where they get a new robot in the office and Bender

199
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,760
like hates it. So he gets a compatibility upgrade. And what that manifests as is one of the most

200
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,200
interesting episodes. It manifests as Bender like goes to the place to get the upgrade. He then

201
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,240
seemingly chickens out and runs away runs to an island where he like rejects technology becomes

202
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,960
like a wood robot instead of fucking metal. Eventually, like he comes back to land to lead

203
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,240
an uprising. And in the uprising, like he gets hurt and is going to die, except he's saved by the

204
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,600
new robot and is like, I love the new robot now, only to then wake up for the dream that this all

205
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,880
was in the upgrade center. And it was revealed that yeah, like this, this is what the upgrade was

206
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,200
for him, which incidentally is how I think about the way that I became compatible with making fast

207
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
YouTube content. I went through this whole rigmarole just to end up at the very beginning

208
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
where it was like, Yeah, make daily content, make fast content. That's, that's what you gotta do.

209
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,520
Oh, I guess, I guess that's the same thing. Yeah. So I mean, it wasn't an illusion. It was just

210
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,080
real life. That's that's the difference. It doesn't matter. The point is, like,

211
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,840
that is a very interesting thing. And if we could put it in those terms, if we could do things like

212
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,520
that, I like it. I think I have a handful of different because you know, due to you talked

213
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,800
about the whole a need for drama, but it's also need for drama plus lazy creativity, not being

214
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,360
creative enough and coming up with something that can go wrong without undercutting the entire value

215
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,080
of having that innovation in the first place, right? So like, for example, something with like,

216
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,800
like say post scarcity society, where we can simulate anything at any point forever. I had the

217
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,560
idea of like a, we like basically all of humanity gets together to make some computers that will

218
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,560
make more computers, it'll keep making more computers until they make one that is absolutely

219
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,440
intelligent, morally flawless, and will never betray humanity, right? So they make one, and then

220
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
they start expanding and colonizing the galaxy or whatever. So it's like 10s of 1000s of years go by.

221
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,040
And most humans don't even know about this because this post scarcity society is terrifying to most

222
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,520
people. So like, you can learn about it if you if you if you find out about it. And then like,

223
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,640
if you end up really depressed about that, they'll just erase your memories and put you back in some

224
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,680
other simulation, right? So people are put into countless simulations where scarcity is artificialized,

225
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,240
but everyone ultimately is happy. Everyone's given a life where they are given the illusion that they

226
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,120
could fail and end up succeeding, right? Maybe even with lots of stimulated humans, like fake humans

227
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,200
or all who are like dying Africans to make you value your own self, right? And so in the story is

228
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,160
that this AI that's like colonizing a pretty decent chunk of the Milky Way at this point,

229
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,280
finds some other some other fucking force that's like incredibly powerful at some other life form

230
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,480
that's beyond anything that we can conceive. And so the robot needs to figure out like how to beat it

231
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,000
and starts running specific test driven tests on humans to figure out like their behavior and

232
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,840
learn things from them. And maybe there's like one main human character in the story who talks to

233
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,360
the AI directly. You're literally pitching a full sci fi novel right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so

234
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,240
basically the robot has because like maybe the robot can't 100% simulate everything that the human

235
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,800
soul is able to come up with. And there's just things about this abstract entity out in out in

236
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,960
space that he can't understand. So he has to like investigate the human animal and like try to

237
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,840
he spends thousands of years, hundreds of generations evolving certain people to find

238
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,600
an outlier who can represent the same weird trait that this galactic force has. And that's the main

239
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,800
character. Someone would like this trait that no one could ever possibly have without specific

240
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
breeding. And I don't know if that's the fucking beginning of the story. Okay. Kind of sounds like

241
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,360
Neo. He was like kind of born with this awareness of the world. Yeah. My version of Neo, he doesn't

242
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,880
even just see the world in like zeros and ones. He sees the world in zero, one, two and threes.

243
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,400
Like he sees like all the fucking numbers. Whoa. Sorry. Sorry. Go on, Tom. You can go. Oh, that was

244
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,440
me. I was going to say to get to give us some structure here and to get hippo talking as well.

245
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm curious about what transhuman thing each of you wants the most like what what do you want

246
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,880
a realistic one within our lifetime? Yeah, like what if like what do you hope? Let's say they can

247
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
roll it out and then let's say that we are in the technological singularity. So this stuff's

248
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,320
getting rolled out really fast, you know, like what what's the one you want to come next?

249
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,520
Hippo, do you have any like any things you would want to transhumanize like right now?

250
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,480
Well, it's it's always weird for me because I'm not constantly thinking of everything that

251
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,120
I do as a human being being like something I could get rid of or would want to get rid of

252
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,200
because I don't know what it's like to not have it. So I guess something that would just make

253
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,800
my job easier like the ability to write with your mind like you would think words and then

254
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,920
they would just type come up on the page ergonomic keyboard. That would be so perfect for me when

255
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm fucking high because I can't write anything but I have a thousand ideas. Yeah, to make them

256
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,080
come out of your head and also to organize them in a way that's readable afterwards. Yeah, yeah,

257
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,160
that would be pretty great. That's important. I want to I'll go into mine just so I can sort of

258
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,200
lay the like let let you guys know more of what I mean. Though that was a good one.

259
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:22,960
Um, what I want out of transhumanism is basically autopilot. Like because I like setting I love

260
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,400
autopay for instance, like having my bills set to just automatic payments every month, having

261
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,600
everything just work automatically so I don't have to think about it. And I would like it if

262
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,160
something like like my personal upkeep could just be automatic. Like I don't have to worry about

263
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,680
for instance brushing my teeth. I've just got nano bots that do that or my teeth are just not

264
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,600
something that has to be taken care of or like, you know, my hair and beard are just set at a

265
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,560
length and like I don't I don't have to do anything basically. I can just do my job and not worry about

266
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,960
like constantly falling behind on personal upkeep because I'm too distracted by everything else.

267
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,280
That's what I want. Like first, you know, on on that front, you know how that when when you're

268
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,360
in a coma, they actually they sort of exercise your body for you. They stretch your muscles and

269
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,040
they move you so you don't get like bed sores as well as like keep you alive and able to function

270
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,640
once you come back. Like the exercising takes a lot of fucking time and a lot of concentration

271
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,080
and focus to do it right. But yeah, man, I'm totally with you. Like I mean, I know you can

272
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,880
there is a lot to be learned from working out like about self discipline and there's a lot of

273
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,640
good things that come from it. But like when you're in a position like I am where your life's

274
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,880
pretty figured out. And it's not that I lack the discipline per se so much as like I want to do

275
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,840
other things and I it takes up a lot of fucking time and energy, you know, and it doesn't always

276
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,880
leave you in the in a state where you can then perform sitting in a chair for the next eight

277
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:06,000
hours. That's an interesting thing about it's an interesting thing about that because like if

278
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,680
if things are just like easy for everyone to do, you know, the thing like having a perfect physique

279
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,720
or or whatever it stops being special and then everyone can have it and also like the discipline

280
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,840
thing if all these like transhumanist things are like, like, should they be expensive? Should they

281
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,640
be like this some sort of like you have to be a certain age or you have to prove that you're worth

282
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,320
all this stuff? Or is it just giving it to everyone? Like what's the moral thing? I think

283
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
I don't know. It's interesting to to the idea of like we'd all end up the same or it would stop

284
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
being special because that just means that the only people who are going to do it are people who

285
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,080
want it for like real like, I mean, everyone should be healthy because that's just better for

286
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,320
everybody. Yeah, it's not a hard decision, but still most people don't make it. That wasn't really

287
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,480
my point. I was just saying it, but like, like, I don't know. I feel like some people,

288
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,160
they don't, they don't all deserve all the like benefits of technology as like, I don't know. I

289
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,680
feel like there's some sort of a barrier to get into that. I think it'll make people better though,

290
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,280
like like people who, well, another thing I would really want is some kind of, you know,

291
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,760
we need ways to like control our minds better, I think. Like it would be nice if we had a

292
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:35,360
transhumanist way to, I don't know, alleviate insanity. Like I just feel like there is a risk

293
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,880
if like everybody becomes the same person or something. But like I feel like as we approach,

294
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
it would just be a change in like what we value. Like I mean, there was once a time where everybody

295
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,960
was healthy, you know, like because you had to be or else you fucking died. So like, well, okay,

296
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,640
maybe not, maybe help me like, yeah, I fit. Yeah. There was a time where there wasn't

297
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,760
fat slobs everywhere, you know, right? True. True. And it didn't, it didn't mean that

298
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,440
everybody has to do the same thing. It just means you can change your focus elsewhere. Like a guy

299
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,600
who, like there's some people who are way into fitness and that's their whole identity. But if

300
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,440
fitness was just something taken care of, they would probably just do something else. You know,

301
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,360
like that just wouldn't, it just wouldn't be something that is somebody's identity. But

302
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,520
something else might be, something that we didn't know we had time for. My answer to your whole

303
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,400
question about, about what you would, what you would do, what I would do, what I would want the

304
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,960
most out of like a quick rollout of transhumanism would be another way to do the same thing,

305
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,360
essentially, which is also an expansion of what Hippo said, which is just having a computer

306
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,800
screen I can see and control mentally, then I would never, I could just go for a walk all day

307
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,480
and get all my work done. That would be the tits. I love that idea. But for me,

308
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,400
like in all sci-fi stories, that is the thing I least can believe is like controlling things with

309
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,280
your mind, because your mind doesn't work that straightforwardly. You know, like at least my

310
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:05,120
thoughts, they don't occur in like a narrative way. It's not like, it's not impossible to control,

311
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,080
because like I've seen disabled people with like robotic arms that are controlled with like wires

312
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,680
into their brain. I feel like if we have the ability to control our, like our bodies to the

313
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,960
level of precision that we do, like just if you move all your fingers at once, like I'm doing

314
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,160
right now, like that's a lot of precise control that I have. I feel like it is possible. It might

315
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,320
actually take a lot of effort to do like as a person. I'm just wondering like if, let's say I'm

316
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,800
typing with my mind, is it going to only type the things that I want to be typed or is it going to

317
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,160
type every fucking word that's in my head of which there are thousands? The assumption is that you'll

318
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,640
get a little extra, a little chip, a little tiny bit of a little brain matter that will take care

319
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,240
of all that. Just like, yeah, just the same computer codes can now be thought. The way I would assume

320
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,880
it would work or that I imagine is that you're not like thinking a word like in your head the way

321
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,640
you would think a word now. You're imagining or controlling a pretend arm typing on a pretend

322
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,800
keyboard. Right, because when you're typing, you're still thinking of the end words you want to type.

323
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,520
So this is just taking those motor actions and translating them into the head screen itself.

324
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,880
You're using that same thought process like, okay, now I'm going to type this sentence after I've

325
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,440
thought about what it's going to be and instead of changing that into a physical motor action,

326
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,360
you're just directly putting it onto whatever this display is. But hey, ultimately we are talking

327
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,960
about fiction. I'm prepared to say like, yeah, we could figure that out. That seems fair to

328
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,800
you. Did you want to add anything else or can I go? No, that was it. Okay. Mine is a little bit

329
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:50,560
further out and possibly not even real or could be done. But what I want the most is I want the

330
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,720
ability to detach consciousness from the physical body. And that could mean either to like physically

331
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:05,440
body swapping so that I can be a big slut and fuck dudes. That'd be cool. Or like the ability to

332
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,240
sort of, and this is like next level shit, but like uploading your consciousness to the cloud,

333
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,600
to the internet. I don't know what that's like. If you could have an android body, if we could swap

334
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,800
our brain into someone else's body, would anyone in here remain male? Because I know I would not.

335
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,920
Well, not all the time, certainly not. Long term, I would want to remain male. I mean, I do like

336
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,640
being a guy. I would reevaluate what it even means to be male in a world with that where

337
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
that is the case. So would everyone. But I'm pretty happy being male right now. I would probably be

338
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,040
both. I don't see any reason why not to be both. Like at the same time, I mean, the body would just

339
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:46,560
both. Everyone in the future will just have a dick and tits and it'll be great. I wonder if after

340
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,440
you do the other one, if you'll be like, actually, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Like once you've

341
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,920
been it, will it just change your perception of it entirely? I'm sure it's gonna end sexism. It's

342
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,640
great. I'm sure it'll have an effect. You know, though, what this does make me think of a lot

343
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,520
is the I give brought this up a little bit. Like if this stuff gets implemented to some degree,

344
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,360
imagine the incredible gap that will develop between people who have this shit and people who don't.

345
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,760
I think that's probably the most terrifying part. And there are times when I'm always wondering,

346
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,080
like, do the super elite already have transhumanist benefits that we just don't?

347
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,040
Maybe, man. Maybe. See, I'm not afraid of that because I'll be in the transhuman camp and I'll

348
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,320
have a rocket launcher in my arm. And so if all the if all the proletariat are like, we're gonna

349
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,160
overthrow you because you fucking pieces of shit, I'll just be like, and kill all the more people.

350
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,920
Yeah. Classes and boys.

351
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,760
I think in order to be in that camp, you need more than 350,000 subscribers. I think the wealth

352
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,240
gap is a little bit bigger than that. Pewdiepie is gonna be the only robot YouTuber. He's gonna

353
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:07,040
go around assassinating the media. Yeah, and the media. He's gonna upload a video where he gets

354
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,760
some people in like a third world country uploading death to all flesh bags and he's gonna

355
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,040
gasp like, how could they say that? Indeed. I look forward to the racial slurs that develop

356
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,040
for transhumanists. It's gonna be fun. We're really talking about the boringest parts of

357
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,760
future novels. Like, oh, the despair. Oh, the weird weird words we come up with. Yeah, okay,

358
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,800
skip this chapter. Well, yeah, but like the whole like poor thing, like I assume if we have like

359
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,480
all this super technology, we'd get to a point like where there's no reason we couldn't give it to

360
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,520
everyone, but then my problem would be if we're still operating under that kind of model. Yeah.

361
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
If capitalism is still real, like why would we give it to them? And it's possible that like

362
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,600
nothing that someone who doesn't have these abilities could ever do could like get them to a

363
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,480
place where they can like afford to do this. I'm just wondering at that point, if we get to the

364
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,560
point where you can literally, you know, have a cybernetic body, we get technology to that

365
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,160
degree, like would we even have problems with like means of production at that point? Like I

366
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,960
can't even see capitalism. Those are separate issues. This is addressed in an interesting way

367
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,080
in a show that the first half of which is amazing. The second half is a dumpster fire called Cado

368
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,440
where an alien life form shows up on earth and he's trying to advance humanity as fast as

369
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
possible, basically. And so he comes bearing gifts and the first gift he gives them is these

370
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,680
little orbs that have infinite energy. And he's like, he's like, I want everyone in the world to

371
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:44,320
have this, but like the government and what's it called the United Nations are like, we want to

372
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,000
have control over it and have sanctions. So basically he teaches people how to just make them, like

373
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,440
how to make these balls, so everyone can have it. And he was like, what these people don't

374
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,160
the government's not understanding is they're worried about like this being an arms race or

375
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,560
a power struggle. But the fact is, if everyone has it, there's no need to fight over it. Like

376
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,760
everyone can have this. That's true and all, but it is possible. Like if everyone had nukes

377
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,080
right now, it's possible like North Korea, if they had overwhelming power would just destroy

378
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:20,240
everyone else. So that is a real concern to have. So I'm with the UN right now, but okay, go on.

379
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,120
No, that was it. That's all I had to say.

380
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,680
That show goes right. It doesn't, it does not continue to explore this amazingly interesting

381
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,000
situation it's created. It turns into a terrible action show.

382
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,880
Talking about that in regards to say like scarcity, right? For example, we're entering

383
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,720
a situation where more and more shit is automated and people are concerned about humans having jobs.

384
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,040
The thing is, every time a robot replaces a job, it makes living on the earth a little bit cheaper.

385
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,440
Like imagine we just have robots for like everything, we have robots that construct a house

386
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,200
and like refurbish it. And also the robots deliver the pieces of that house to the building site.

387
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,840
And also robots mind and cut down the resources from planet Earth to make those parts. So if

388
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,760
everything is done through robots, let's say even the administration of the business is done through

389
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,120
robots, then the only thing you're having to pay for is the energy spent operating the robots,

390
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,840
which the robots could themselves be mining for making even the obtainment of energy resources

391
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,760
really cheap. Meaning in a society where everything's done by robots, basically,

392
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,280
there's not necessarily much need for money if we just skip straight to the far future. But the

393
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,000
problem is that moving into that progress is sort of blocked or clogged up by like laws and social

394
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,400
standards that are in place to keep people from getting jipped out of work or finances. Stuff like

395
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,720
the minimum wage, like for all it does to help people not get fucked over, it also kind of

396
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:56,560
fucks over progress in a lot of ways. And yeah, you know, you're not wrong. It's a complex thing.

397
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,960
Yeah, transition to that. Everything about the way our system, at least in America right now,

398
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,480
is adapted for the current situation we found ourselves in. Well, I guess you got to actually

399
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,160
argue it's adapted for one like 50 years ago that we're still trying to catch up to right now with.

400
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,960
But probably even before that. But nonetheless, like you're entirely right. This getting to these

401
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,280
positions is going to be a very difficult struggle in a very, you know, transition period where people

402
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,120
are displaced. That's right. That's right. What if what if what if Rick and Morty was real?

403
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,360
Hey, Rick's got a robot body sometimes. That's pretty cool. It's pretty cool.

404
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,720
That'd be cool. Tom, you haven't answered this yet, have you?

405
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
I have not answered it yet. Right, right. I mean, I guess mine's just really fucking petty

406
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,920
compared to everybody else's. The one thing I'd want is to just like, I've always been disgusted

407
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,520
and ashamed in the fact that our flesh and blood bodies are so fragile. Like it's just like, oh,

408
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,920
like you have like, one heart and if it something happens to it, you're fucked, like we can kind

409
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,760
of hopefully stitch something in there, but you got to wait around and it's not a good chance,

410
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,720
like, like it just blows my mind that we can't just swap it out. So if we're going to do transhumanism,

411
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,720
what I think the first thing that should happen is either nanomachines that can

412
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,480
enhance and repair organs so bodies don't die and don't break down literally metal gear rising

413
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,480
nanomachines. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. I mean, it just that just seems like

414
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,360
the most logical thing because like, I long term, I would like to have a fully synthetic body,

415
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,960
not necessarily like something out of like Deus Ex Human Revolution where they just literally

416
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,080
attach metal arms onto me after sawing off my normal ones because like Deus Ex is a great example

417
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,600
of like why that doesn't really work because like in the world of Deus Ex, in the original game,

418
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,680
they have nanomachines, like that's the current technology. So like the main character,

419
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,800
JC Denton, he walks around, he looks pretty much like a regular guy, but his entire body is augmented

420
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,720
with nanotechnology. The whole point of Deus Ex 1 is that it's like, oh man, you've seen

421
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,480
robot guys, but this is a guy who's robot just as small, he looks like a normal guy,

422
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,320
but then you're telling me the later Deus Ex games from the following century regressed on that

423
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,000
idea? Come on, it's twenty fifteen people. The other games are prequels to the first one.

424
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,040
Yeah, they take place, I think, twenty years beforehand. So maybe a prequel to a futuristic

425
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,840
story is a dumb idea. I thought it was actually really interesting. I think it worked very well

426
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,840
because like the idea in like the original Deus Ex is obviously it's talking about augmentation

427
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,360
and stuff in general, but it also has this interesting idea of like we have all these clunky

428
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,120
big robot dudes walking around that like at the time that was like the shit and what you were

429
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,600
supposed to do, but now like you can't, they can't get the nanomachines in the way that normal people

430
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,200
being born now can because they already hacked off the regular limbs. So there's this dichotomy

431
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,600
of like now they're second-class citizens where before they weren't because they can never take

432
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,240
advantage of this new technology the way that people now can. And then in Deus Ex Human Revolution

433
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,160
it's talking about the impact on current society of having augmentations becoming something in

434
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,160
the beginning. You could already see in those games the foreshadowing of like the nanomachines

435
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,320
technology coming because obviously the series has that in its lore already. So it's two different

436
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:25,040
kind of conflicts, but that's like I just it just seems to me the Deus Ex original game that's kind

437
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,600
of like the robot body I'd want or like the cyber brain robot body out of Ghost in the Shell. That

438
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,600
just makes more sense because I think it's just it's more advanced in general like I wouldn't

439
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,800
want to have this big giant fucking hulking arm because like the main character in Deus Ex Human

440
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Revolution his tech looks really like slick and nice and shit, but that's because like it's the

441
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,760
most expensive fucking crazy shit they goodbye. Normal people walking around that you talk to

442
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,440
look like fucking Gundams and not in a good way. That sounds kind of dope, but you know once we get

443
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,560
once we get really deep into this shit like like remember in Ghost in the Shell how there was like

444
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,240
the president of one of the companies is just like a dude in a fucking box with like tiny little

445
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,360
like that's like the coolest thing ever. Dude I wanted to talk about this because you said like

446
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,120
eventually you want to disconnect consciousness from physical bodies and this is something I

447
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,880
think about a lot because I love transhumanism as a concept, but the thing that I always wonder

448
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,240
is like what's the end game? We're going to keep pushing this forward and forward and forward

449
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,680
and the end game seems to inevitably be to abandon physical reality entirely in my opinion. I think

450
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,800
that sort of or make the form that you that you sort of host in like it could be anything.

451
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,040
My my my thing is like what if you just existed digitally like what if you just there was no

452
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,040
like the physical because like no matter how much we like augment ourselves with like human

453
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,760
like like humanoid cybernetic bodies or whatever even just like non-human cybernetic bodies we're

454
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,920
still limited by being physical of having mass of taking up space and so like if you lived completely

455
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,640
digitally like think about it this way when you're on the internet and you go to a website you don't

456
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,800
have to travel from google physically to the next website you just go there what if like that's how

457
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,080
travel in general works like if you were just digital like first of all there'd be no need for

458
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,000
construction because everything could be made instantaneously because it's digital so there's

459
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
no worrying about resources resources are finite or infinite not finite anymore you're not dealing

460
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,840
with finite resources like oh someone needs a house just drop in the house.exe and it just builds it

461
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,360
so like there's nothing to deal with that. The thing with all that and this is this is like the

462
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,240
line I draw because digital enhancing your body so that you can do things in the you know in the

463
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,080
real world way better you know getting rid of the the need to sleep and all that sort of stuff

464
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:51,280
that's fine but when you start talking about living entirely as digital beings I'm like well a digital

465
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,960
being doesn't need a house he doesn't need anything he may as well have just killed himself.

466
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,480
Well no no that might my point is that when we get to this point of being a physical of being of

467
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,560
abandoning physical reality entirely if we get to that point well you have to actually wonder like

468
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,560
can our brains even cope with that because if you're not a physical being anymore and let's

469
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,280
why would you get in your car and drive to work why would you even have a concept of like buildings

470
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,560
and roads you would just you would just be like energy basically a consciousness that exists

471
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,280
and like could the human brain which has kind of obviously evolved to deal with the limitations

472
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,360
of physical reality adapt itself to a reality where I can't comprehend it of being just like

473
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,440
thoughts and math or like thoughts and consciousness that kind of just can

474
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,720
sift and move around somehow and interact with other things like I don't even know how to work

475
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,280
it's beyond clearing my comprehension. That's why I'm gonna actually lay down an actual like solid

476
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,280
like a die in the wall or lie in the sand prediction right you see people in the past be

477
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,520
like oh yes eventually computers may only be the size of two refrigerators by the year 2000 you

478
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,760
know but in some people who hit it right on the fucking money you know like oh man this whole

479
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,160
internet thing I think it's gonna bring us all together and it also isolate us and create weird

480
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,240
anonymous people right some people are out on the money so I'm gonna I'm gonna take my chance right

481
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,280
my prediction as I sort of alluded to but earlier is that when we inter-post scarcity be it because

482
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,760
we all become digital concepts or because we have 3d printers and intergalactic travel and

483
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,160
and we have like nanomachines that protect our bodies forever one way or another once we enter

484
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,200
actual true post scarcity it's only a matter of watching those rpgs rts stat bars on the galaxy

485
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,360
go up waiting for that resources to be mined from our solar system and other stars when we get to

486
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:44,000
that point my prediction is that people will have a mass exodus from actual awareness of lucidity

487
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,200
right of everyone will just go into simulations right be it actually constructing a simulation

488
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,720
and like living in it or just building a program you know like like 1950s american housewife.exe

489
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,440
boom you now think that's you your memories are totally altered and like once that simulation

490
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,520
of you version dies and you become conscious again you're like oh okay so now i'm gonna do this or

491
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,760
that we just come up with all sorts of weird fucking lives for us to have and you know and

492
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,240
we just exist like that forever and ever and ever and that's basically it I think that basically

493
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,320
works my my just feel like what's the point like why would why would any of that ever exist for

494
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:24,080
anyone my concern is that like if you upload yourself to the cloud then there is there just is no

495
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,600
more you you are just part of the cloud it's just well the cloud is just everybody it's just a

496
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,360
collective conscious because like you have all the information there is you know like if you

497
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,440
are a part of the information then like basically you know what everyone else is thinking because

498
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,360
it's all in the cloud you know like you've basically you're just a part of the the overall

499
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,360
partitions if you want there to be it's not you have to I mean they would they would have to be

500
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,480
heavy partitions for it to mean anything to a human going into the divisions between individuality

501
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,000
wouldn't be the access to information would be the interpretation of it because that's how

502
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
information works right now you can give two people the same information they can extrapolate

503
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,640
completely different results well okay you know i talked about like computer brains right so human

504
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,000
brains right now is a computer that is always running right is all even in a coma it's always

505
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,800
constantly going through its program loop right and whereas you know a hard drive or a program on

506
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,120
a floppy disk or whatever can just be inert right all the data is there but it's not moving so you

507
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,680
could program something on a floppy disk to be like oh man when i'm running i want to eat food

508
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,760
food.exe where the fuck can i get my food right but if it's just the floppy disk not being run

509
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,280
it's inert data not moving it's not alive right so presumably if you want an accurate if we're if

510
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,040
we're already assuming that we're having accurate representations of the human brain one prerequisite

511
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,280
is that we're already running right we're not just data on a floppy disk because then we're dead until

512
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,840
someone boots us back up right so if we are running then presumably if it's an accurate

513
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:58,480
representation of the human mind there is going to be a hey i need uh more of my fucking food value

514
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,520
can i please get my food variable please can i please get my human comfort variable i need it

515
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,920
right so for me it's i don't know i feel like that's kind of like a really obtuse

516
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,200
his hair here's my ex let me give you my expectation of uh my final form of transhumanism

517
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,920
that i imagine and even longer beard that the despair the disparity will be pretty massive

518
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,920
because even right now like think about the information disparity between someone who like

519
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,920
not only has a smartphone but uses it all day to use the internet to access all the worldly

520
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,480
information and like someone in like a tribal society in africa or something like the information

521
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
disparity is unbelievably i just imagine people in that tribe yeah well i imagine that people in

522
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,520
some tribes out in the world like literally have no concept of what the world is at this point

523
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,680
you know like there's no way to bridge the information gap that's at that scale so i'm

524
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,360
imagining that yes there will be a way to have a partitioned mind in a machine the people with

525
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:15,440
the partition minds they're going to be the uh Babylon like it's just people fucking around

526
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,120
like like people just my mind's in a computer and i can do anything now you know like my life's

527
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,600
going to be nothing but fucking sluts all day like that's that's the partitioned minds

528
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,880
then you have the people who join the collective cloud conscience who all mind meld into one being

529
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,800
and they're the ones who within like a year solve how to get off the planet and they fuck off

530
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,520
and they're like look humans y'all got a choice you can either mind meld with us and get the

531
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,640
fuck off this planet or you guys can hang out here until the planet explodes and we're all like

532
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,800
you know what giving up my individuality scares me too much so i'm not joining the

533
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,200
cloud i guess i mean i don't digi it's very it's very interesting digi that you refer that you

534
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,160
use the word babel on there because i think that is a very accurate word to use uh because you know

535
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,000
tower of babel on and all that and what this this whole discussion what we're what we're kind of

536
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,680
with our ape like understanding in our in our our you know crude human matter brushing up against

537
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,720
at the top of this is like where does what what lies above the consciousness that we now have what

538
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,760
happens when we all meld ourselves into a greater collective that has all the processing power of

539
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,680
the entire species and i like i that is entirely what the end of the you know of course the most

540
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,400
famous most successful ghost in the shell movie is all about because that's exactly what happens

541
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,880
with the puppeteer the puppeteer you know access if find some way to access like to basically upload

542
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,640
him herself itself whatever to like this network and motoko briefly briefly experiences what that

543
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,800
would be like and in both the manga and the anime in the movie rather like she basically sees the

544
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,320
face of god for a second it's it's it's portrayed in this angelic way and i think that is a fascinating

545
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,680
way to interpret it because i don't care about religion at all i think it's bullshit and god

546
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,440
doesn't exist but i'm happy to accept that what people think religion is and think god is could

547
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,640
just be some higher level understanding that maybe maybe in history sometimes people have tapped

548
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,880
into for brief moments it's it's possible in some weird way that i don't understand i mean the

549
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,760
point of it is i don't think to vote the point of it is there is a higher level of consciousness

550
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,800
than what we have it might not be anything like what we think existence or consciousness is right

551
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,520
now but there is something above it maybe it's even just so much consciousness and processing

552
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,960
power in a place that it makes like our like like her basically exactly like her where everything we

553
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,320
experience now is like incredibly slow motion and incredibly basic compared to what that that thing

554
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,640
can process and to become a part of that is to completely lose what you were before and to

555
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,360
become something just godlike yeah you know like okay so the whole thing about like the collective

556
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,920
right i'm gonna like really like like shit on the idea of a collective i guess ironically

557
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,160
according to the memes but like uh fucking what i understand about computer hardware i don't know

558
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,720
of anything i don't know like i guess there might be some big old fucking matrix somewhere in some

559
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,600
facility that people have been constructing i guess but like the the actual internet is not

560
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,960
like that at all the actual internet is just a bunch of different servers with a bunch of

561
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,360
different fucking wires you know there was one time not too long ago where some fishermen just

562
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:22,480
dropped a big fuck off anchor uh down to the ocean i happened to snap a particular uh ocean line

563
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,880
and like some random south american nation was without internet for like a couple of days because

564
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,160
they had to fix that right there is no like central place where everything is everything is like

565
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,680
like uh f to p or whatever no no it's like it's like torrents right it's just one thing

566
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,160
pure yeah peer to peer yeah one thing go into another thing go into another thing right you're

567
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,000
entirely right you're entirely right it's like what exactly would be this collective i'm not saying

568
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,160
you couldn't very easily construct okay here's just like a basic version the basic version of what

569
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,320
i'm sort of describing here is like okay what if you could just access the internet from your brain

570
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,120
at any time like that's like the first step it would be like okay now i just like know everything

571
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,880
now i just i know everything so this is this is different now i i am a different person than

572
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,400
what it was before i knew everything and that's just like the first time what if you could then

573
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,520
communicate with everyone in real time instantly in addition to knowing everything okay it's

574
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,160
essentially oh that's what you mean different essentially you already know everything on the

575
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,880
internet if you count flipping out your phone and then reading it into your eyes as knowing it

576
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,440
because essentially your phone with its access to the internet is essentially a memory bank that

577
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,640
just takes longer to up to to to get into your server than uh than just having it in your brain

578
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,640
directly would be yeah that's kind of an interesting thing how like the definition of of memory works

579
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,600
like that like uh i was actually thinking recently like if someone did like a like a memory swap thing

580
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,240
where suddenly you have like let's say a memory edition right let's say you like invade someone's

581
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,240
brain and you have all their memories and now you have control of them right i'm like would you

582
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,440
just suddenly you wouldn't have like the sudden moment where you suddenly remember everything

583
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,000
about their lives it's rather let's say you get up in their room right you look at your kitchen

584
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,400
you're like oh hey i suddenly know where everything is you remember each thing as you need it so

585
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,040
essentially being part of this that's how memory works yeah you just you just be able to know what

586
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,440
when you need to know it so you could very well still have a pretty big disparity of intelligence

587
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,160
regarding like how well you can like actually interpret all of that information so yeah okay

588
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,680
that makes a fucking interesting thought um i always imagine the cloud is like a beowulf cluster

589
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:32,320
of brains like at the end of psychopaths oh yeah like sorry i well i don't know it's usually just

590
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,920
down to the question of are you willing to just go into this unknown thing because nobody can

591
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,520
nobody in an ai digital form will be able to accurately explain to you exactly what it feels

592
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:50,480
like in the lifespan of a human they just can't do it so you have to just take a you know jump in

593
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,600
or just really interesting hippo because the stuff you're the way you're describing it is exactly what

594
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,960
the first episode of serial experiments lane is about which is where a character kills herself

595
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,400
so that she can be only exist in the cloud and she's basically like mass emailing people telling

596
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,600
them like you should come here because it's it's the most liberating feeling like it changes

597
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,760
what you are and basically lane ends up following her into the cloud based on sheer curiosity about

598
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,920
like what is it like to have that you know that's true i mean you know personally i i when it comes

599
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:34,800
to that question i am not convinced that it would be better i'd be terrified if my life if my life

600
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,320
was terrible and i was gonna kill myself anyway i would do it by jumping into a digital big old

601
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,680
computer thing right sure yeah that's like actually i'd like to like bring the whole discussion

602
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,400
over to that idea if we could is like let's think realistically like forgetting your ideology and

603
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,280
actually incorporating what level of fear or you know inertia you have inhibitions you have an

604
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,880
adopting potentially dangerous untested technology or not completely tested on the actual public you

605
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,520
know we live in a fucking note seven society here technology that you know could end up having

606
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,160
unforeseen consequences like what would you actually do as a preventative measure or like

607
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,520
how quickly would you adopt it based on the information i'll i'll tell you for me like

608
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,200
i even right now even though i made the case for why it's safe earlier i still would be

609
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,600
uncomfortable driving a self-driving car indeed the only way i'd be comfortable enough is if

610
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,040
most people were doing it basically i'm a fucking sheep is what i'm saying like i will probably never

611
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,960
be an early adopter no i'm not because i want it to be i want it to already be perfect by

612
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,040
the time i get there and agree it's a different thing to be an early adopter when like okay there's

613
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,840
a new phone out okay i'm gonna rush in be the early adopter as opposed to like my fucking car uh you

614
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:51,680
know that's like it's a different level of state partly partly it's because i will i won't learn

615
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,400
everything about it i want someone else to be i want it to be something that like because let's

616
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,000
say you you fuck up your smart car how many people can fix it you know like how many people

617
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,160
understand what's wrong with it do you know what's wrong with it you know even people who know cars

618
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,200
won't know what's wrong with it you'll have to go to tesla the google corporation you know if it's

619
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,120
if it was everywhere if it's gotta imagine the google algorithm oh tom you took the fucking algorithm

620
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:26,240
right out of my mouth yeah like and even with smartphones you know i didn't come in until

621
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,720
the fucking note three was like my first smartphone like i because it wasn't prolific enough that i

622
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,240
immediately understood it and it was only once everyone had one and i got what you could do

623
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,320
it was basically the day i saw somebody playing super mario 64 on a phone that i went okay this

624
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,200
technology has come too far for me to ignore it anymore you know right on the bell curve you're

625
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,920
like you're the you're the late majority slash laggard when it comes to things in general i would

626
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,920
say um i would say early majority of depending on what the technology is and what i think my

627
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,360
use for it will be like for instance if we start having optic implants you know my eyes i'm afraid

628
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,320
about my eyes like sometimes my eyes hurt for no reason and i feel like it would might be better if

629
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:18,160
i had specialized you know like if that technology if the technology gets rolled out where like some

630
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,000
people have augmented eyes and then now there's an entire new field of film that you can only watch

631
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,920
if you have specialized and and my favorite animators are working in that field like that's

632
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,000
where i'm going to start getting convinced you know you got to draw me in you got to make me

633
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,600
think that my life's going to be better than it is and i'm fairly happy with my life so like i don't

634
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,560
need i'm i'm definitely someone i'm someone who's more like willing to take a chance if like if

635
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,240
it intrigues me i'd probably do it i think the problem for me would be cost because i have no

636
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,520
fucking money but uh in terms of willingness yes the the interesting thing is like is there a line

637
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,560
this is a question i wanted to bring up to people because it definitely is for me is there

638
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,600
a line that you won't cross is there some if they is there some sort of transhumanism that you

639
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,480
feel like no i'm not going that far what is my life right now because if like hippo said if i'm

640
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,440
depressed and everything's going wrong fuck it throw me in the cloud like if my life is miserable

641
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,680
especially like let's say i became like a vegetable or something oh yeah do do anything to me like

642
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,640
fucking get me out of here like i don't need to be in this body anymore but like if i'm as i am now

643
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,800
where my individuality means a lot to me it's difficult for me to imagine just giving that up

644
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,000
for you know for the documented thing that people don't change that much once they're past a certain

645
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,120
age so even if right now i began to see like the entire population of the earth adapt to let's just

646
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:45,600
say i augmentations everyone's getting robot eyes to then to sell myself on the idea of going into

647
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,520
the doctor having him literally cut the eyeballs out of my fucking skull to replace them with something

648
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,920
else i'm just saying it would be a hard sell because i don't know anyone who's had their eyeballs

649
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,200
cut out of their fucking skull i've never seen it done like like it's gotta be because it's gonna be

650
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,680
an incredibly expensive procedure and if it's not expensive i don't want it because they're gonna

651
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,000
fuck it up like i want the best scientists in the fucking world uh augmenting my eyes you know

652
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,720
it better not be some fucking quack doctor yeah for me unless the technology is that easy yeah man

653
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,120
when you imagine imagine when this technology is finally out all the fucking my vision is augmented

654
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:27,040
memes that would resurface dude like so for me there'll be a whole new class of of memes you

655
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,680
could only understand with those eyes oh just like just like fucking uh what's that what's that movie

656
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,240
with the obey and shit they live it'd be a whole thing live meme scape there'd be reddit posted

657
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,680
everywhere it's about weighing the different levels of risk and weighing the different

658
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,200
levels of value so like you know if uh if they got nanomachines that make you swear hey if you

659
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,320
fall a 50 foot gap you come off with a scratch or get hit by a car you might have a broken bone

660
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,480
right and it's like oh there's there's like 10 reports of someone randomly dying from those

661
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,320
nanomachines every year i'm gonna go for that you know because life is dangerous never knowing

662
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,720
you could fucking fall on die right so i think i'd go for that assuming it's not too expensive

663
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,960
if there's something that's like a little a little dude you know that if if nanomachines came into

664
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,120
existence and like the death rate in the world dropped from like 100 million to like 10 people

665
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,040
be like oh fuck those nanomachines man they're killing people out there they're fucking killing

666
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,880
people that's humans for you that's humans for you yeah i mean the thing the thing that the line

667
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,800
that i wouldn't cross for me personally and maybe as if time goes on and technology gets more advanced

668
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,960
that our understanding improves i could be swayed on this because i'm i'm willing to say that could

669
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,400
be swayed on anything really if you present a good enough argument i know what you're gonna say

670
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:46,160
jewe technology i hear you know i cannot i cannot cross that you got me no um i is i would be more

671
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,720
than willing to have my my body augmented as long as i knew it was safe i would have the

672
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,920
willing to have my brain augmented if i knew it was safe the one thing i just don't i don't think

673
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,320
i would ever feel comfortable doing unless you gave me a really solid argument would be would be um

674
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:08,560
to have like my my consciousness copied onto a computer because i think i think that your you're

675
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,360
still alive in your brain so like you can enhance that as much as you want but as soon as you like

676
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:19,520
kill my brain like i'm dead a copy of me is existing so are you saying are you uncomfortable

677
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,680
with the idea of just like there's you and then they make a copy and then there's two of you or

678
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,960
this like you're transposed from here to there i'm saying being transposed is still right because

679
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,520
you will be dead you will die yeah there will be no transposition it's a copy paste and deleting

680
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,200
the original file the the only way i've been i've been thinking about this before the only way that

681
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,520
i'm at all like comfortable with that is that what's that ship the ship of thesius or whatever

682
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:47,200
like that model if we can if we can like plug in my brain to the computer and slowly piece by

683
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,840
piece we move little bits of me over so that after a while i'm like halfway on halfway off

684
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,720
and then we keep doing that until now i'm all the way on the computer even then it's kind of like

685
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,600
a hazy maybe you're still dead i think you're still dead right well the problem i don't have an

686
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,720
answer i mean i think that doesn't really come into the thing like it's you know if you're you're

687
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,680
just slowly being copied that's all this whole this whole discussion it's the same as teleportation

688
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,600
like like you're killing yourself and but you know you as you understand may i remind me it's

689
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,840
gonna be around when it comes to the teleportation argument i always have to remind everyone

690
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,960
that every seven years there is no same atom in your body that was there seven years ago

691
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,520
yeah you are literally a wholly different person every seven years it's the it's the it's the

692
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,160
continuity that people value that's what's mad and that's that's why i think the ship of damocles the

693
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,600
ship of thesius whatever it is that models whatever it is that sort of makes sense that to do it that

694
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,320
way as long as there's continuity you're conscious the entire time you're slowly transposed for one

695
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,120
body to another i mean it makes no sense i'm more i'm more willing to entertain that than a

696
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,320
than a snap cons copy yeah yeah guys yeah that whole discussion is based on a really stupid axiom

697
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,160
that oh you have to delete the original that's absolutely not a thing at all there's no reason

698
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,600
why you couldn't just copy it some people it's it's a whole separate issue though like yeah like

699
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,960
am i comfortable with there just being another me i would have to think about and that's that's

700
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,960
like a separate question i think it would be really funny just like just like in a homestuck with

701
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,840
little how the debu collective would be comfortable with oh yeah you wouldn't you fucking motherfucker

702
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,200
that happens in serial experiments lane and the alternate version ruins her life so you know it

703
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,240
can be scary well that goes back to the horrors of technology i would i here's what i would do i would

704
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:42,240
make a copy of myself in a robot body so that i could beat it up if it you know so that it's it's

705
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:47,360
for convents for self-esteem like fuck you dude i'm the no no what i mean is if it tries to

706
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:52,160
fuck up my life it still has a physical presence and it can't run and hide in the internet like it's

707
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,680
it's just it's just on a chip and if i you just keep it on a flash drive in your pocket you'll flush

708
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,120
it down the toilet as soon as it starts acting a bitch hey if fucking if fucking your clone is

709
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:09,520
not gay is beating up your clone like not violent is like self-flage elation you know what are the

710
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:16,320
laws here dude guys if i could clone myself like my brain i would like immediately start an animation

711
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:24,160
studio that's just me i would love to see debu collective videos about that every day i'm just

712
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,240
like man i just thought of a funny animation i could do oh fuck there's only one of you would

713
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,080
take two wait i could i could finally get a somewhat get what someone to do textures for me and do

714
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,280
all my video editing yeah imagine they'd be miserable but i'd pay them nominally we didn't

715
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,200
really think about that but imagine like the logical extreme of that what if like one guy was

716
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,000
like okay um i'm just gonna keep making copies of myself until i can fucking run everything

717
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,560
and then he just starts like and then like 90 percent of all people are this guy now he has to

718
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,600
have all the hard drive space oh my god it's shadow clone juicier and it's fucking bad and if the

719
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:01,840
worst part is fucking bad oh no no one's in the entire universe is never on time

720
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:13,600
oh get fucked man yeah the the whole thing would like having copies of yourself like if it was

721
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,520
like physical human clones then it would be weird like who you're a human being blah blah blah

722
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,400
but if you're a robot you're let you i can program you to not care about being the main one so i

723
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:31,760
can be the main one yeah i know but like um you can argue that i definitely am interested

724
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,920
and this is something like rick and morty explores a lot where he always makes like a clone but

725
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:42,000
there's something different and it's like usually they they just like he'll say you know this clone

726
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,400
doesn't have a sense of self or like it's not basically you can abuse this thing and it is not

727
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,080
a human rights violation because it's not quite human you know or it's not quite you and i always

728
01:04:54,080 --> 01:05:00,080
find that really fascinating i always wonder what if i would use it like would i feel too bad

729
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,680
you know because like rick's always raising that like people you know other people who he

730
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,440
uh you know shows these clones are always like horrified and he's like yeah but you know it's not

731
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:15,440
it's not quite human i'm just saying you know i remember uh is rick smart enough to make an

732
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,920
argument that lets him basically do whatever he wants so he can find a way to justify you know

733
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,960
killing whoever morty just accidentally killed true you know i know like bill whittle a guy who's

734
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,440
like big into futurism and space exploration like he gets invited to like space x sometimes

735
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,040
stuff like that right and like he got invited to like some showing of some new robot like

736
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,520
animal thing it just like walks around on four legs but like intelligently reads the the terrain

737
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,360
in order to get around right and the guy and one of the engineers is like yeah it's pretty cool

738
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,840
bunk he kicks it like kicks it right in the head equivalent and like the and like the robot like

739
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:52,160
like like trying to like catch its balance and like steadily gets back up and bill was like

740
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,480
i had to restrain myself from getting mad at the man because i i felt like he had just heard

741
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,640
right i know and it's like i love watching videos of people beat up it's fucking it's

742
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,600
boston dynamics man boston dynamics the most evil people on the planet according to some robot

743
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,880
rights you know you know it's really it's it's so fascinating though because like it's it really

744
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,120
is interesting how we prescribe like uh moral consideration like that like it just because

745
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:20,320
it moves in a way that we've seen i mean things that we generally give moral consideration but

746
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,560
it was just like it was just like some random robot stiffly walking around even if it looked

747
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,640
more human it's someone knocked over like haha you know there wouldn't be any of the whole thing

748
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,480
about that to animals morality like the whole thing about like morality coming into the future

749
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,320
there's exactly one sci-fi fictional work that captures it perfectly duck dodgers in the 23rd

750
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,120
and a half century we're at the very end he's standing on this one tiny little fragment of

751
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:50,240
planet going i win that is morality in the 23rd century that sounds cool but i like i like what

752
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,320
gib was saying there we we we the the funny thing is people don't think about but like yeah we do this

753
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:59,920
to animals too people treat animals like they have quote unquote souls like humans do when they in

754
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,120
fact do not they definitely don't now pretty sure god addressed this directly in the bible uh but

755
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,720
none none of the less nonetheless uh the guy you don't believe exist is back in your argument well

756
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,760
yeah it's i use it when it's convenient sorry guys what a fucking blue-pilled cock

757
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,720
dude like okay so i was i was to answer finally the question i raised a while ago like how would

758
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,520
i adopt it right yeah this whole consciousness issue just cannot be fucking solved i mean maybe

759
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,200
there'd be some post singularity consciousness that could just convince the shit out of me

760
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,280
but then i'd be confused as to whether or not maybe it's just so smart it can trick me into

761
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,000
thinking it you know who knows but so for me the solution is pretty fucking simple like like i said

762
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
get like a body enhancing like body uh lengthening uh you know extensions or whatever and you know

763
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,120
try to and just try and do this now in my body as long as i can and eventually things might come

764
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,720
to a head and when there's no other choice then go ahead fucking upload me you know because i'm

765
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,560
going to die anyway whatever right yeah i think that's nano machines to body lengthen my penis

766
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,200
the sad truth here is that we were all born in leirang generation when it comes to this like

767
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,800
we can't like i really really hoping that i can taste a little bit of it when i'm like 70

768
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:16,640
well that's i mean i think we will all at least make it far enough for some augmentation but i

769
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,560
really want this exact same podcast to be done like every 20 years by a different like like the

770
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,360
next generation of us like our kids to do this podcast and tell us because our kids are all

771
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:33,760
going to be raised by us a bunch of fucking uh goddamn sci-fi weeaboos who are gonna like

772
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,840
rant about the glories of technology the whole time so i want to hear their opinions or they're

773
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:44,320
like oh yeah of course i'd be like we're going to they're all amish just like i want to know

774
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:49,360
they might be uh they're like oh why would i want my physical form like my ego is if anything the

775
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:54,000
only weakness i have i would i would love to be a part of the cloud you know like i don't i don't

776
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,320
know if this is likely to happen but i always kind of wonder if like what if uh will we hit a plateau

777
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,000
where people are just satisfied with a level of technology it's like where all your physical

778
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,600
needs are met oh why bother like i have another like prediction based on not really at the planet

779
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,400
but a prediction i agree based on different predictions that are right and wrong because as i

780
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,120
said you know you look at back in the past like you know 1800s people are like oh we think by the

781
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,360
year 1905 everyone will have jet packs who of course they will right um and like also let me see

782
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:29,680
what sci-fi there was like some sci-fi book from like 1870 where some guys go to the moon via canon

783
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,440
right and this was actually talked about in a book okay it was actually talked about in a book

784
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,280
about uh it was actually the art of game design a book of lenses by jessie shill but he was talking

785
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:42,320
about how at the time everyone kind of assumed that would happen or like like it's just sort of

786
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:48,720
made sense in sort of a pulpy sort of way because cannons at the time were getting a whole lot better

787
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:54,160
constantly right so the so really when you look at everyone who was wrong about the level of steam

788
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:59,360
punk that would happen by the night by the 20th century during the 19th century is because they

789
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,160
thought the same kind of rapid innovation steam technology you know machines and products and

790
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,880
stuff they thought that was going to just keep infinitely increasing and so the same thing with

791
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,640
that the same thing with uh the 60s right right right like lost in space like the year 1997 we're

792
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,560
going to leave earth and it's just because that's the whole space race was going on and like why

793
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,240
would that stop you know what it is i like that you brought the subdivided because i do sometimes i

794
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,800
lately i've had more and more doubts about computer technology actually advancing

795
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,200
because it doesn't feel like it's been advancing faster late right yeah exactly so yeah so like

796
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,720
like what i was saying before about like the internet thing right like we're computers in general

797
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,960
during the 20th century people thought like technology was going to advance more like with

798
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,080
machines or industry or something like that people didn't really see the whole computer thing coming

799
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,240
until it was too late and so one guy pointed out that they got like infinitely more powerful every

800
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,920
10 years so i can see everyone making the same mistake again which is that oh this whole progress

801
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,520
that we're making is just going to keep happening infinitely because that's our closed minded you

802
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,520
know primate brain assumption right but it could end up being something totally different it could

803
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,520
end up being just oh 3d printers fuck off 3d printers they just do everything now or it could

804
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,480
be something a fucking fidget spinners of course let's like hashtag 2017 they end up we end up in

805
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,280
like a post-singular society yeah we look up to the sky and the fidget spinners sun is just going

806
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,240
off and generating energy for everyone and we have like fidget spinners instead of hearts you know

807
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,480
oh you know what no i'm sorry that wasn't me me enough it's just going to be emoji emoji or the

808
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:38,640
secret to like all of life my prediction is that computers are going to stop the aesthetic of

809
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,320
computers and metal and sci-fi is going to get oh who cares and then they're going to go back to

810
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,560
they're going to make computers look like wood and then pirates are going to come back and i'm

811
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,640
going to be a pirate by the way give just hoping for a second dark age we can all just go back

812
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,800
yes a dark a dark age just aesthetic wise it looks like that but everything else is like

813
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,480
perfect we just turn all the lights off it's a dark age how's this how's this for a millennial

814
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,560
perspective when before did you said something like how technology needs to keep advancing people

815
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,800
won't give up because we need to get off the planet i was going to really say as a real counter

816
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,240
argument yeah well that didn't work for krypton now did it you idiot and then i thought for a

817
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,160
second i was like oh wait a minute well i was thinking what my train of thought went after

818
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:29,440
that is really we have to escape the universe because the whole universe dies eventually so

819
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,080
guys we've only got like six trillion years left we've got to do something exactly we're on the

820
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,000
we gotta rise above our three-dimensional limits and we have to

821
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,160
no incidentally that's what that show kato is about yeah unfortunately it doesn't explore this

822
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,640
we need to yeah you're right we need to break our 3d limits you may need to vibrate higher to

823
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,720
leave this earth of 3d to one earth of 4d or 5d going to the 5d is exactly what we need to do

824
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:01,120
yugioh 5d's was the answer all along here we go baby tom i want to just do everything on motorcycles

825
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,120
that's the solution i was really glad that tom um that you explained what you would do the same

826
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:14,960
way you did four years ago on uh on a different podcast because you really like i've thought

827
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,040
when i think about transhumanism i think about it in terms of what tom said about how like

828
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,600
all your organs and stuff can just fail and like that to me is what makes it feel urgent

829
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,320
like we could talk about this is like sci-fi concepts we all want but like when i think about

830
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:36,960
my fucking physical form and how shit it is and like right like my brother very fine dude my brother

831
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:43,680
and victor had to have his pancreas removed because it almost exploded but the pain not not the pancreas

832
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,960
i meant the um the appendix his appendix had to be removed because he got appendicitis and it

833
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,280
would have blown up and what happens if your appendix explodes is that it can damage your other

834
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:00,080
organs and kill you well what does your appendix do literally nothing the only thing the appendix

835
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:08,160
is there for is to explode and kill you uh so why the fuck have we not figured out like why is that

836
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,160
not just something we can remove at birth well because it's too dangerous to operate i hear that

837
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:18,080
every single time that the appendix is pointless that it can't be completely pointless it's that it

838
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,720
wants to have a point but it doesn't just like your tonsils like that's why if you get if you keep

839
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,360
getting tonsillitis they just take them out because they don't actually do anything we had them in a

840
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,800
time where we're like the air of the earth was different you know we're a perpetual transitional

841
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,760
form yeah there's so much there's lots of fucking design craft in our dna and it's bullshit did you

842
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,720
did you entirely right it digested plant matter i think i could be thinking the wrong thing whatever

843
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,640
it is it we don't need it because that's why they can just take it out like if you get appendicitis

844
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,920
they just remove the thing oh yeah and you you don't miss it oh and you guys zero cases of people

845
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,600
you guys know like goose bumps that's because it's supposed to make your first stand up on it

846
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,280
to make it look bigger that's right to make it look bigger to strength predators and shit

847
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,480
indeed indeed i did not know that incidentally yeah uh well does anybody have anything else

848
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,240
to say about transhumanism or do we want to move into questions because i got a bunch of good

849
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:19,760
trains humanism i like i want to be oh yeah i think i think the thing to take relish in is that

850
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,200
eventually we're gonna have to iterate on all this technology really fast because when the

851
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,960
technological singularity does happen and we have machines that are smarter than humans

852
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,640
we're all gonna feel really bad about it because we have fragile egos and that's when we're gonna

853
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,680
become i remember being in digi's kitchen one time talking about like a cgp great like one of

854
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,360
his episodes of the hello internet where he was like yeah you know guys like i don't know if i'm

855
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,320
really into like like a beyond human ai at this point because like think about it like yeah we

856
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,400
think they'll have our interests in mind but like they're more intelligent to us imagine if like

857
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,520
gorillas had invented humans imagine if gorillas made humans you think that would turn out well

858
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,480
and shade walked up behind me and said that all of them sucked

859
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:12,240
oh fuck i wanted to keep going but i just want to end on that no there's nothing i can add it's

860
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,960
better yeah it's pretty good um the most important thing about this is just this all needs to happen

861
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,840
before i specifically die absolutely the only thing that matters well they agree let's get a

862
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,640
move on to transition into questions because the first one is super relevant that i found okay um

863
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:32,880
from gray nine he asks scientists announce we will be in a post scarcity society by next week

864
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:40,160
what plans do you make oh fuck complicated uh i mean what i do is i quit my job immediately and

865
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:45,440
just start doing the content i want to do all the time i i guess that would be my first because

866
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,080
like i don't know what's gonna happen once it happens so i have to worry about all that

867
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,880
shit i have a really specific answer i would uh tell all those people who are uh poised to

868
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,360
adopt some of my baby hamsters no thanks man i'm printing myself some more cages and a bigger room

869
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:09,600
that's adorable i i would um spend i would forget about youtube because fuck it dude that's not

870
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,360
that important i would spend all of my time writing homes uh horse stuff oh yeah i would write

871
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,880
and i would make it twice as long as homestuck because i have all the time in the world so does

872
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,800
post scarcity society mean that none of us need jobs of course i think true okay yeah honestly i

873
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,800
probably stopped when we had to focus on other projects yeah i'm immediately off the internet

874
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:38,800
forever first of all um all i do is make really fucking weird shit with munchie that's my oh yeah

875
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,920
yeah all right right scarcity we'd all just got we'd no money yeah just hang out one place

876
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,720
does much still need to finish school in a post scarcity world i don't know but me and munchie

877
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,240
are just gonna hang out and like headbutt things like oh you know i'll make a whole like i'll make

878
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,600
a whole thing like other i don't even want to film this for myself i don't want to post this on youtube

879
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,560
i just want me and munchie to become so known for headbutting things that people start recording

880
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:11,360
us and like we get funded by like sponsorships and like movie deals you know on on that front

881
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:17,760
not the money funding yeah right on that front i would immediately go find a place for pcb hq

882
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,000
that's immediately what i would do fucking like man made island on the pacific bitch

883
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,920
wherever's appropriate i would be in the shape of the pcb it's just so it's really hard the only

884
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,400
reason i'm not doing that now is because of money i can't think of how to imagine the world without

885
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,840
needing money like i can't like doesn't it seem like the obvious answer is i'll just go fuck all day

886
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,480
like i'll just have sex and drink and smoke oh here i think there's nothing about post

887
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,880
post scarcity society that it's always interested me is people imagine like people frame it like

888
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,160
oh it's like going to be this utopia thing where there's no need to work or anything money is just

889
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,920
a me like the only reason people even really want money is because what it facilitates it

890
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,800
facilitates power it facilitates status yeah and like your desire for power and status does not go

891
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,800
away if you don't need money because you still have to have some way to obtain those things is there

892
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,560
no i don't think society is going to change as much as we all think it will just pull scarcity

893
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,480
mean that there is no scarcity of marijuana does that well probably 3d print it you probably

894
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,760
3d print that dude no like 3d print myself weed and watch everything ever you know you that's

895
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,880
what i mean already 3d print weed it's called planting it and growing it my friend he's not

896
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,120
he's not wrong but you know that that honestly does that does bring in an interesting question

897
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,040
because though the idea of like pcp hq it is a money making operation at the end of the day and

898
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,680
as tom said like that still will be necessary but like my plans for to get everybody here together

899
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:45,440
to do that do hinge on the idea that you guys will be motivated to make content you know to make money

900
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,600
and maybe that would change i don't know i see it in eight is that the difference between uh

901
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,200
priest scarcity and post scarcity pcp scarcity pcp is we all meet up in one place to make

902
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,720
the best content we've ever made post scarcity is we all meet up and we exclusively make the

903
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:07,360
blue glow like that's all let's play like all we do is let's play 24 7 because all we want to do

904
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,480
is play video games like so what i've come to realize now now that i've started playing video

905
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,520
games again um which i've been doing for the last like couple months i've been playing lots of games

906
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,000
and i realized that i have no real desire to do anything but play video games and listen to the

907
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:30,720
dick show because i feel totally opposed to that exactly we gotta we gotta no go ahead nate

908
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,280
oh okay but i was just gonna say i i know where you're coming from but but here's the thing

909
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:41,680
uh for most of my life i did exactly that i watched anime and played video games it's

910
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,560
it's only recently that i have felt the best about myself in my life that i ever have because

911
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,960
i'm finally accomplishing something but that's because made my life in a society where those

912
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:57,520
things are not helpful to do well but but that's no matter what we do humans are social animals and

913
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,320
we we want to have like i'm not i'm not afraid to say it like now that i have a little bit of

914
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:07,280
like power in society like i have an audience that respects me to some degree and people like what i

915
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,520
do and i have something to offer that allows me to have a little bit of influence it's it's those

916
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:17,360
factors that appeal to me inherently as a human male probably women too but for me for me personally

917
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,040
like a hundred percent of all the problems in my life are tied to my influence and talking to

918
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:28,080
other people so maybe that's why i'm going to the other regrets and perhaps i agree with either of

919
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,600
you my motivation for doing things is entirely because i feel like i have an obligation as a human

920
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,320
being to to to use my skills and my talents in the best way that i can the the only reason i want

921
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,400
an audience is because i need money and that's the best way to get it for doing the work that i

922
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,880
want to do and the only reason i bother doing like fucking gay youtube shit that can easily

923
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,960
generate money is because i need that money if i didn't need money i would do nothing that would

924
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,320
get me in that i would not focus on building an audience because i don't care about that i wouldn't

925
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,280
focus on money because it wouldn't exist i'm curious though i'm curious though doesn't your

926
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,800
top doesn't your work only have meaning because it has an audience yeah that's what i was gonna

927
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,800
bring up but for me i don't i don't think so at all well for me at least when i was younger

928
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,520
for the lirth for the first like ten years for the first ten years that i made things i had no

929
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,000
audience at all and i was right upset that i didn't but it didn't stop me from making it i wanted to

930
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,680
not because i want i mean of course you want an audience to see it but even if you had told me

931
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,400
tell me right now that like your project will never have an audience because i'm already working

932
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,680
under that assumption that's why i put so much effort now and trying to be more active on the

933
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,000
pcps i'm assuming this is how i'm going to make money and the content i actually want to do is

934
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,240
never going to get the level of success that would need to be my job but that doesn't i have no

935
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,840
intention of stopping to do it because that's like the only thing i feel that like gives my life

936
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,840
actual meaning about yeah for me it's i hear what you're saying it's just that specifically the

937
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,320
you're talking about consuming art though and like the the the use that art has in the world

938
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,320
is that people see it and then like enjoy it and stuff right so like isn't that just an inherent

939
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,680
part of the thing that i've been trying to talk about this whole time is is is that in the post

940
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:04,800
scarcity society people won't need huge audiences but they can all yeah like you know anything i want

941
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:10,000
to make right is for a few people i'm not yeah i want i want to make the horse stuck thing yeah

942
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,960
to impress anyone who likes home stuck and myself and close friends and if it's an audience of a

943
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,520
maximum of 20 people it wouldn't matter to me because that's all i was making it for i was

944
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,680
making for me and a few other people i agree with that it's like i don't be for everyone i'm not

945
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,440
saying i don't want an audience and i wouldn't like it i'm just saying it's complete the work

946
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,600
that i want to do i want to do because i want to see it exist you know it's you know it's interesting

947
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,600
that's why i want to go to to pcphq by the way is is is to hang out with you and the content made

948
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,840
like in let's play form can entertain a few people but the the the reason i would move is so that i

949
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,000
could hang out with you and it'll be like fun and i totally agree but this this is very interesting

950
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
to me this strikes me as a fundamental difference in what we're like what what our goals are because

951
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,600
my goal is specifically to communicate like my ideas to people and have them receive them which

952
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,320
is why like my my really primary goal is to is to package them in a way that both i enjoy

953
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,240
but that people will be receptive to so that they'll hear what i'm saying and like i think i'm right

954
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,320
so i want them to hear me and be swayed by my opinion so like that that's what i'm aiming for

955
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,440
the vehicle to get there is is open to me i think the difference between is because you're trying to

956
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,680
you're you're more worried you're trying to communicate your ideas like your videos have a

957
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:24,480
point like this is my opinion on something right right in order to make the the art i guess of that

958
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,800
you it needs to affect as many people as possible where like my like passion project is like telling

959
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,040
a story and like i don't need to prove it to anybody i just wanted to exist so i think because

960
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:38,480
the goals of those projects are different i totally get both of you because i there's like

961
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:44,160
when i make a video like here's this thing about anime that everybody's getting wrong like the only

962
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,720
real value in that is correcting other people's minds when i make like my music i don't give a

963
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:57,280
single fuck who listens to it like i if i have like one person buying it that's fine i just want

964
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,720
it to exist for my own sake because it's something that i needed to be off of my chest you know and

965
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:07,920
i think i would go much more down that road um if i had you know if i didn't have to worry about

966
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,640
yeah i guess okay like i guess i hear what you're saying specific plans if post guarantees announced

967
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:18,560
i would tell degi hey uh you know if you want to fucking have me edit any videos go ahead but no

968
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:27,680
schedule i'm not gonna write anything right i'm not gonna write a single video ever again if i

969
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,360
don't need money well i'll guess i'll just go watch anime occasionally and then also i think i'd

970
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:36,720
still i think i just spent all my time just making a game except uh it would have all the things i

971
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:41,440
wanted to be in a game rather than some of the things heavily censored that i'm planning on

972
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:48,320
putting it in my game well get what were you saying gib i was gonna say like in in this society

973
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:54,640
where it would be like all the artists are suddenly making what they want and all of the people on

974
01:25:54,640 --> 01:26:00,880
youtube who are doing clickbait will die because they don't care about it oh yeah finally the art

975
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,280
landscape would change overnight you know what's fascinating i just watched like rice gums uh like

976
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,360
reaction to the to the roast of him or whatever and he was talking about like how this is what he

977
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,360

our personal careers if the pcp made enough money to just be our day job it's very true very true um

988
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,400
vampire giffy asks a two-part question what is your best project that never saw the light of day

989
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,840
and what is the worst thing you've made that has seen the light of day

990
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:24,160
nate you could start us off if you uh if you want oh man i mean the the the first part things that

991
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:30,000
have not seen the light of day extensive work i mean i have not made anything that is good that

992
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,440
i have not released i was actually just talking to you guys the other day about how like i have

993
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,080
never completed a video and then not released it ever i i mean i don't spend time on things it doesn't

994
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:43,040
have to be completed let's just say like the best project idea that fell through you know

995
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,320
fell through i mean there's there's always a like that you've abandoned yeah like if there's a project

996
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:54,080
that you were working on that you feel like would have been amazing but it has not been completed

997
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,840
and i mean i'm well known to have taken a very long time to actually release my best anime ever

998
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,560
ghost in the shell which i but it will eventually but it will but there are several other projects

999
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,200
that i have not announced of that same ilk that like i know things about them and have produced

1000
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,440
pieces of them already but they are there are ways out uh but in terms of things that got

1001
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,240
dropped i mean there's always what me and ben talked about of the raise these bros which i actually did

1002
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,120
make a song for uh for like it was going to be like the finale of t-bap or something uh but we

1003
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,920
never that's what that was never got around to it yeah yeah that song floats around in my hard drive

1004
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:34,480
somewhere all right oh and but uh in terms of things that are bad that i did release i mean

1005
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:40,320
i think i generally make good stuff ben and i did a ice bucket challenge on t-bap a while ago

1006
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,720
yeah that wasn't great that wasn't great though it did have a cool storyline where my glasses broke

1007
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:50,240
or rather keg standard not me his glasses broke and uh that was very sad i don't know it's all

1008
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:54,320
great everything i've ever made is fantastic i can answer it pretty quickly i mean maybe these

1009
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,280
projects i mean i've had one idea for a song parody that would require like like a slideshow

1010
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:03,680
animation in order to make sense and i've had it as an idea for like four years i've never told

1011
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,520
anyone on the internet about it because i might still do it whatever i mean really the biggest

1012
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,080
thing that i seem to systemically be unable to motivate myself to finish is like a big analysis

1013
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,960
of the mario and luigi series because it's just overwhelming because when i really start to think

1014
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:22,160
about it critically i honestly think there is enough there that's all original points that are

1015
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,760
not redundant off of existing analysis videos of any game at all it's like it's like it's honestly

1016
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:33,040
as dense with like things to talk about as like the star wars prequels so i mean not quite as like

1017
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,160
culturally relevant of course not by a long shot but like it would just be a huge fucking project

1018
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:42,960
that i could honestly spend a whole year on so i end up tensing up and just not caring enough right

1019
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,280
if something reminds me about the current mario and luigi games that makes me upset it only lasts

1020
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,800
until the afternoon and i just wasted like some hours typing up some shit on google drive or even

1021
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,960
recording something so that's stupid talk about like the worst thing i've made i mean if you're

1022
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:02,400
gonna be technical there's like a shitload of just boring tweets so just biggest failure in my eyes

1023
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:08,400
was when i did a video on big hero six and like just has so many great analysis things to say but

1024
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:13,680
i like that video yeah but i pushed it through so many stupid like misguided writing techniques

1025
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,360
that it's like you really can't appreciate how much analysis is in it like when i was writing it up

1026
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,200
until even when i released it was like months later when i went back to it and was like oh right

1027
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:28,720
the audience hasn't all you say that's the would you say that's the worst thing you've put out or

1028
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:34,080
just no one that is the most discordant from what it was yeah yeah yeah not all the worst thing of

1029
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,680
course because like worst thing is a stupid thing to talk about when you're when you're an internet

1030
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:42,000
content creator my right fellas but no that's the one where it's like i wrote it based on the idea

1031
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,360
that you had just seen the movie twice and also taking notes like i was it's a stupid lack of empathy

1032
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,880
with the audience like completely fucked up on and when i watch it back i'm like there's no way you

1033
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,640
can actually appreciate my points oh and also i still was not even decent at audio narration too

1034
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:01,200
so it's just hard to even listen to so when i think about it yeah the distance between how i

1035
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:06,720
thought about it at the time versus now it's that one okay tom do you have an answer for this

1036
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,440
i think the best idea that i've dropped and hopefully someday i'll come back to it when

1037
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,480
i have the the skill to properly realize it because i think it's probably the greatest

1038
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:21,200
idea i've ever had is uh it started out as a as a just a narrative story but i realized that the

1039
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:25,360
point i was trying to tell would be way better as a game um i don't want to get too much into it

1040
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,200
because like even to talk about the idea would spoil it and i do still want to make it someday

1041
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:33,120
but it's a game that would have a dynamic art style and the as the art style changes throughout

1042
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:38,000
the game it also reinforces the thematic points going on in it that's fucking cool damn um

1043
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:44,000
it's got likes but that's cool it's it's oh god it's if i can that's the one number one reason

1044
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,680
i want transhumanism probably need like another 70 years to get good enough to make this game

1045
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:54,480
properly so get on it people um and the worst thing that i've ever released is everything

1046
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:59,360
that was on my very first youtube channel that mercifully i deleted so no one can ever find it

1047
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:08,960
thank god hippo um uh yeah i've i've got a thing uh the best thing that i never got around to

1048
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,960
was an idea i had while listening to pink floyd and it was to animate the entirety of pink floyd's

1049
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:22,160
the wall but replacing the characters uh in the songs with my little pony

1050
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:32,080
i would i would imagine that's the best idea that never saw who is who is have a cigar about

1051
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:38,240
who's the have a cigar that's not in the wall oh i fucked up it's the wrong oh god damn okay never

1052
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:45,120
mind i also had an idea for animating uh the division bell uh to be about uh dick masterson

1053
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:50,800
and and matters and that that whole thing not bad because a lot of those songs are like oh it

1054
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,920
you can just imagine them talking to each other singing to each other like this

1055
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:00,080
it's great but uh you know never ever gonna have the time to animate something like that

1056
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:06,160
and also copyright would not let me monetize it afterwards so nope um but the the worst thing

1057
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:18,800
i did publish was uh i don't know some why it's okay to clop you degenerate pony fucker

1058
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,520
i've been on to you that's an okay no i actually like that video a lot i'm just mimin you i i i've

1059
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:29,360
made like a couple like eh whatever sort of vlogs i guess i don't know i don't pay attention to the

1060
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:37,200
my failures it's a bad idea i as a contact yeah you're going um i have no idea how to answer this

1061
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:46,400
because i have so many answers for both like i have like gallons of unreleased content like

1062
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,040
and and the thing is that these days i've sort of been going back through a lot of it and just

1063
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:58,240
like releasing the concepts and shit like you know my my novel i wrote back in 2010 like for six years

1064
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:02,720
that would have probably been the best thing that never saw the light of day but now i've gone ahead

1065
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:09,520
and just released it unfinished under the internet um tons and tons of great story concepts my personal

1066
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:16,080
favorite has always been um maho shoujo to henshin papa which is the the the magical girl and

1067
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:21,520
transforming dad where separately a daughter and father the daughter becomes a magical girl and the

1068
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,840
dad becomes a transforming hero and they don't they're not even aware of it but then eventually

1069
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:31,840
they have to work together um but like i i just have like a thousand ideas i have tons of analysis

1070
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:37,680
videos that have never been made album ideas songs that i have fully written in my head but

1071
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:43,040
because i cannot perform instruments there is no way to translate them to um to the internet except

1072
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:49,520
in acapella versions that i've released just as like proof of concept of their existence um

1073
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,680
actually interesting you mentioned that digi i remember watching the diaries like the the

1074
01:34:53,680 --> 01:35:00,320
production diaries for uh that m dot strange guy he had for uh his third film and he showed this

1075
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:06,320
production of like you can get a vst that um you hum and it takes that and applies it to any

1076
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:13,440
instrument made the entire soundtrack oh my god i i need that badly fascinating that is the coolest

1077
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,440
shit i've ever heard of yeah and if i can find it i will use it immediately that's always in the

1078
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,920
back of my head of like if i ever start getting into animation for real and i need to do music

1079
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,320
that's that's the way i'm gonna do it yeah and as for the worst thing i've made that's seen the

1080
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:33,520
light of day this is equally difficult to answer because i've been on the internet since 2001

1081
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,400
and like i've never deleted anything like there's some stuff that's set to private but it saw the

1082
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:45,280
light of day at some point um what comes to mind first is the otaku sex hotline what what what i've

1083
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:52,800
never heard of this i told i told this story in detail on a recent digi in may i think no on a

1084
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:59,280
pub crawl a recent pub crawl i told this story but uh but to summarize i had a tumblr that was

1085
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:05,600
supposed to be for people to like tell us about their like weird otaku-based sex hangups and we

1086
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:11,680
would like give advice except the real reason it existed was so that i eventually could just post

1087
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:19,920
my weird sex hangups and answer it myself and after after that happened which was probably

1088
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:25,600
like the seventh post on the blog it completely died like no one everyone was just in abject

1089
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,520
horror of what i had done what of anything you've released on the internet are you the most

1090
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,080
ashamed of to think about right now if you want to divulge that well that was what came to mind

1091
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:44,480
first oh yeah that's a good sign that or like just tons of writing about like otaku sexuality i did

1092
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:53,040
that doesn't hold up uh back back in the 2010 or so um lots of youtube videos that are just

1093
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:59,600
cringe worthy some of them are entertaining though like there's one digi bro digi digital boy cracks

1094
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:06,160
open the double down where i just review the double down from kfc but i'm like so awkward and creepy

1095
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:12,240
looking that it's like watching him like a murderer rapist eat a double down um there's just a lot

1096
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,320
like there's tons and tons of content i've made because i've been on the internet for so fucking

1097
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:22,880
long and most of it's most of it's cringe worthy i remember the time you pretended to be a pony and

1098
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:30,000
you were running around that i'm very proud of that's awesome um i've rewatched that recently

1099
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,400
because of victor being in that and just like that's what made it great poor poor guy i don't know

1100
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:40,560
what the worst thing i've made like since becoming a popular youtuber is like there's a couple videos

1101
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:46,560
i've made that i wasn't proud of like uh sort of infamously i had just hidden my um zanko notera

1102
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:53,040
video because i thought it was so badly written um like there's been a few but not most of the

1103
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,600
stuff i make has some entertainment value to it like even if it's not amazing there's something

1104
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:02,720
good about it but if you go back through my history it's just a non-stop wave of infinite cringe so

1105
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:10,160
yeah there's lots to choose from so my answer for both is everything i've ever made let's let's move

1106
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:15,920
on to the next question um what loot will you drop when you die oh that's a good one wait who

1107
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:22,880
who said who said that that's from dry bones god damn i oh i would definitely be a pile of sunglasses

1108
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:35,280
a pile of sunglasses yes for sure for sure i'd drop like two mountain dews um a a pack of cigarettes

1109
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:43,200
and uh and also sunglasses but of a different sort yes indeed i would drop uh basically economics

1110
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,440
by tomas soul which you can't remove and you can't remove it from your inventory it's like

1111
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:52,240
stuck in your inventory and it like takes up one weight and you're so pissed off at it forever

1112
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,960
just like how it weighs on your mind that that forbidden knowledge every day to do

1113
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:05,680
a yes i understand get what do you got i can't top that i can't fucking think of anything

1114
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:12,160
you you'd uh it's just a hippo plush guitar uh yeah hippo plush that's that's or guitar strings

1115
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:20,320
yeah that'd be good maybe a poof of hair that was good hey if we have any that's all the same

1116
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,040
that's called cutting my hair or if we have that's your escape tactics you're like a wobba

1117
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:29,120
we're gonna do any more just your hair we're gonna do any more questions you cut my whole body up

1118
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,160
that was the true form doing any more questions i gotta go so i i guess i'll just leave now unless

1119
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:41,120
we're done uh you can go ahead a little bit longer cool so i'm gonna i'm just gonna post in the

1120
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,600
discord my answers to things by listening on my phone and if someone wants to read it out they can

1121
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:53,040
yeah other than that i'll see you all right all right uh tom tom and you um i think mine would

1122
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:58,000
probably be an unidentified stylist and when you go to identify it you find out it's cursed and now

1123
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:05,680
you have good you have talent but infinite depression ah god damn i love the thoroughness

1124
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:12,080
of that answer it's perfect oh man god damn bed would definitely be like a stylist in a vape for

1125
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,280
sure for sure just the vape let's be real yeah you're right you're right it'd be a vape stylist

1126
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:23,840
like two in one yes the ultimate combo i uh this one this one might be difficult but i thought it

1127
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:30,800
was interesting because it's so precise duck chutney asks favorite character design oh jeez

1128
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:40,160
full stop favorite character shadow the hedgehog yeah killer kills pretty good anime um i uh i

1129
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:46,080
actually like ryuko is at near the top of my list for sure that's what i said ryuko doesn't very

1130
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:51,920
ryuko in her um like her normal outfit is like extremely i like it a lot it's very good i also

1131
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,520
like her transform because she does look like shadow it's pretty great um i don't know it's

1132
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,920
going to sound lazy but i love everything about how kami looks you know i'm not really a big tattoo

1133
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,960
guy he's yeah he's fantastic and the color design across the series unbelievable but uh i've never

1134
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,840
been a big tattoo guy but just like this is not limited to anime by the way like it's any character

1135
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,520
design that you right that's just where my mind goes i'm gonna come back with another answer

1136
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:20,080
somebody else go uh oh i have a good one uh mind fang from homestuck i forget who that is

1137
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:26,800
it's it's risco's ancestor the cool pirate's right queen apparently she's got that cool sword and

1138
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:32,960
the in the coat yeah apparently i really like wants to shout out power puff girls z the anime

1139
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,400
version power puff girls um what oh yeah those things were pretty cool i'm gonna have to give

1140
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:43,280
my answer as the one character design that i've by far spent the most time obsessing

1141
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:50,080
with which is remilia scarlet from toho of course yeah because i she's got everything immortal

1142
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:58,080
lollies pink uh she's vampire i'm i'm into all those things and like just the way that even more

1143
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:04,560
so than the character design herself the way that um artists will always draw her in like a very red

1144
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:10,160
world like like like when you look at art of remilia the whole background is always different

1145
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,400
shades of scarlet like and it's funny because it's her actual character design doesn't really

1146
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:19,120
have much red on it but like it's just kind of interpreted as fitting into that world i guess

1147
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:28,480
and uh i like yeah yeah um here's a grab bag just a couple uh i i love uh uh griffith i love uh the

1148
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,840
way yeah griffith is dope um i just i i know it's expected but nia i just like nia's character

1149
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:39,840
design is like so creative and awesome it's like unbelievable and uh and then finally uh her her

1150
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,400
fucking hair like it's it's never been done before no one's ever had nia's hair and it's like the

1151
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:49,680
best looking hair ever especially short nia is i yeah i love short hair nia with her with her pink

1152
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:55,280
ass hoodie god she looks fantastic and finally uh ramza lugria in his second and third armor forms

1153
01:42:55,280 --> 01:43:00,400
not his basic bitch order of the north sky one that's for pussies there you go that's all right the

1154
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:08,960
gobs asks what is your biggest pet peeve with amateur content creators um it's it's proceeding

1155
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:14,640
proceeding a video it's it's proceeding a video with talking about how they haven't made a video

1156
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:21,200
oh my god yeah dude fuck yeah or just like all the preamble the endless preamble up to the

1157
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:28,640
fucking pretty much my thing is having to explain why you're making it having to like like just cut

1158
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:36,000
just give us the content we don't need like the background of how you came about to doing it

1159
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,400
you know because it's always the same story it's not like you did not have some unique epiphany

1160
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,720
you just thought like it's almost always at first i didn't think the show would have much to talk about

1161
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:54,560
but turns out it did and it's like yeah otherwise you wouldn't have made a video you know what honestly

1162
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,920
i love those because now i just laugh when i see them i laugh the whole time like the the worst part

1163
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,560
about those is that there's sometimes there's videos that i know are supposed to have an

1164
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:10,320
interesting point and it bothers me so much i can't watch the video like i've had my cardinal sin i

1165
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:15,040
still do that to this day i think i've recorded something today that has that in it you know what

1166
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:19,120
it's not even a joke you know people have like and there's ways to do it fine like if you have a lot

1167
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:23,680
of charisma or if you've worded well enough like it can be okay but like especially if someone's

1168
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:29,920
stumbling through that it's just like dude fucking you had this in the editing bay you had time to

1169
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:36,640
look at this and conclude it was not interesting you know the thing the thing i would suggest people

1170
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,080
look at as like an example of how to do it good is because you know everyone likes to have an intro

1171
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:49,840
or some sort of logo but if you watch tom scott's videos he starts his videos um just talking immediately

1172
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,560
immediately about the point and he's usually on camera and always wears a red shirt his brand

1173
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,560
is his face on the red shirt he doesn't need an intro he doesn't need a logo he just talks about

1174
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:05,680
cool shit and everyone loves him he's a good boy so do that i agree um i and he's the only

1175
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:12,000
fucking like like content every week youtuber i can name who does not stretch their videos at all

1176
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,880
like they're always exactly he'll he'll fly to fucking alaska and only make a three minute video

1177
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:23,760
out of it you know right okay yeah i remember that guy yeah he's he's good um i was gonna say i uh i

1178
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:29,840
always am this isn't like a major criticism but people with just like very bad audio quality

1179
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:33,280
that's just like a click off it's not like i hate them i'm just like okay i'm just not gonna watch

1180
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:38,160
well you can't listen to it it hurts i haven't seen a video with bad audio quality you know

1181
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:44,240
long time i i have but it's from it's not just the like clarity of the audio it's if you have

1182
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,040
fucking noise in the background it's the fan noise if you got that if the noise is almost as loud

1183
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,080
as your voice then it's like i literally can't listen to that you know but i just never i haven't

1184
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:59,840
seen a video like that just like was trying i have some in mind but i don't want to shout them out

1185
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:05,280
because i don't want to be mean um but there was uh like just like my hero trump instead of answering

1186
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,680
this question i'm also going to answer the question that i wish i was asked and uh it's it's actually

1187
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:14,400
it's the opposite of this it's what's what's something that annoys me about like too good

1188
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,760
too pro animators and i will shout this guy out i don't hate this guy at all but like hold

1189
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:26,320
in anime reviews i don't hate this man but what is what is baffling about his videos is the unbelievable

1190
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,680
over editing and it's not like it is distracting visually how he will just say he'll talk for

1191
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:37,600
like three minutes and animate every single word individually it's like i have to stop watching

1192
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:42,240
because i'm like i cannot believe we invested the amount of time to go do this i've never made it

1193
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:46,480
through that section of one of his videos before neither have i it's a brick fucking wall and i

1194
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:50,560
don't hate the guy at all it's just like that just just like wow what what is this all right this one

1195
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:58,240
i have no hate for you um gypsy ask oh and uh davoo's answer to that was complacency um gypsy

1196
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:05,040
asks what's the worst recommendation you've ever given a friend um

1197
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:12,240
my love fly across the country to come live with me i'll totally make vlogs you know davoo might

1198
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,720
talk shit about that but but he grew he grew he that was a good experience for him to have i just

1199
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:21,280
thought that'd be a really funny answer unfortunately he's not he's not in the call he's i hope he's

1200
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:26,720
laughing his ass if he's listening still well it's edit in some laughs after this yeah uh

1201
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:34,400
shit i i only give great advice i don't know well it's a recommendation so it could just be

1202
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:39,040
like a show you told somebody to watch and they absolutely hated it i mean i've given a few

1203
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:45,440
bad recommendations like that before hmm just where i didn't didn't i don't often i'm stumped by

1204
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:50,880
this i don't often recommend things to people unless i know that that is their sort of thing

1205
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:57,440
yeah but maybe as a so i guess i haven't really well as a kid i don't give a shit about stuff

1206
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,320
yeah i'm like i'm really thinking back and i have pretty much stopped giving a shit what

1207
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:06,880
other people do just in all aspects of life as long as it's not causing me a problem i'm just

1208
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,480
too busy to worry about anyone or like you go figure out your life on your own go watch whatever

1209
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,560
you want it's funny hearing you guys say this stuff because like i'm someone who is constantly

1210
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:21,280
recommending things to everyone always like not just shows but like all i do is like try to

1211
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:26,160
counsel other people on how to run their lives and i don't know why it's a compulsion of mine i

1212
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:32,640
think it's based on my name because my name conrad it means honest counselor and i've known that

1213
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,200
since i was a little kid and like tried to live up to it sounds like a calm to me so so like all

1214
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:43,600
i do is try to like counsel people on how to run their lives and usually i give good advice most

1215
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:50,000
people tell me i generally give good advice but sometimes i've given advice that has not led people

1216
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,520
to a happier life sure i mean i'm thinking like my channel consists of a lot of recommendations

1217
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,080
these days like recommending that uh takagi san anime it just that just comes to mind but that

1218
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,000
that's great and everyone should read it i don't know yeah i mean when it comes to like youtube

1219
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,440
stuff i recommend things that i like and i explain why i like them but i don't know how i can tell

1220
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,800
whether somebody was like misinformed unless they tell me like i don't feel like people were

1221
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,600
misinformed and they they actually didn't like it yeah based on what i said in my video by the way

1222
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:24,080
this is the worst recommendation you've ever given a friend not just random strangers uh yeah well

1223
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:29,040
yeah i mean i don't know i guess i could i i i know this is ridiculous for me to bring up but like

1224
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:33,600
i tried because i love it so much i tried to get my friends to watch gurren log in with me in in

1225
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:38,880
college and like god they were just not into it they just did not give you never like tried to like a

1226
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,040
wingman for somebody and then the girl turned out to be shit like told someone to pursue

1227
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:48,320
a relationship or like a lifestyle choice that just didn't work out for the ones who always

1228
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,840
fucked up in those choices in those situations we're the friends though like they didn't just

1229
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,480
go hard enough on whatever it was that i was demanding that they do tom you know like they

1230
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:01,280
fucked it up or do if you're still don't talk to people in real life so this never happens

1231
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:06,880
oh jesus our knees are also an aspect of me like i'm i'm never really the one giving recommendations

1232
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,840
because i'm not the one talking to people i felt like when i asked that question if anybody had one

1233
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,640
that would come to mind immediately like like that's the kind i think that guy was hoping for a real

1234
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:23,920
juicy story but uh i think you're all anti social fucking peasants that just lock ourselves in our

1235
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,560
rooms and make youtube videos so indeed let me throw out this question from the from the twitter here

1236
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:36,000
from uh at this dorky guy oh great name dude uh yeah it's uh guys have any opinions on game length

1237
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,160
does anyone feel like you're owed when you buy a 60 dollar game where this fashion comes from

1238
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:43,840
this is twitter that's just twitter okay does anyone feel like they're owed a certain amount of

1239
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,760
time when they buy a game of a certain price i hope the game is as short as possible even when

1240
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,680
you pay like 60 bucks for i won't pay 60 dollars for a video game like oh that's just being idiot

1241
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,280
just like monkey island told us not to way back in the day i live by that every day

1242
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:06,800
no talking about i i don't like paying money so when a game is more than 20 bucks 20 pounds

1243
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:12,560
i'm not i'm sort of like i really really need to i have me i need a reason to play this i'll you

1244
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:21,040
know yeah i did yeah it's too much too much um 60 dollars never doesn't matter if it's like a million

1245
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:26,480
hours of the exactly my favorite game ever i don't i don't want to spend that money so

1246
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:34,720
how much was i think i got dark souls on sale i think that's the thing when it's on sale um i don't

1247
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:38,720
i don't know i'm not thinking of i can't really think of the money and the length because dark

1248
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:43,600
souls i've played over and over and over and over again so it has a lot of length in it kind of

1249
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:50,480
and there's lots of different ways to go about playing the game so i guess what i what does game

1250
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:54,640
length mean the amount of time it takes to get a hundred percent it's basically asking do you think

1251
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:58,800
that a game has to be long in order for it to justify how much you paid for it

1252
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:08,480
i i think i think um i mean it depends on the length obviously but i think

1253
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:17,040
a game feels more cool when you it takes you know more than an hour more than a couple hours more

1254
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:23,280
than a day i i on the other hand if it takes me more than two days then i don't care enough to

1255
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:28,000
finish it like it's never gonna happen i think it definitely depends on the game and the mechanics

1256
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,520
like i think every game has a set of mechanics and i think they all have a certain amount of shelf

1257
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:36,640
life so yeah i think it totally depends on the game like i'm really just trying to think of of

1258
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:41,120
like really short games because i generally don't like the idea of really short games it just feels

1259
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,200
wrong yeah like i feel like they're for something that i'm done with if it's a game i want to play

1260
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:50,720
over and over again like down well short for you two can like i mean it depends on the price

1261
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:55,920
and probably like the platform and shit but it's not unreasonable to expect a certain amount of

1262
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,480
game length from a game it's just a question of what that length is i will say metal gear solid

1263
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:05,840
ground zeroes definitely did not feel like enough meat for what i paid for it that well it's that's

1264
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,880
funny because like that game really is incredibly complex and has a lot of tons of details like in

1265
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:15,840
this one level it is one level game and it takes like an hour to beat but then you can replay like

1266
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:20,800
collect shit so like that's an interesting question is it worth 60 definitely not which is

1267
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:25,280
why they almost immediately reduced the price because they were ashamed of themselves but yeah

1268
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:30,240
i think i did buy it for 60 by the way it was only 40 when it came out in defense oh really

1269
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:34,560
but it was not worth 40 bucks devu says he wants rpgs to become smaller and shorter and more about

1270
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,440
the details of a world than the scale of it he also insists that he's got a lot of length in him

1271
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,640
oh does that mean you have a big cock in you right now is that what you're trying to say to me

1272
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:52,080
yo that's gay dude that's gay i i for one like i can remember i can't unfortunately i can remember

1273
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,680
the last time i played paid 60 dollars for a game what i cannot remember is the last time

1274
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:03,440
that i paid 60 for a game and then played it before it was dramatically reduced in price so

1275
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:08,960
in other words i see no reason for me to ever buy a game at full price because there's no

1276
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:14,400
fucking chance i'm gonna play it before it goes down that sounds like a personal problem i feel i

1277
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:19,360
feel so like confused about i mean it's not like don't understand the question it's just hard to

1278
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:25,520
think about price and enjoyability of a game based on the length at the same time you know i uh uh

1279
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:30,240
like we could do a whole podcast on this i agree but the guy's question was specifically uh like

1280
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:35,360
guys have any opinions on game length and i do have an opinion on it which isn't like a real

1281
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,760
criticism but it's that so this is another great great chance for me to shout out my favorite game

1282
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:44,320
of the year holo night which is a 10 out of 10 experience which with free dlc coming out on

1283
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:49,360
halloween after the first free dlc thing and the amazing thing about that game is it is 15

1284
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,880
fucking dollars and it's on steam it's going to be on switch at some point soon i'm just

1285
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,600
shouting all this because everyone should play holo night it's fucking incredible i do plan

1286
01:54:55,600 --> 01:55:01,040
to playing it very soon excellent uh and like that game is it's a big metroidvania and it's got

1287
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:05,040
lots of content just like if you want to beat it through the first time but it's got it's got

1288
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:11,360
that classic thing i love about old uh metroidvania like uh egovania is what i was looking for where

1289
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:16,080
it's got like true ending shit and all these secrets you can find that like add to the to the

1290
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:21,440
gameplay styles you can do and the riches of the world like it's got so much content packed in it

1291
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:27,840
for a $15 price tag that i think you can make some sort of relatively objective standard for like

1292
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:33,280
amount of content available and quality of content versus price of the game based on that

1293
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:38,880
i definitely think that judgment can be made um like i i totally understand people saying like

1294
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:45,840
i'm not going to pay $60 for a five hour game um but for me it's like i won't do either one like i

1295
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,880
will not pay $60 for a game period like i don't care if it has 10 000 hours in it because i won't

1296
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:57,600
play a game that's more than 15 hours long like or 20 hours or so like um like devu says in the

1297
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:02,000
comments uh a story based game i want the length to reflect the narrative mechanic centric game if

1298
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,680
i can't get at least 50 hours of fun from it i feel i've wasted not only my money but also my time

1299
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:12,320
there you go it's it's a mechanic centric game which is the only kind of game i play um i don't

1300
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:17,360
want it to last more than two days i want to explore the mechanic and then go cool i get it like i

1301
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:25,760
just played uh odin sphere um right which is five different narrative tracks and um you play as a

1302
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,640
different character in each of the five but you play through the same levels and i beat the first

1303
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:35,280
character's narrative in about eight hours and i felt satisfied and when i got to the second

1304
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,200
character and realized i had to play through the same levels i went oh well i beat the game like

1305
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:45,680
yeah right it's over i did it cool i only paid 30 for this because i waited years before buying it

1306
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:51,440
or however long it took before uh the price went down on this game right so you know i felt like

1307
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:57,360
uh i got what i wanted which was a video game to play for a couple days while listening to podcasts

1308
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:02,320
you know i love what devu's say i love how devu's framing this though because like yeah like people

1309
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:06,880
sometimes are annoyed at like rpg's being so long but that's just because you really are getting

1310
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:13,520
such a a large amount of specifically story being being and it's it's framed as such so uh well i mean

1311
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:20,000
a lot of the time it's that there's a lot of game between the story but parts that sort of padded

1312
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:26,400
out like in a bad in a bad rpg i mean you can beat a final passing seven in like 30 hours if you

1313
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:31,120
really hustle you can do that that's still a long time yeah i think that's all good that's why i never

1314
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:36,960
beat rpg's is because at some point there's usually a point around the middle of an rpg where it

1315
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:44,720
becomes more about the combat than the story um because essentially rpg games are too big for

1316
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:49,760
their stories most of the time we're like at some point it gets into the third act and we're like

1317
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:55,280
okay we know who the villain is we have to kind of get there and like that's when it gets a bit

1318
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,680
more repetitive the battles get longer there starts being more and more fighting that's where

1319
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,680
and that's where i'm like i don't care anymore at the end you've mastered the combat and you

1320
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:09,440
now are getting an excuse to use your mastery you've you you have to use it on a thousand enemies

1321
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:13,920
though i hear what you're saying i hear what you're saying it's not the amount of the combat that's

1322
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:19,360
the problem it's when the combat system isn't as fun as the amount of combat okay that's sure

1323
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:24,800
and something like super mario rpg where it's like timing based each battle can be really like skill

1324
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:30,800
based you can you can try hard and you can win and you can dodge all the damage and stuff but like

1325
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:37,200
in a in a generic bare bones like uh everyone's like a gay elf and the wizards and they go and

1326
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:44,320
we're anime characters uh and the combat is the worst thing of all time and it's the same length

1327
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:51,440
i hate it okay that's fair okay even if the story is one last question uh before we fucking head

1328
01:58:51,440 --> 01:59:00,000
out of here canith craley asks what type of content does youtube need more of um my answer to that is

1329
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:06,880
irreverent shit like what i want less of is like cultural commentating analysis

1330
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:12,640
reviews like or people just like responding to each other i want more stuff that's just

1331
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:20,160
creative and weird and funny and like that i won't get anywhere else you know we need uh more

1332
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:27,040
maximus thorns more maximus thorns a good example potion seller the guy who did that like uh or gmc

1333
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:32,720
foe show like stuff like that where it's just like you know the youtube channel has an identity

1334
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:38,880
it's one type of content but it's like something that is wholly unique to themselves and it's not

1335
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,680
beholden to trying to be popular on youtube it just is a good idea you know well you know in

1336
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:47,920
response to this specific question the answer might be uh nothing and youtube needs to die because

1337
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,720
it's getting too corporate and is not supportive of this kind of content uh i just think i'm thinking

1338
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:57,760
video content and yeah if you ask me what's the ideal situation we all end up skating from youtube

1339
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:03,200
and everyone becomes way weirder because the we're not trying to pursue algorithmic success anymore

1340
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:07,200
you know one of my favorite things about youtube is how you could like up to now you've been able

1341
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,960
to just say the word fuck and it didn't matter you could see it at any time in any video one of the

1342
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:18,720
greatest things about the entire fucking platform yep yep yep and now it is gone is gone yeah hashtag

1343
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:24,480
demonetized uh tom hippo you guys got hashtag explode i kind of agree with you digi i think

1344
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:29,200
there just needs to be more stuff on youtube and in the web in general that's less about trying to

1345
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:35,120
game the system to make money and to just make cool shit i think we had that for a while i think

1346
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:39,680
early youtube was all about that because there was no financial incentive in the mix at all

1347
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:43,840
you know and i remember that that's how i found m dot strange and all this and i think this stuff's

1348
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,800
fucking fantastic and it wasn't about make money it was just like cool crazy shit we need more just

1349
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,280
yeah just like esoteric bizarre out there just like i want to make this as i wanted to exist

1350
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:59,040
not because i want to make a paycheck yeah man now go to my patreon and give me money

1351
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,440
so i could do that um davoo says he needs more of the channels that he's been trying to catch up

1352
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:15,280
on to announce one year hiatus is well there you go yeah i was i was gonna say like if if youtube is

1353
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:21,440
only like the really good shit there will just be less it'll it'll it'll result in less people being

1354
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:26,560
able to make it on youtube but i think that would be better because uh some people just don't have

1355
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,120
any good ideas the field is a bit crowded now though i wonder if it would put us in a situation

1356
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:34,960
where the people on the top just stay there kind of like the uh you know like the the steven

1357
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,280
colbert channels and whatnot are just like cementing their place at like the top echelons

1358
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:44,560
what i think has right now what i expect to happen over the next few years if this kind of

1359
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:51,440
shit keeps happening is that gradually a lot of the youtubers on like the like several hundred

1360
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:58,880
thousand subs or even million sub levels will start vacating the site and all the you know all the

1361
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:04,880
industry shit will still be there but the audience wants those other guys like the audience is here

1362
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:10,400
for the homegrown youtube content once that shit leaves there's not going to be enough people watching

1363
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:15,760
the colbert shit on youtube gotta happen that's my hope too either it'll cause youtube to shrink

1364
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:22,720
and become just netflix 2.0 which at some point will just mean netflix will buy it and completely

1365
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:29,680
change it or like you know wait was there an or or they'll just die yeah that's the other i think

1366
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:33,440
they will become purely corporatized in time i think that's what they already work i mean they

1367
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:38,480
have youtube tv that's exactly what they're already on their way to do and for what it's worth i i don't

1368
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:44,320
even blame youtube entirely for this because like they're too big it was too good of a service for

1369
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:50,720
us i think like i think this idea of fully democratized content as beautiful as it was

1370
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:56,640
was doomed to fail because not like we don't have the server space for every fuck off to make videos

1371
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:01,760
you know yeah like in the world at this point we need this post scarcity society to come along

1372
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:07,040
and fix that but like it's interesting because like there's a new website uh bit shoot i don't

1373
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:12,320
know if anyone's heard of that site yet but it's not yet it's it's it's a new youtube competitor

1374
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:16,640
and it's peer to peer so it's all torrent based but it's you host your videos and then you like

1375
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:20,480
download torrents and that's how you so they they don't have any server space to worry about

1376
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,840
because it's all peer to peer i can easily see that being part of the the future you know like i can

1377
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:30,960
see that yeah i was talking about that in the comments or in the chat earlier about how the

1378
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,360
ethereum network i don't know if you guys know anything about that it's like a project right now

1379
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:39,920
that's like i i don't know much about it i want to do more research into it but i the general idea

1380
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:45,680
is that it's a peer to peer internet so the entire network basically is designed to replace the web

1381
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:49,840
as it is now and it's all decentralized and peer to peer so there's no central servers hosting

1382
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,880
anything thank god fascinating fascinating uh i can't come fast enough

1383
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:03,520
well i guess that's about it everybody yeah any other i think i think i think we're good so

1384
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:09,120
everybody uh remember most of those questions this time came from our private discord so please
