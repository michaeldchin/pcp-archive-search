Hello everyone and welcome back to a new post Radcon 4 episode of The Pro Crastinators

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,680
Podcast. I am the best guy ever. Oh by the way this episode, 203 love numbers. I'm the

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,680
best guy ever we got Gibbontake over here. Oh my god, Radcon 4. It feels like it didn't

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,880
take any time at all and basically it didn't even happen. It was so quick. I'm just the

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,960
video. Nothing has changed. I'm back in my seat. I'm just looking over and I have two

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
new pins. One of which is a Radcon 4 pin. How interesting. Tom Oliver is here. Don't you

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,440
love how we had that brief spike of interesting mix up content and now we're back to the same

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,040
four people who are always on the podcast. It's great. It's great that we're settled

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,360
back into our monotony of weekly output. We're back in all the wrong ways. Speaking of our

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,280
monotonous fourth individual, here's Ben St. everybody. Hey guys. Shit. Fuck you. I had

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,880
something I was going to say. No. Stop. We're not moving on until I remember what it was.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:19,080
Oh. Radcon. We're really fast. What? Life comes at you pretty fast. No. No. No. Sorry.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,200
We're going to take as long as we need. Something about how fast it went or going. You idiots.

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,480
You idiots said things about Radcon that were sort of related to what I was going to say.

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,000
I said that Radcon felt like it was going real fast and it's like basically nothing happened

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,440
at all. Is that what it? True. Oh, I was going to say because it was going to make the brilliant

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,960
observation that it's been like a really, it's actually been like three weeks since

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,640
we recorded a regular episode and it feels weird. Indeed. Yeah, because we didn't do

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,320
one last like two weeks ago and then the one before that was the one, the live one. Right.

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,640
Yeah. Weird. That's right. Weird and wacky. Well, we're glad to have you folks back and we've

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,200
got tales to tell and stories to divulge about Radcon, the content we made, the meetup, all

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,760
kinds of fun stuff. No, we don't. Yes, we do. We've got like, we've got stories. 7-Eleven.

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,520
7-Eleven was a cool thing. 7-Eleven. Radcon 4 sponsored by 7-Eleven. Radcon 4 was sponsored.

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,520
It was maintained by 7-Eleven. You know, I was really hoping we would see the return of world-famous

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,360
beloved character 9-Eleven and the Royal Rumble, but I hear he came down with that

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,440
coronavirus. Oh, yeah. Fucking 7-Eleven should have been in the Rumble. Coronavirus is hot

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,240
enough to melt steel beams. This is bullshit. Next time we got to bring back 9-Eleven and

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,720
his son, 7-Eleven, as a tag team duo. It's only two years younger. Hey, speaking of pins

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,520
that I mentioned before, I don't want to tell this tale. So we had the meetup and oh, you

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,840
know what? Oh, I want to say it, but something isn't out yet that needs to be out as a part.

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay, I'll just tell you what I can tell you, which is that at Radcon 4, the meetup on

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Pi Day, March 14th, it was a great time. We got images, show notes, look at all the people

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,840
who showed up. Oh, by the way, guys, I didn't show you yet, but Victor sent me the pictures

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,880
of the meetups and the OVA photo shoot calendar pics that they exist. So I'll get them to

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,080
you soon. Oh, and the big group shot of all of us at Radcon. Maybe I'll grab that shortly.

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,840
I was going to say about the meetup. It was a great time. People showed up. Not too many

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
people were spooked off by the virus, which was nice.

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,240
This was before. I'm sorry. I was going to say, it's funny. I feel like the coronavirus

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:52,840
thing went from spooky rumor to real shit pandemic while we were at Radcon. It's very

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,120
funny. Once we were there, we realized, oh, shit, things are getting real. Hippo, you

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
real possibility that you might not be allowed to fly home didn't end up happening.

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,280
I never felt like that was a possibility just because of why would they not let a foreign

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,640
person leave? That seems like anti-American. Well, the UK might have said no flights from

44
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,760
America or something. Maybe. I mean, I don't think... That's true. I guess I just wasn't

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,600
thinking that that was going to happen in the time frame. That had entered my thought,

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,520
but I was just like, even in the worst case scenario, Gible just stay with Digi for a while,

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
who lives right there and it'll all be fine and good. I'll do a bunch of weed and I'll be completely

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,160
destroyed as a man. That would have been so funny. Imagine how much weed you would inhale just

49
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,240
passing Digi on an average day at his home and his base. It would be nightmarish. But hey,

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
about the meetup, I just want to say that if you came, I'm sure you had a great time as we all

51
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,640
did. Part of the photo, go down the legacy. It was the first dedicated PCP meetup, I think,

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,600
not like a RFCK thing or any of that side stuff or a BronyCon one. This is for the PCP,

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Radcon specifically. And you people, if you didn't come, boy, oh boy, did you miss out,

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,440
because at the brilliant suggestion of Tom Oliver, we're produced, and there will be links to this,

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,280
the wonderful PCP pennies, the crypto currency, decentralized crypto punk currency,

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,120
that we gave out in real life to all attendees for free. And we're on the streets, they're going

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,000
to the moon. It's such a powerful cryptocurrency that it only exists in physical space. You can

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,320
only have physical points. I've been looking at the stock markets. The economy is tanking,

59
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,480
Ripple is way down, but PC pennies are picking up the slack.

60
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,280
Remaining stagnant at value of one pin per pin. You're just not fluctuating at all.

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,320
To go to Gibb's point, it's not so much a cryptocurrency as it is a cryptid currency.

62
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,200
They apparently exist out there, but the sightings are very slim.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
Please, click the link in the show, it's if you don't physically own one, you hack, who didn't

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,640
even come to Radcon meetup. Tom made the design, it's beautiful, it's real. I'm holding it in my

65
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,600
hands right now. It's next to my Radcon four pin, and we gave them weight for free to the people

66
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,760
who should have extras. Wait, before we move on, at the meetup, who was it? Who was it? I'm trying

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,360
to find the name of the guy. Ben Rodea. Ben Rodea came to the meetup and he had made a gigantic

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520
punk plush. Of course. The life size punk plush that I have on my chair right now,

69
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
she's doing like a cool like sitting down, like what are you looking at? Sort of pose.

70
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,480
Legendary. Legendary weight. It was unveiled right at the end of the meetup too. None of us

71
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,720
saw it coming, and then all of a sudden there was punk, life size. Yeah, he just ran to his

72
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,040
hotel room and got his. So cool. Let me say, friggin Eric was there, Dune Koon was there,

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,240
endorsing slavery, like the hero he is. Friggin Eric. Friggin who made the ride shot. Friggin

74
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Eric. Oh, oh, oh, right. The gunsmith. Gotcha. Gunman. And it was all kinds of kooky characters

75
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,600
that came to that place. It was great. It was such a wonderful experience. We were there for like

76
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,360
six hours walking around Virginia Beach. We hung out most of the day. Well, almost the evening,

77
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,560
I guess. And there will be, I'll make sure those images are left. Zen Uxtable came.

78
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,320
That's right. Zen was there for a day. He was involved in a little bit of RAD content,

79
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,480
which was cool. I won't say what, but it'll be out pretty, pretty darn soon.

80
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,400
There was, there was that, that Fern guy that I know, tangentially a little bit about from.

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
Oh yeah. But he wasn't there for RADCon. So fuck that guy.

82
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,480
I like, I like, while Zen was there, I was like, I was, I was asleep. I was like asleep the entire

83
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,480
time Zen was there. Well, I think because I had, oh, it's because I had stayed up the previous

84
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,440
night making my either, uh, I was doing, doing something for one. I think for the,

85
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,600
you, you were working on your board for the Christian lecture, while me and Jesse were

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,160
streaming. Right. Yeah. During the stream, I sat there trying to write shit on the board,

87
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,520
but like just getting distracted and not getting any work done. I did like 70% after the streaming

88
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,680
that entire week. Me, you and Jesse and Gib, we were all up all night, every night streaming

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,120
like badasses. It was sick. That's true. That's true. I was, um, actually the first couple nights

90
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,640
I was up for a long time every night, uh, in my bed reading one piece on my phone,

91
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,680
at which you ended up being a big waste of time because I didn't actually manage to quite, I'm

92
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,840
still like 30 chapters behind. So I didn't, I didn't catch up in time to get on the podcast,

93
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,440
but the, you still could any time. I probably will. Actually, I forgot about that. But yeah,

94
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm like, I'm almost, I'm almost caught up now. Word. Yeah. Word. There's so, there's so much

95
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,720
things that were recorded. It feels like because of the, the, the whole thing with, there was like

96
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,920
six, seven, six or seven lectures. And to do the lectures, people, we didn't like perfectly

97
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,080
figure out exactly everything before we arrived. I think most of us had most of the general idea,

98
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
but like so much time was spent finishing off notes, writing stuff on the board, and then doing

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,920
the lectures, like so many hours of the, the 10 days. You, that's true. You all, not you,

100
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,560
hippo, but you all fuckers. Why are your lectures so fucking long? I can't talk. I don't want them

101
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,520
to be. I can't talk for tonight. I can't talk for a while. I just, I'm just, I'm just so talented

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,120
that I can get, I'm so succinct that I can't make a lecture more than two hours, even if I try.

103
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,280
I thought the Christian would be longer than that, but it wasn't. Yeah. It served you well.

104
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,720
But it, yeah, we spent a lot of, we spent a lot of the time just in these fucking

105
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,640
unbelievably long lectures. It was like, especially towards the end.

106
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,760
Uh, you know, I haven't done the math, but I, we like either tied or slightly more lectures at

107
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,680
Radcon four than like any of our previous radcons. I can't quite, I mean, whatever. I'll do the math

108
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,600
later, but, uh, how much math is it? You just got to count to seven. Well, I just don't remember

109
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,200
is the issue. I guess it's not a math question. It's a simple remembrance question of how many

110
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,600
fucking things happened, but it doesn't matter. Uh, nonetheless, it was epic and the classroom theme

111
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,680
was, uh, was good and fair and it pervaded lots of the stuff. When we were coming up with scripts for

112
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,480
various of our productions, we were able to incorporate the, uh, the school PCPU theme

113
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,000
very well. So that memes really got legs. It's really, uh, it's really going places.

114
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,160
Um, it's good stuff. Uh, Radcon four, what do you guys think guys? Let's, let's take a vote.

115
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,240
Radcon four, based or cringe? I, I would say based, but I wanted it to be longer.

116
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,960
By the time it was over, I was like, damn, is that it? Let's address that real quick. Cause

117
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,600
okay, at Radcon three, like Ben showed up halfway through. So like we couldn't do lectures until

118
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,320
that point. It's so strange to me to think that I was not even there for like, I was only there for

119
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,080
like a little over five days or so. I don't know, but like, and Radcon four felt way faster. It did.

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,360
It really did. I think, I think it really came that comes down to like the, the first few days

121
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,720
we were hardcore filming really, you know, the, the OVA was a big project. Um, the, the, the, uh,

122
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,000
the day out, the, the meetup was a whole like day out. So it was like, and basically everything

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,120
else was like really strenuous, like constant work. And I don't know. It was, it was, it did

124
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
feel like constant work. Yeah. We felt like we were, we were really busy the whole time.

125
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,120
Like time flies when you're in, uh, when you're doing work, I guess. Yeah. Because we crammed

126
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,160
so many, we did like three lectures in one day at Radcon three, if I remember correctly, because

127
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,920
we were hitting the wall and we had to do it at three. Yeah. I think so. I don't remember. Well,

128
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
maybe, maybe it wasn't, maybe, maybe it wasn't three lectures at least two, least two. Yeah.

129
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,680
We were going pretty early into the morning at Radcon three. Yeah. We went like all night.

130
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh yeah. I think, I think in Radcon three it was like Tom's lecture followed by Nate's

131
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,920
Final Fantasy lecture was one of the days. Oh God, did we do both those the same day?

132
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,840
God, what a nightmare. Yeah. Yeah. We did two, we did two lectures, um, in a row this time too.

133
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,000
One of them was hippos and yours was reasonable. Hippos was mercifully shorted and it was already

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:55,520
out. Yeah. Go click the link. Uh, I, I don't think we need to release them that fast. I mean,

135
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,280
yeah, it's not super important. My, um, my Jennifer Diane writes lecture whose title I'm

136
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,960
still debating. I'm constantly going back and forth on what I want to title it, but, um,

137
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,680
it's almost ready. Just, uh, it's, it's basically all edited. I just have to like figure out some

138
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,960
like weird editing, or weird like rendering hiccups and that's basically ready to go. But like

139
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,320
the CWC one probably, I am probably not going to do that one for a little while. I will,

140
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,960
that's going to back burner that while I work on, um, finishing the slime and punishment finale.

141
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,040
Sure. Um, I don't know. I might just kind of, I don't know. The people want to hear that.

142
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,960
How many lectures, how many lectures can, are people going to watch in like,

143
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,600
are people going to watch a lecture every day? No. Uh, well that's fair. Maybe.

144
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,400
Some might, some might. I think given them like, uh, I don't know, two or three days,

145
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
like if like, I wasn't in control of releasing exactly what, I'd release one every maybe like

146
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,720
two days or something. I think that's enough time for the people who are the most interested to

147
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,240
consume and whatnot. God damn. The red con, I mean, we're, I, it was frustrating at the time,

148
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,440
but in hindsight, I feel like it was maybe a good thing that the content from rad con three

149
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,120
took so long to release and it was trickling out over the course of like a year plus.

150
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,800
That's not a terrible thing. It keeps people interested in, uh, the rad con cycle turning.

151
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,240
It took a full year for TBAP resurrection to come out and I don't really think it hurt anything

152
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,520
particularly. I don't think, I don't think so either. If anything, it kind of kept like interest

153
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,920
alive in, uh, rad con overall. Like imagine if they'd all come out in like, I don't know,

154
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,480
two weeks and then you had two dead years. Ten? Well, well, I mean, maybe if we had gotten the

155
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,360
content out faster, we would have thought about organizing rad con four sooner. Think about that.

156
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,160
That is true. That is true. I mean, I wasn't even thinking about it because I was so swamped with

157
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,560
the stuff we were still doing. So that's, that's fair. Yeah. Um, like this time probably we're

158
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,800
going to have like the OVA will probably take at least a few months, a couple months to come out

159
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,640
and the dojin will probably be after that. Probably. Or maybe they'll come out together. I don't know.

160
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,960
The music video, I don't think will take that long to get done, but we have some work to do

161
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,960
on it still. Yeah. The music video will be out less than a month probably, right? I would assume so.

162
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Probably. If we get all the song release stuff arranged, which shouldn't be too complicated.

163
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,440
Yeah. Yeah. Taste. Hey guys, what did you think of my first lecture? My first foray into talking

164
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,240
in front of people. Dude, it was good. It was good. It was a good lecture. It was good. I would, I,

165
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,400
I mean, it was the first very small like focus, although it was more, it had more like lower

166
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,480
than I expected it to. It went a little longer than I expected, which wasn't a problem. It makes

167
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,600
sense. This is a new territory of small, very specific lectures that we need more of. This

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,960
could be the future of lectures as we're out of gigantic big series that we could talk about for

169
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,640
four hours. We're not out of those. We're not out of those. I think it's good. It's a good precedent

170
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,680
to set though, because there's, I think we all have a lot more of those kinds of lectures in us

171
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,280
than the big four hour ones. Yeah. I was always debating for so long, like before, like,

172
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,280
do I even know enough about a big thing that I can talk about a whole big thing in a lecture?

173
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,840
And I guess I forgot about one thing that I could do next time.

174
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,800
So that that's a secret tease for the next year. Yeah, I'm not trying to imply that there aren't

175
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,960
any. It's just get your wallets out for Radcon five boys. Gibbs already ready to go. I guess next

176
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,400
time I'll I'll do that. I'll do that. Oh, Lillia one. But I really doubt it'll be like long.

177
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,120
His it's actually pretty. It's actually pretty quick to explain what his books are about.

178
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,440
They're pretty. They're sort of they're sort of devoid of interesting facets.

179
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Well, I mean, I am curious how successful like a half an hour lecture would be as an example.

180
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,440
You know, in the same style, probably probably I'm sure it would do fine. I'm sure it wouldn't

181
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:30,400
be a problem. Yeah. Yeah, certainly. Certainly. Yeah, I'm going to vote. Radcon four was cringe.

182
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,640
No. No. In what way? Sight your sources, explain your argument.

183
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,920
It was cringing that I had to wake up and do things. Oh, that's cringe.

184
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Yeah. Thank you. No, it was really cringe about Radcon four, our diet the entire week. It was

185
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,520
that's terrible. Some might argue that's based. No, no, it was. I feel like I feel like it was

186
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,320
better than than Radcon three, because three was almost entirely cereal and then fast food.

187
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,800
Well, that's true. The first half of Radcon three's diet was cringe. This this time we had bacon and

188
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,000
eggs, which is sort of bacon. It was a staple for survival. There was more. There was more alcohol

189
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,880
at this one. The second half of Radcon three, Nate's and Ben's parents brought us over like

190
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,480
real food. So the second half of Radcon three, definitely bring like Turkey or mashed potatoes

191
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,640
or something. Yeah, yeah, stew or something. There was a lot of like just like real food.

192
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah, it was good. And to the point where we didn't use like half the groceries we bought

193
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,680
the beginning of the week. That's true. That was pretty much nobody drank any fucking beer.

194
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,680
I was like the only one that drank beer. I don't even like drink beer usually, but like we were

195
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,960
there at Radcon. We had a big case of beer. I was like, well, I feel like it's in the spirit of the

196
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,040
event to be drinking this all the time. I don't much prefer beer hard liquor in any capacity.

197
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,040
If I ever choose between a shot of vodka and a beer, I'll take a shot of vodka

198
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,800
every time. 100%. A beer is pleasant. We were on vacation. I don't know why everybody didn't

199
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,960
constantly have a beer in their hand. It would have been funny. Because you had them all, Ben.

200
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,160
I would have if it was like brought up more. I wouldn't have had them all if other people

201
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,600
had been drinking them. This is a chicken and egg situation. It is. It is. Like the whole tiki bar

202
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,880
aspect, I don't think I was there for like coming up with that for the Kickstarter. So I wasn't like

203
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,560
thinking of this as like, oh, the alcohol Radcon. So I never really thought to do it until it was

204
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,080
a stream time. Well, you know, the first night, I definitely got significantly drunk. That was

205
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,520
the best night. That was the best night. That was the best night. It was the best night until

206
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,120
after the stream where I literally threw up in my sleep and woke up covered in puke. It was. Oh,

207
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,960
God, did that happen? That did happen. Oh, that's awful. Yeah, it was fucked up. I mean, I puke,

208
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,040
but famously, I deliberately strategically puked during the stream and it worked like a charm and

209
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,600
it was the best decision I ever made. I should have done what you did. I've never been that drunk

210
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,200
in my life and I never will again. I've learned my lesson. Law. Law. I've been way drunker than

211
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,440
that many times. As have I. As have I. But I've made a, what's the word, a conscientious objector

212
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,800
stance? It's morally wrong and no one should do it. It's immoral. Terrible. Terrible. Anyway.

213
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,400
No fun allowed in Nate's life. No fun allowed. And fucking, I'm disappointed. We had to leave

214
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,160
all the extra alcohol with Digi. So now he's got like half a handle of gin, half a handle of vodka,

215
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,040
and half a thing of like. Amazingly, the people may know as we were transporting those out of the

216
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,520
house, we like lost all the lids. Yeah. So these like open containers. I had to sit in the back.

217
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,800
I had to sit in the back of Jesse's car with these open liquor bottles, which I think is illegal.

218
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,760
That's illegal. That's definitely illegal, but I did it anyway, because fuck the Polis. I mean,

219
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,320
it's not illegal for you. I think it's illegal for Jesse, since he was driving. Oh yeah, true.

220
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
But whatever. Even if like they breathalyzed you and you had no blood alcohol. It's still illegal,

221
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,480
because I mean, you might just be, could theoretically be sipping a little bit or something,

222
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,520
and it's just a discourage, you know. I don't see why it would be illegal. Okay. I don't see why

223
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,080
it should be illegal to drive with open containers if you are like demonstrably not drunk.

224
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,440
You know, there have been times this has amused me when like, I remember when I was in college or

225
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,160
something, and my dad would pick me up from the airport, and dad would greet me in the car,

226
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,600
and he would have like a beer for me, and generally not to shit on my dad, but also like one for

227
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,720
himself. Oh, don't say that. Oh, don't fucking tell me that. That sucks. That fucking sucks.

228
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,880
It was like one though. It wasn't really that bad or that serious. That fucking sucks. It just is

229
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:05,280
technically illegal. Sucks. Which, you know, is amusing. Uh, dab, ACAM. Oh, dad. I mean,

230
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,800
that's one of the cool dad things that dad does sometimes. No, it's not. What? I think drunker

231
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,200
is not going to make you. It's not cool dad behavior. Do you explain why? Why is driving drunk

232
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,840
not cool? I don't know, Nate. Is one beer going to get our dad drunk, Ben? Is that the point?

233
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,960
I guess not. I guess not. All right. You shouldn't fuck, whatever. I'm not encouraging it, but if

234
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,080
you want to be cool, I'm just, you know. Nate, your sense of cool is like fucked, and it sucks.

235
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Okay. Well, luckily, everyone listens to me when I tell them what's cool and what's not.

236
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,960
Based, dad. Nate heads, consummate drunk drivers. What else is going on? Starts an epidemic

237
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,840
in the PCP audience. Nate has never drank except when driving. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

238
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,560
Dad's a better driver drunk than sober. He's actually more dangerous with without all boomers

239
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,480
are with it. I believe it's Joe Biden's main, main, you know, presidential criteria. Oh, yeah.

240
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,160
All those times that he like is confused and doesn't know what he's doing. Like that's when

241
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,120
he isn't drinking. They get him liquored up before like a debate. So he can like seem

242
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,800
coherent. It's very wise. Just long enough to ruin America. Yeah. Okay. What other highlights

243
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,800
we got here? What else went down? Let me look at my notes. Yeah, let's talk about the Animorphs

244
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,960
lecture. Now, okay. First of all, you released your Animorphs lecture. Everybody loved it. We

245
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,360
were there. It was great. Way better than I thought it was going to be. And first of all, on Twitter,

246
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,160
who was that I saw commenting on the fact that his creation had had this big lecture made about

247
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,120
it? Was it K.A. Applegate? It was not quite. It was her husband who co-wrote the books. He's

248
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,160
someone linked him the lecture and he saw it and liked it. What? Excuse me? Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Fucking excuse me, sir. And just now that I just retweeted, Catherine Applegate herself

250
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,360
responded with a heart emoji to the reverse. You've got to be shitting me. No way. It's made

251
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,840
it all the way to the top. It's funny because I was looking. You've got to be shitting me,

252
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,040
dude. No, bro. It just happened. It's real. Fucking ridiculous. How did she find out about it?

253
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,320
You'll link that tweet, dog. Link that tweet in the links. Yeah, someone sent a message to

254
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,000
her husband saying, hey, here's a lecture. Oh, my God. And it just went up the chain,

255
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,000
which is fucking insane. Catherine Applegate at K.A.A. author. Holy shit. Yo, this is

256
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,560
definitely hashtag Applegate happening right now. It's busted. The gates of heaven wide open.

257
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,440
Did she like retweet your lecture, maybe? I don't think it retweeted. I think she was just

258
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,040
responding to my comments saying like, hey, I did this thing. It's fucking lit. Why wouldn't

259
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,520
she do that? I don't know. Why wouldn't she do that? Because she can't sanction all of Tom's

260
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,680
ooze. I think because Nate was a raging misogynist throughout the entire video,

261
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,600
which people are mad about. You were a bigger misogynist than I'll ever be, Tom. Well,

262
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,480
endorsed everything I said. I did. And you loved it. I do not disavow. In fact, I avow. I avow it

263
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,280
off. I don't love bass, Tom. That is, that's so cool though. It's Applegate. Applegate herself

264
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,360
saw the lecture. Well, it's so weird because I was looking, I was uploading it and I was like,

265
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
I need to think of a title for this. It's like, what have people been like,

266
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,560
titling things for animorphs on YouTube? There's nothing. There's like, literally nothing. Like,

267
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,800
the top results are the number one result when you search for animorphs is someone just made a

268
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,080
video of the entire Nickelodeon series. There's one big video that's like four hours long and then

269
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,320
didn't someone have like a animorph sucks. They had like 4000 views on some channel. I thought

270
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,280
somebody had, I mean, that's small. There's like the only big project with animorphs is some guy

271
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,400
over the course of like seven years did like long reviews on every single book, but they didn't

272
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,160
ever seem to hit animorphs. Animorphs is one of those like early, well, I don't remember what time

273
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,920
period is like late nineties, early 2000s sort of thing. It's well, it's one of those things that

274
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,040
came up and was its big heyday before the internet, before people could post like DeviantArt things.

275
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,320
That's true. That's true. It reminds me of like, like, like certain video games from that era

276
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,840
where like one or two pieces of fan art, but if they were posted nowadays, there'd be a million

277
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,800
videos, a million pieces of fan art. That's true. The times have changed. Press B in the chat if you

278
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,680
want the mythical Victor Beast Wars lecture one day. Oh God. Beast. Yes. I'm not ironically want

279
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:48,480
this so bad. Actually, yeah, not a bad idea. I like Beast Wars. I just, I searched on YouTube for

280
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,200
Jennifer Diane writes and nothing. There is not, there is not, there's nothing. There's no video

281
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,240
that like has that in the title. Damn. Yeah. When it comes to like interesting,

282
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Kokoro Wish is probably a little more popular. When it comes to like interesting subject matter,

283
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,480
Vriska is not like that obscure. So I kind of like failed in that aspect, but you know,

284
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,360
I just don't know cool weird things that nobody knows about. No, there's nothing. You search

285
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,440
Kokoro Wish and there's a channel called Kokoro Wish that has 37 subscribers and that's it.

286
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay. There's a music video called Eternal Kokoro Wish. It has 185 views and that's

287
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
literally it. Ben, what do you think is the likelihood of you making this lecture about

288
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,200
Jennifer Diane writes and then that spawning a, what do you call it, a gold rush of people

289
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,000
making like a lectures and analysis of, you know, down the rabbit hole with this person.

290
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,080
Yeah. Wait, who would be doing that? Just people, just YouTubers would be like, oh,

291
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
what's Jennifer Diane writes? Oh, this gets lots of views. I'll make a million videos about it.

292
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,680
Wait, wait, wait. Oh my God. Funny, Nate, get ready. One of like the six, like a dozen results

293
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:13,840
down. One of the videos that comes up is actually Legacy of the Pony, part two from T-Bat Plays

294
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,560
titled Big Boobs Bad Webcomic. And I guess- Oh no, that's heinous. In the description, I linked

295
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,800
to the Jenny verse because I guess we talked about it. You must have talked about it. Yeah, yeah.

296
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,920
God, T-Bat Plays was- Back to live T-Bat Plays, guys. T-Bat Plays was peak content. I swear to

297
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,240
God, like this was the point. You would, if you had watched T-Bat Plays, you would already,

298
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,840
you wouldn't need the lecture. You would already- That's true. Ben, remember the intense controversy,

299
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,320
the T-Bat, we were almost closed our doors. We almost shattered our windows at this event,

300
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,480
where because we did 10 minute episodes, I insisted that we stop filming an episode

301
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,840
in the middle of a boss fight during Equestria Bound and we'll be back next time. And by this,

302
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,440
I mean, maybe like two or three people commented saying like, that was fucked up.

303
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,360
I do not remember that, but I'm sure- I'll never forget that day. Sounds very on brand, yeah.

304
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,760
It had to be done. I mean, hey, since K. Applegate is fully endorsing Tom and all his political

305
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,840
beliefs, I can't wait for Diane Rice to do it for Ben and for Vriska to do it for Giv. Jennifer is

306
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,200
online. She is on FIM Fiction. She's actively writing and commenting and stuff on FIM Fiction.

307
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,920
She has a YouTube channel. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she-

308
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,600
Yeah.

309
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,240
If she called for the lecture and maybe saw it.

310
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,120
You should do a like T-Bap, so it's like Friendship is Magic related, T-Bap transcript

311
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,040
of like Phantom Horn saying your entire lecture as a fanfic. And then she can comment on that.

312
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,800
Wait. So it's on fanfiction.net?

313
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:56,160
Okay. No, the entire fanfic is just like starts like scene, a tropical house. Phantom Horn walks

314
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,600
out in front of a whiteboard. Quote. And then it's just the like the full transcript of the lecture.

315
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:01,920
And-

316
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,440
Do it. Perfect.

317
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,760
Why not? Why not? That's so- I'm- you think Andrew Hussie will see the Vriska lecture?

318
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,360
I mean-

319
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,320
No.

320
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,400
No.

321
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,360
It's Andrew Hussie. He doesn't give a shit.

322
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,320
I mean he might see it, but like nobody knows anything he sees because he never does anything

323
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,680
online anymore. Like if he liked it, he won't click like. He'll just sort of like smile.

324
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,400
With his nasty fat lips.

325
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,080
You know, maybe he does a fat lips. Maybe he wouldn't appreciate a fellow Vriska connoisseur

326
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,680
in this particular unique format that makes the kids go Goo Goo Gaga because they are babies.

327
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,560
Babies enjoy the lectures is my point. Maybe this is like a kind of format that he would

328
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,040
like more.

329
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,280
Maybe.

330
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,840
My thinking about my choice of lectures is like, I know the people crave- they've been crying out

331
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,760
for CWC 102, right? Part two. That's- that's me like giving- that's me giving like the people

332
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,320
what they asked for. That's me like being like, okay, here's what the people expect of me,

333
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,280
here's what they want. I'll give it to them. To Jennifer Dayan Wright's lecture is me

334
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,720
exercising my artistic power to give people what they do not yet know that they want.

335
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,840
Of course.

336
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,320
Of course.

337
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,760
The- the- I feel like this- I feel like that one is super cool and interesting and people

338
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,600
who watch it and listen to it will be like, wow, that sure is fucking neat and I never would have

339
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,520
known any- I wouldn't have ever heard- ever heard of any of this stuff if not for this.

340
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,800
Because that was largely our reaction upon listening to the lecture.

341
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,040
That's- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was watching- I've watched it back like so many times because

342
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,960
I've been going through and editing it. I've-

343
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,680
Right, right.

344
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm sick of it.

345
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:59,280
Also, as a- as a treat, as a treat, I put in, um, okay, remember- remember in the lecture how I

346
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,800
mentioned that before she started making web comics, she made a thing called Kami Shibai,

347
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,560
which is like a little like interactive like-

348
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,880
Yep.

349
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,840
Like game. In- in the middle of the lecture, there's like a little 10-minute block in it

350
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,920
where I just play the Pastel Defender Heliotrope, um-

351
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,480
Sick.

352
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,440
Kami Shibai, uh, you know, from 1998, like six years before the comic started, uh, and it's-

353
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,480
it's actually kind of cool. It's got like- it's got like pretty hype anime chiptune music

354
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,840
that plays over it. Like, that's- that's like in the original thing. I don't know where she

355
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,720
got it from. I don't know who made it, but uh, it's- it's sick. And again, and that's like nowhere.

356
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,280
You can't see that anywhere unless you go and download the Kami Shibai and download the files

357
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
and play it in the thing, and nobody's gonna-

358
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,280
Was it hard to find?

359
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:51,840
Can do that. Yeah. Uh, I- I feel like it sort of feels like lost media, but I'm sort of recovering

360
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,160
a bit.

361
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
Good. Good.

362
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,560
Yeah.

363
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,400
That's kind of what I hope these things to be.

364
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,960
They're- I don't know, they're a little bit more than just a video. I mean, uh, you know,

365
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,560
a lot of it is like, uh, we were talking about, like, how long it takes to make notes. Like,

366
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,920
sure, it takes a couple hours to put together notes or whatever, but really it just takes,

367
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,160
like, a lifetime of dedication to, like, either a particular media or, like, some- some, like,

368
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,680
genre. Like, like, Gibbs proposed, like, a YouTube poop lecture that may or may not exist one day.

369
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,240
Something like that. And with all the, like, things that you wouldn't find scrolling through

370
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,800
the fucking Wikipedia article, you know, that you can bring to the forefront and make interesting to

371
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,680
people. That's- that's what I like about it so much.

372
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,360
The thing about the YouTube- I was considering that for a while. I think the thing about the

373
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,120
YouTube poop lecture is that it would make far more sense as a video where you can show examples

374
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,080
of things. Because if I'm just talking about, like, hundreds upon hundreds of different styles of

375
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
video editing, but I'm not doing video editing-

376
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,280
You could do it as a lecture. If you just, like, mentioned, like, it'd be almost like a political,

377
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,000
like, a military battle. Like, you describe what, like, X General did with his troops and how that,

378
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,280
like, changed the board over some span.

379
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Maybe. I feel like- I feel like the person who would do better at, like, making a YouTube poop

380
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,440
style, like, explanation is Emperor Lemon, because he's done stuff like that before,

381
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,360
and he was in, like, you know, the community at the time. He has more insight on-

382
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,800
You can even share a poops as well.

383
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,440
I- I mean, it's not about- I haven't made any, really, but, like, um, I don't know.

384
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,600
I feel like- I feel like it would require far more research in order to make a satisfying sort of

385
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,480
product.

386
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,000
Sure, sure. It's like how- all those guys who make those, like, fairly popular speedrunning videos,

387
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,400
generally they intersect with the story at some point, because they probably are speedrunners,

388
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,720
or were at some period of time, so they know this shit, uh, pretty in-depth.

389
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,920
That's been what I've noticed, anyway.

390
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,840
Hmm.

391
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,040
Hey, so-

392
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,240
I don't think of anything else.

393
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,600
Well, about- let's talk a little bit about the OVA and the fact that we all were anime girls

394
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,640
for a while there.

395
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,960
Oh, okay, sure.

396
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
Um, Lamau.

397
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,320
We could- we could, you know, if you guys want, we could, uh, perhaps provide some sort of hints,

398
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,480
perhaps of an image attached to this, or should we keep everything secretive?

399
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,560
I mean, well, that- that video already came out where, like, Ben and Munchie were in, like,

400
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,360
their costume.

401
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,240
It's true.

402
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,960
Not everyone was-

403
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
But that's just for backers, right?

404
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Oh, is that just for backers?

405
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,040
That was probably-

406
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,120
I thought that was-

407
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,080
Was that one public?

408
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,440
Okay, okay, but one grainy phone video with a couple of us is different from, like, revealing

409
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,600
a full spread shot of all of us.

410
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,120
So, I don't know, I don't know.

411
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,320
Well, I'm more like talking about, like, the experience of doing it,

412
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
because I had, like, a bit of a weird, like, thing.

413
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,040
I think everyone else was just sort of like, ha-ha, this is funny, and I was like, uh, uh, uh,

414
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,760
lol, um, um, I kind of like this, uh, and I had that, like, that one tweet about, like-

415
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:50,800
Right.

416
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,520
Like, going a little crazy, going a little, like, um, I don't like admitting that I-

417
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm wearing women's clothing and it's kind of cool.

418
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,640
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

419
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
That's it, that's all I wanted to say.

420
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,080
I don't really know how to elaborate on it, it's just sort of an interesting-

421
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,400
I mean, I don't know, we all enjoy doing weird, silly stuff sometimes.

422
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,040
Maybe it does mean you're gay, who knows.

423
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,840
Maybe it does.

424
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,600
Good luck on your quest.

425
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah, I guess this isn't-

426
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,040
This podcast isn't really the best place to explore ideas of that nature, because, uh, lol.

427
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
But it was just, it was just a thing.

428
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,040
It was, it was a thing, I don't know, why is Ben muted?

429
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,680
I thought Ben would have something to say, because he was the one wearing makeup.

430
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,360
Yeah, like a big gay, as the days do.

431
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,720
Man, remember, remember how Ben was constantly like, I gotta go fix my makeup guys, and then

432
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,680
we'd have to wait, like, 10 minutes.

433
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,480
Yeah, if there's fucking stop shots, well, Ben fixes goddamn makeup, it's really annoying.

434
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,840
And then you would go to get Ben, and then Ben would come back, and you'd be inside doing

435
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,360
something, and be like, oh god.

436
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,400
That was a running gag.

437
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,720
It was-

438
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,160
It was always a chimilin ski.

439
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, dead name, sorry.

440
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,600
Whoops, bleep that out, bleep that out.

441
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,520
It was always a teabag.

442
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,480
It was always a bestman.

443
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,480
Two best brothers delay production entirely.

444
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
How do we call, what is your fake brother name?

445
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,040
Is it, is it best saint?

446
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,360
We don't have a fake brother name, you can call us teabag, I guess.

447
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
It's standard, it's keg standard and substandard, that's canon.

448
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,040
That is true, that is true.

449
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
Jesus Christ.

450
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,960
That's the one name that unites fake fans, including the creators of characters, fake fans.

451
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,600
Disgusting.

452
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,920
Um, yeah, I mean, that, that whole production, I mean, none of it would, it's just that it

453
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
goes on for so long.

454
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,720
I mean, we filmed the OVA, and miraculously, we were, excuse me, able to get it done in

455
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,080
one day of filming.

456
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,160
And thank god for that, because we were dreading, like having to spend a second day, and probably

457
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,560
a large amount of the day, because we start things late, and because people are cowards

458
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,040
and weaklings.

459
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,160
Did you have to get up and come over?

460
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,080
Right, it's like a half an hour drive to the house.

461
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,360
You know, we should talk about, we should talk about the fucking dog, the dog that

462
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,440
tried to fuck up our, our shoot.

463
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
Sure, sure.

464
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,640
So while we were filming the music video, there, I won't describe in too much detail,

465
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,000
but at the, at the seminal shot, as like the lights are going down, the sun is setting,

466
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,680
and we're filming a very important dramatic shot for the music video, a fucking little

467
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,840
pug, it just walks into the frame, right where we're filming.

468
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,600
And okay, like, so some guys walk in his dog, and I think he had like two, there were two

469
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,800
ladies with him, I don't know if they were with him or whatever, and okay, that's fine.

470
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,240
They're there for a second, it's okay.

471
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,160
Okay, cut to like five minutes of this like teenage motherfucker, like lazily, slowly like

472
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,200
circling our group, like trying to get the dog, but really making just the least possible effort

473
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
to grab that fucking dog.

474
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,280
And I would have grabbed that dog, but I was indisposed and could not do it at the time.

475
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
And by the way, I love that dog.

476
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,880
He was cute and he was great, and I was happy to see him.

477
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,040
But nonetheless, we had a fucking job to do.

478
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,280
So this is not, not good timing.

479
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,960
And he was hard, I mean, he was a hard dog to catch, like I tried to grab it myself,

480
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,240
but he like skidded, scampered away like, like really fast.

481
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,440
But like the guy was just sort of, he was just sort of like amused and sort of standing and like,

482
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,000
what would you call it, like orbiter sort of did orbiter distance, better orbiter distance

483
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,040
around us.

484
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,120
Yeah, he was just kind of like watching with the used interest as all of us are freaks trying

485
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,760
to get this photo, like video thing done.

486
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,720
And he just made no effort to be like, hey, clear, you guys are in the middle of something.

487
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,160
Maybe I'll get my dog out of the way.

488
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
He's just kind of like standing there.

489
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
Dogs, am I right?

490
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,720
As it's like running around us.

491
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
If I can have a conversation with that man, maybe you can tell me why he is being such

492
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,760
a slow moving, uh, lackadaisical, because he doesn't know any of us.

493
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,880
He's too shy to come up and imagine your dog runs into a group of people,

494
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,720
not even clearly filming something, but just standing there and the dog is like fucking

495
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,000
with him and not fucking hustling at all to get that guy who jumped in.

496
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah, we're talking about the dog.

497
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah, fuck that guy.

498
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,320
Ben was really mad.

499
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,520
All of us were just like, haha.

500
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,480
Ben was the most mad.

501
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
But Ben, Ben was the most blatantly mad.

502
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,120
Like, like even when the guy was hanging around like, I'm gonna fucking kill that dog.

503
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm gonna fucking kill that dog.

504
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,680
I mean, I was, I was like a little amused and a little annoyed when the dog showed up.

505
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,760
But like after the dog was like running around, like for a while, like while and like the guy

506
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,400
is right there and he could easily pick his fucking dog up and get him out of there.

507
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
And we're clearly doing something and don't want the dog there.

508
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,040
And the sun is setting as we have like a tiny window, sliver of time to finish this.

509
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm like, oh god, we're gonna have to redo this entire shot tomorrow.

510
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
This dog doesn't get the fuck out of the way.

511
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Yeah, yeah.

512
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,680
Well, he got him eventually, which, you know, the least he could do.

513
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
Better late than never, I guess.

514
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,400
We will obliterate him.

515
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,360
I don't know what, I don't know what.

516
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,680
Okay.

517
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,480
Nobody else said anything.

518
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,880
Like everyone else, you all just made fun of me for being mad.

519
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,640
But like clearly it wasn't a problem.

520
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,120
I just did like the dog.

521
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,680
That's all.

522
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,120
I was just sure.

523
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,160
The dog was fine.

524
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
We really did not have any use for him.

525
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,080
But at the time, like we really did have, I mean, probably like, I don't know,

526
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,840
half an hour to get this shot done.

527
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
And we were, it was like the very last thing.

528
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,760
And you know, it did take the dog maybe like, maybe up to like three,

529
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,840
four minutes to like be removed.

530
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,120
So like that wasn't, it wasn't like an ad coming back.

531
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,480
I don't think it was longer than that.

532
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,200
Those minutes are.

533
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,240
It definitely was.

534
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,040
Well, he came back.

535
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,000
And like came back a few times.

536
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,360
He came back a second time.

537
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,320
And it was, he was in like the final like drone shot.

538
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
And we were just like, oh god, that might be the best take.

539
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,840
He's in the fucking drone shot.

540
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,880
That piece of shit.

541
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,560
I think we have a shot that he will not be in as our final shot.

542
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,680
But I remember Victor saying that one with the dog was the best shot.

543
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,400
So it's not a problem if the dog is in the drone.

544
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,120
No, it's not.

545
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,200
But it's just like, come on, man, come on.

546
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,800
Yeah.

547
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,680
Yeah, he's cute.

548
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
The dog was also there.

549
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,800
That's the end of it.

550
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,160
I have no problem with the dog.

551
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,640
Including a dog increases production value.

552
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,000
Fucking not controlling their dog.

553
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
It is a public area that we were doing that in.

554
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,600
You're supposed to have dogs on a leash.

555
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,480
She was not on a leash.

556
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,120
She was just running around.

557
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,960
And you're not supposed to film without a permit.

558
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,240
So who's the real criminal?

559
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,320
What do you mean you're not supposed to film without a permit?

560
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,800
That's Victor.

561
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,320
You're not supposed to film.

562
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,720
That's it.

563
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,680
You're just not allowed to record a public place.

564
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,160
Yeah, it's barely public.

565
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,120
It's right outside the house.

566
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,240
You know better than Victor?

567
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,320
I don't.

568
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,760
That can't possibly be true.

569
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,160
On a phone?

570
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,200
I mean, I don't know.

571
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,680
Maybe it was specifically using the drone.

572
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,440
But that person would be the drone.

573
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
That's the only thing it would be is the drone.

574
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,680
Well, I think he specifically said filming.

575
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,960
And then the drone was a separate issue.

576
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,600
I have no idea.

577
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,520
No, there's no way.

578
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,720
What if you just take your phone out and film?

579
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,920
I don't care at all.

580
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
But, you know, I would do it anyway.

581
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
I don't give a shit.

582
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,880
It's pretty funny.

583
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,800
To put a cap on the whole like me,

584
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,200
like Ben, you weren't here when I started talking about like the.

585
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,200
Sorry, I suddenly had to shit really bad.

586
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,720
Lol.

587
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,440
Of course.

588
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,160
But what happened?

589
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,280
I was talking about the wearing of the OVA female attire.

590
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,080
And you with the me with the.

591
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm just going to say it.

592
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,240
Fascination with the stuff.

593
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,040
I look the best.

594
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,080
I was the hottest girl.

595
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,880
That's not accurate.

596
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,040
That's not accurate.

597
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,400
Nate, you were the only one that even came close.

598
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,200
But I'm sorry.

599
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,160
You're second place.

600
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,640
You're second.

601
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,280
I see.

602
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,680
I see.

603
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,080
Nah, nah.

604
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,480
It was me.

605
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,520
It was me.

606
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:49,840
No.

607
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,320
La Ma.

608
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,360
This is shit.

609
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,720
And I am.

610
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,760
Everyone else was cringe.

611
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,480
And I was based.

612
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,680
I really.

613
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,120
It was really funny.

614
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,760
I had to ever like every ever after every couple shots.

615
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,320
I had to run inside and like redo my makeup.

616
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,200
We were talking about that.

617
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,400
It kept getting like we hated it.

618
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,520
It kept getting fucked up.

619
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,120
But it was worth it.

620
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,880
It was worth it.

621
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,680
Okay.

622
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,880
That's called commitment.

623
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,520
That's one word.

624
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,560
It was really funny.

625
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,760
Like like at various points where I wore like the punk costume.

626
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Where people regularly did not realize that I was me.

627
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,360
And thought Michelle was in the house.

628
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,440
What did you say?

629
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,320
Well, did you said that?

630
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,160
Like he would see you give out of the quarter of his eye and be like,

631
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,120
Oh, is that Michelle?

632
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,280
Hold on.

633
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,320
I never thought that.

634
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,200
No.

635
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,640
That would make me fucking gay.

636
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,240
Yeah.

637
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,760
We all know Ben's gaydar is not active.

638
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,280
Digi's totally is.

639
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,520
Digi's definitely way gayer than Ben.

640
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,120
Indeed.

641
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,720
Yes.

642
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,080
Anyway, wearing women's clothes is based.

643
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,680
And that's all I gotta say.

644
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,600
I just thought it was funny that like day one

645
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,280
Gibbs on stream and everyone's like, Oh my God, Gib cut his head.

646
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,840
That's Gib.

647
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,760
I didn't even recognize him next day.

648
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,120
Gib dressed up as pump.

649
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,840
Where's Gib?

650
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,200
Who's the girl in the stream?

651
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,800
You were just a ninja.

652
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,320
I decide half the time.

653
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,200
I think I decided that I think makeup is cool.

654
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,520
And I sort of wish I could wear it.

655
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,640
Not in like a I want to like wear lipstick and look like a girl way.

656
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,320
I just think it's like cool that you could like just like paint stuff on your face to

657
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,520
make you look a certain way.

658
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,280
You can just kind of like apply imagery to yourself and the way you look.

659
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,560
I think that's neat.

660
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,440
It is pretty bad.

661
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,720
Ben leveled up and it unlocked new avatar customization.

662
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,160
He's really yeah.

663
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,120
Yeah, basically.

664
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,560
Alas, it has been.

665
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,520
What's the word?

666
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Socialized as a feminine trait.

667
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,720
What can one do in this Western hegemony?

668
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,360
Why we got to abolish gender and then I can.

669
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,040
I don't know.

670
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,040
I can I can put I don't know what I put on my face.

671
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,520
I don't know.

672
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,760
Some just like I'll just probably come.

673
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,720
Probably come mostly would be the just draw some common there.

674
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,000
That's pretty manly.

675
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,240
Right.

676
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,000
That's like the manliest substance there is.

677
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,600
Here you go.

678
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,880
It comes straight from the man.

679
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,800
Yep.

680
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,520
Straight from the store.

681
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,720
Pure testosterone.

682
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,400
People will walk by and I'll be like, no, no, no, no.

683
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,280
It's my own cum.

684
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,240
You fucking fag.

685
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,120
That's what I'll say.

686
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,680
That's what I'll say.

687
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,400
I'll get arrested.

688
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,320
You know, here's something interesting I was thinking about.

689
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,920
Like when we were leaving the house,

690
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,440
I was like, we didn't get nearly attached to the location

691
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,320
as we did last time.

692
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,240
Because if I recall during ragcon three,

693
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,080
there were like multiple times when we were like,

694
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,520
oh, we got to do a fucking house tour.

695
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,600
We got to go through the entire house and like explore it

696
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,800
and like show it off in videos.

697
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,920
I don't think we did that for.

698
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,360
For this was way nicer for the first one.

699
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,560
It definitely was.

700
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,200
Right.

701
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,120
Country was like, whoa, didn't you do that like the first day

702
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,160
when you saw when weren't you running around filming the house

703
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,600
and like doing a tour of the house

704
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,840
and you found the like the bloody footprints

705
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,800
and smears and stuff?

706
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,040
I mean, I wasn't.

707
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,400
I don't know if we were recording that.

708
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,280
I think it was just happening.

709
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,360
I swear.

710
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,040
I swear someone was filming that.

711
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,560
It definitely got filmed in one of the videos or something.

712
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,800
But I mean, one of the things that I had in mind,

713
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,960
like I really wanted to do a house tour

714
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,680
of ragcon three house, the arena,

715
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,080
specifically because I was hoping someone would make

716
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,840
a quake stage using the map of the arena.

717
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,760
So that was my biggest motivation.

718
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,880
No one has done that.

719
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,720
But the challenge is still open.

720
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,240
Someone wants to do that.

721
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,160
Although I just don't want to wake the other day

722
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,800
to make room for doom eternal on my computer.

723
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,960
I mean, it's been two years since ragcon three.

724
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,240
I think if anyone were going to do that,

725
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,200
they would have done it by now.

726
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,760
It's true.

727
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,080
True.

728
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,400
Someone's just been working away this entire time.

729
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,600
Like he started day one.

730
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,920
He's still putting the finishing touches on everything.

731
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,560
Hey, maybe.

732
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,240
I just remembered that we forgot to put patches

733
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,080
from Dark Souls into the Royal Rumble.

734
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,720
Oh, we didn't put patches, did we?

735
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,480
That's pretty true.

736
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,760
That's pretty fringe.

737
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,600
The Royal Rumble was another event of note

738
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,960
that we used some, I don't know.

739
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,520
It was this election of memes was interesting

740
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,160
considering now we've really got a large pantheon

741
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,440
and not everybody can fit even in like the 40 man one.

742
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,720
Such amazing characters as Big Dig,

743
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,280
the Samurai Ning who made it in.

744
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,040
Everybody loves that guy.

745
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,200
God, did you know he's just so shit all the time?

746
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,560
Can we just, you know, so bullshit?

747
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,920
At least he now has purple hair girl who I actually like

748
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,560
and is a good design that is cool.

749
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,440
So that's one.

750
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,640
You got one Digi.

751
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,400
Your whole light novel cast of characters, they're all fine.

752
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,640
He said that character just is Sabrina.

753
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,560
Oh, that's right.

754
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,160
She's Sabrina from Pokemon.

755
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,440
Just Sabrina.

756
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,720
That's very true.

757
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
But to be fair, like every anime character

758
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,960
is just some shitty trope with a different hair color.

759
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,520
That's true.

760
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,400
So, you know.

761
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,680
That's pretty base, dude.

762
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,480
I love anime.

763
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,320
It's well done.

764
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,800
They save us the trouble of like having to like get to know

765
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,080
or understand the peculiarities of new characters.

766
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,360
Yeah, because you can just see someone.

767
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,120
Oh, I know what this person's deal is.

768
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,240
No worries.

769
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,840
Sick, dude.

770
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,320
I love...

771
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,240
I love that.

772
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,440
Modernity?

773
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,080
I don't know.

774
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,960
I don't even know what I'm supposed to complain about.

775
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,400
I love modernity.

776
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,320
Modernity, yeah.

777
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,280
So how do you think the Royal Rumble

778
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,960
stacked up to old eras?

779
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,800
Because we had a new champion this time.

780
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,360
We're not going to spoil who it is, right?

781
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,120
We can save it.

782
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,640
I mean, people could have watched it any time.

783
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,280
We're not going to...

784
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,240
Oh, wait, it's already out.

785
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,680
Yeah, we live streamed it.

786
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,880
Oh, I'm so fucking dumb.

787
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,520
Yeah.

788
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,400
Yeah, no.

789
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,280
The ending was hype.

790
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,000
I don't know if noise ninja winning...

791
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,400
I don't know if the HTB guy winning was as hype

792
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,680
as the arm retrieval arm.

793
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,320
The arm defeating...

794
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,720
No, the arm was way too hype.

795
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,240
Especially the pose at the end.

796
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,680
The pose at the end, yeah.

797
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,160
But we were...

798
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,120
It was hard to beat that.

799
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,440
Perfect.

800
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
At the end, we were all definitely rooting

801
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,880
for noise ninja at the end.

802
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,560
Especially since Brad...

803
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,320
It didn't look like he was going to win,

804
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,280
but he pulled it out.

805
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,120
Especially since up until that point,

806
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,960
I had kind of forgotten that Brad Garlinghouse

807
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,040
was in the Rumble and he came in right at the end.

808
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,120
He was the last guy.

809
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,400
He had a good chance.

810
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,280
Like the best part.

811
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,880
A really good chance of winning.

812
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,160
It's like, shit.

813
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,840
After all this time, Brad's going to come back

814
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,960
and destroy the channel once again.

815
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,720
I was terrified he was going to win.

816
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,960
How bad, how sad would that have been

817
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,200
if Brad didn't won the Rumble?

818
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,040
The optics would have been all wrong.

819
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,560
It would not have been good.

820
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,920
Yeah, I know.

821
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,560
Thank God.

822
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,760
No, no, it didn't happen.

823
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,520
I mean, I loved having him there for the lecture,

824
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,920
of course.

825
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,960
We all loved having him.

826
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,240
Absolutely.

827
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,160
Pleasure, Brad, come back any time.

828
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,680
But also, fuck you.

829
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,360
Oh, wait.

830
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,320
Chemonically.

831
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,680
Is he even alive anymore?

832
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,160
I don't know.

833
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,280
Oh, shoot.

834
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,160
Yeah, he's alive.

835
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,960
Oh, sure.

836
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,680
Chemonically.

837
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,640
A ripple tanked and he committed suicide.

838
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,600
In some sense.

839
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,000
He must live.

840
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,040
He's got to live.

841
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,400
There must always be a Brad Garlinghouse.

842
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,640
A Garlinghouse is chained in the basement of my Garlinghouse,

843
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,800
and that's where he'll stay for all time.

844
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,280
It's like the Santa Claus.

845
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,920
Like if you kill Brad Garlinghouse,

846
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,000
you become the new Brad Garlinghouse,

847
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,080
and you start finding garlic in your pockets.

848
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,880
And you get your bank account and just skyrocket.

849
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,280
It goes to the moon, in a word, in a phrase.

850
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,680
We've got to do Redcon right now.

851
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,280
We've got to do Redcon again.

852
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,200
Redcon 5 to the moon.

853
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,640
It's in space.

854
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,440
It's on the moon.

855
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,240
We do it on the top of up.

856
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,800
It just feels like we were working the whole time.

857
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,480
We didn't really hang out enough.

858
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,760
We didn't stream.

859
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,760
There wasn't enough casual streaming just to be cool.

860
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,040
I do think of enough.

861
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,560
I do think the reason why it felt that...

862
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,360
Yeah, I don't feel like I got to hang out with everyone.

863
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,200
I don't feel like we hung out as much.

864
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,280
Even though I was there for less of Redcon 3,

865
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,920
I feel like I did more just hanging out.

866
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,440
Yeah.

867
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,160
And a lot of the time we were all spending

868
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,400
when we weren't doing a video or streaming

869
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
was typing up things for research notes

870
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,680
for the lectures we were all doing

871
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,880
and just looking at our phones.

872
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,520
It's like we're all scared about the coronavirus

873
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,560
and just looking at things like,

874
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,840
hey, do you know about this thing

875
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,400
that just happened in the coronavirus Twitter feed?

876
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,320
And it's like, yes, yes, we all know.

877
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,800
Lol, scared, cry, cry emoji.

878
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,680
I got to say, I looked like a real...

879
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,600
I didn't even walk on the beach enough times.

880
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,040
I wanted to do that more.

881
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah, that's important.

882
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,080
On the last day before we left,

883
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,640
I went out for one final walk up the beach

884
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
and I looked at one of those big weird pipes

885
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,840
sticking out of the sand and was like, hmm, bizarre.

886
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,960
Those are cool.

887
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,320
Speaking of the coronavirus,

888
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,760
I walked to Whole Foods today

889
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,160
and I looked like a fucking urban ninja

890
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,680
because I was wearing...

891
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,120
I was wearing like...

892
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,560
Well, when I went into Whole Foods,

893
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,600
I put on gloves and I wore a scarf over my face

894
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,760
because you're not supposed to breathe on stuff.

895
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,480
Right, right.

896
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,640
And nobody else was doing it

897
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
and I kind of started to feel stupid,

898
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,160
but I'm like, no, no, I'm right.

899
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,360
They're wrong.

900
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,880
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.

901
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,240
Yeah, that's true.

902
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Massachusetts is gonna get closed down soon

903
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,520
if they're not already doing it.

904
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,480
I was gonna ask, what's the status

905
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,480
of everybody's state or country or location?

906
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,960
Ohio just said they were locking down, right?

907
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,680
Like today?

908
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,360
I don't fucking listen to the news.

909
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,480
If you say so, okay.

910
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,960
Yeah, because my friend Ashley lives in Ohio

911
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,160
and she messaged me and was like,

912
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,560
yeah, they're locking it down until April 6th.

913
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,440
Wait, who does?

914
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,320
My friend Ashley.

915
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,280
Ohio, apparently.

916
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,160
Oh, yeah.

917
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,560
I have heard that they might lock down Massachusetts

918
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,720
or some part of it soon,

919
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,160
but they haven't done it yet.

920
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,640
I don't know.

921
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,040
Well, fair enough.

922
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,640
It's probably a good idea.

923
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,200
Honestly, I won't make a difference to me at all.

924
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,360
Because even if it's locked down,

925
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,400
even if it's locked down,

926
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,960
you're still allowed to go out and buy food.

927
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,480
Yeah, which is all I do.

928
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,960
That's the only reason I would leave my house anyway.

929
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,000
So like, whatever.

930
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,920
All this time, we were all preparing for our global pandemic.

931
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,360
Our lives were not pathetic.

932
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,480
We were just ahead of the curve.

933
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,840
It's a great time to be a neat, truly great time.

934
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,240
I'm the most patriotic guy around.

935
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,240
I'm doing my duty.

936
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,480
Yeah.

937
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,080
I love being a doom boy.

938
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,560
Doom Eternal is great and I love it.

939
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,080
I'm glad it exists.

940
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,800
And thank you, God, for making it for me.

941
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
It was really nice of you to do that.

942
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,680
God didn't make it.

943
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,880
This isn't a Christian game.

944
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,240
They made this a person who made this game.

945
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,440
Because you're going to kill God.

946
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,480
Or I don't know yet,

947
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,400
but you wouldn't go to heaven or something.

948
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,200
And I can't wait to kill God.

949
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,720
One of the tenants of Christianity

950
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,760
is that you kill God at the end.

951
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,960
You must kill God.

952
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,880
Well, they literally did that in Christianity, bro.

953
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,440
Remember that?

954
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,560
They did.

955
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,480
I mean, it sure was frowned upon, but it did happen.

956
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,840
They put them on a tree and they caught them.

957
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,320
They stabbed them in the chest.

958
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,840
They crucified them.

959
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,600
That's how it went down.

960
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:34,960
Pretty based.

961
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,080
Oh, I got nothing to say.

962
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,640
Doom is good.

963
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,440
Tom, I saw, of notes, just while we're on the subject,

964
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,800
I saw you saying, I think on Twitter,

965
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,200
that something about it didn't click as much for you.

966
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,920
What was that about?

967
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,800
Yeah, I'm not.

968
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,920
How do you, how so?

969
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,760
So far, I just beat the first boss, the doom hunters.

970
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,200
I just got to them this morning.

971
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,120
And I don't think I like it as much as 2016.

972
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,360
I think they went too far.

973
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,440
I think it's too frenetic.

974
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,120
I think it's too much.

975
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,680
I think the game has so many tools available to you.

976
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,880
I feel like it requires the precision of a mouse,

977
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,200
but it has so many functions and things to do

978
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,640
that it wants a gamepad for all the buttons you have to hit.

979
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,080
And I feel like there's so much going on in the game

980
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,720
that the first person perspective is a detriment.

981
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640
And if this game was developed as a new IP,

982
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,320
it would have been a third person shooter

983
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,080
because of the situational awareness

984
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,880
you need in order to play the game function well.

985
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,920
I do find myself scrambling to remember

986
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,440
all the buttons for weapons I have available on my, you know.

987
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
They're all, they're all like necessary,

988
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,600
like using the grenades necessary, using the flamethrower.

989
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,760
You got to use that flamethrower to get the armor.

990
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,040
You got to be bashing people.

991
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,600
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

992
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,520
So it's all, it's not like you can just like

993
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,360
settle into your favorite really.

994
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,720
You got to, you got to use every tool at your disposal.

995
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,000
And so for all those buttons, I'm like,

996
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,080
this is clearly designed for a gamepad.

997
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,760
But then like, because you have to hit certain sweet spots

998
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,520
on the enemies, it's like playing this with,

999
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
like dual analog aiming would be a nightmare.

1000
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,920
So it's like, you're trapped between two things.

1001
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,480
And yeah, I just feel like it's a lot.

1002
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,600
Is this compared to 2016 or classic due?

1003
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,080
2016, 2016 was like, was frenetic, but not nearly as much.

1004
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,160
Like they clearly dialed everything up to 11.

1005
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,400
And as much as I like a lot of the improvements,

1006
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,560
like the dashing and stuff is like really fucking sick.

1007
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,760
Yeah, I love that.

1008
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,800
It just feels like, I mean, I don't think it's a bad game.

1009
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,480
I still am having a lot of fun with it.

1010
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,480
I just liked 2016 more because it felt like more cohesive,

1011
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,160
I suppose, in terms, I never, I never felt like,

1012
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,960
I felt like exhausted at the end of a lot of the encounters

1013
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,360
in 2016, but never like overly so.

1014
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,960
Because like the Doom Hunter boss,

1015
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,800
because I don't know how far you are, you're in.

1016
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,640
I fought them, yeah, at least to that point.

1017
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,600
It just takes too long, because like.

1018
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,240
You got to switch between your fucking energy beam

1019
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,560
and then you got to go to like rockets to blast the bottom

1020
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,680
and then the shields back up.

1021
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,600
And I'm out of energy bullets now,

1022
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,440
so we got to go chainsaw people to get back,

1023
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,120
you know, ammo and everything.

1024
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,400
It's a lot, it's a lot.

1025
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,120
The intensity is like always at an 11.

1026
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,400
And I'm fine with that, but like it goes on for too long.

1027
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,080
Like it just becomes monotonous,

1028
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,160
because like the boss, you're fighting him

1029
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,760
and you're like, all right, I'm almost done with the boss.

1030
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,240
And they're like, oh no, he has multiple life bars, fuck.

1031
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
So you're still going and then like you kill him,

1032
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,280
you're like, all right, I did it.

1033
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,840
And then you drop down the hole, now there's two of them.

1034
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,880
And it's just like too much, too much, too much.

1035
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,120
Like if this encounter came later, fine.

1036
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,680
But like putting them back to back, like no, no, no.

1037
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,400
Like you're firing on all cylinders for too long,

1038
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,760
pacing, very important.

1039
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,480
I see your point.

1040
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,840
I don't know if I quite agree,

1041
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,480
but I certainly do feel like my fingers are stretched

1042
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,600
to the limit.

1043
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,480
And it is a lot to keep track of at any given point.

1044
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,720
Okay, anyway, anyway, there's your little doom review,

1045
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,760
doom eternal.

1046
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,800
I'm very excited to play more though.

1047
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,840
And I can't wait to go back.

1048
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,720
I'm definitely going to finish.

1049
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,160
Yeah, no, no, I'm actually,

1050
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,960
I didn't do this in DOOM 2016, because I, oh my God,

1051
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,440
I played that on Switch, Jesus Christ.

1052
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,200
What a fucking retard I was.

1053
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,520
But I have this one on PC, thank God.

1054
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,000
And I mean, I'm actually really excited.

1055
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,760
The first perks I got were like,

1056
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,880
where all items are on the map and like how to,

1057
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,080
like what items they are.

1058
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,680
So now I, after I beat a level,

1059
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,320
I'll immediately go back and get all the secrets I missed.

1060
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,360
Oh, it's so much fun.

1061
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,480
Oh, I really like it.

1062
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,520
Really, really good game.

1063
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,240
I should do that with 2016 as well.

1064
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,520
I should play it again.

1065
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,600
Okay, anyway, anyway, enough of that.

1066
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,120
Did anybody get Animal Crossing?

1067
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,080
Just out of curiosity,

1068
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
because this is the other one everybody's talking about.

1069
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,880
I've never been, I've never been a big Animal Crossing guy.

1070
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,600
I played one Animal Crossing on like the DS,

1071
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,720
I think for a bit.

1072
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,000
I played that game a ton on the DS.

1073
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,480
Wild World?

1074
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,240
Maybe we were playing the same copy.

1075
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,240
No, Wild World was the three DS.

1076
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,040
What?

1077
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,320
I thought that was the DS one.

1078
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,600
Oh, okay.

1079
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,760
I thought New Leaf was the three DS one, right?

1080
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,320
Oh, you know, maybe you're, hang on,

1081
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,760
fucking DS, Animal Crossing.

1082
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,200
Cometers, let me know if I'm based a cringe on this.

1083
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,400
Okay, you are correct.

1084
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,520
It was Wild World, okay.

1085
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,960
Hell yeah.

1086
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,240
That's the one I played a ton.

1087
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,960
But I want to get it,

1088
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,000
but I think I will lose time and efficiency if I own it.

1089
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,520
So I'm being a responsible adult and not buying it,

1090
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,960
even though it does look pretty fun,

1091
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,120
because now you can like customize your town

1092
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,080
and you can like actually shape the terrain and the geography.

1093
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,960
Something I've always wanted to do in Animal Crossing,

1094
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,640
but I'll be a good boy.

1095
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,880
Oh, plus we're on a tropical island, which is-

1096
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,600
It's on brand.

1097
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,320
Radcon, for Paradise Anybody.

1098
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:39,920
Do you get it?

1099
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,080
Mm-hmm, I see where you're going.

1100
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,360
I'm picking up what you're putting down here.

1101
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,040
Oh, it's fun.

1102
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,440
They're cool games, but whatever.

1103
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
Oh my God, guys, are you like shipping?

1104
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,400
Like I am like Doom Guy with Isabelle,

1105
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,760
because like their game's like same day, bro?

1106
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,440
What if different game, but same day,

1107
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,360
characters had sex?

1108
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,320
What if?

1109
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,920
Are people doing it?

1110
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,000
She's just a dog.

1111
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,920
She's just a small dog.

1112
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,680
You can't have sex with a small dog.

1113
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,960
I've seen a lot of fans on 4chan.

1114
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,080
Well, you're on 4chan.

1115
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,600
That's your first bra.

1116
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,320
Bro, but the deep lore is that the fucking-

1117
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
The Doom Guy had a pet bunny.

1118
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,280
I know Isabelle is a chow-chow, but it doesn't matter.

1119
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,320
Small cute animal that he loved, and then it died or something,

1120
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,960
and that's what made him so mad, among other things.

1121
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,000
So it's like he has a history of loving cute little animals.

1122
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,360
So he could definitely be shipped with Isabelle by me,

1123
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,040
and it would be totally legit.

1124
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,280
It's based.

1125
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,000
I know this is what people want and are dying to hear about,

1126
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,600
so you're welcome, bro.

1127
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,640
I'm keeping you up to date.

1128
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,200
Yeah, yeah.

1129
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,280
Okay, video game talk over.

1130
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,600
Ooh, finally.

1131
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,400
What else is going on in the world?

1132
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,280
How about the corona?

1133
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,960
We can talk about the corona a little bit.

1134
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,640
I feel like I talked about that.

1135
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,520
We're going to get demonetized.

1136
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,400
I guess you're right.

1137
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,720
You're literally not around talking about the outfit.

1138
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,080
I've got something that I've just sort of realized,

1139
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,640
which is going to bring the mood down.

1140
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,280
I might die.

1141
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,640
I might be going to die.

1142
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,480
But on the plane ride home, I was feeling kind of cramped,

1143
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,960
and then when I got home, I had diarrhea and a fever,

1144
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,480
and I was like, ah, shit.

1145
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,160
Of all the things to get,

1146
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,800
it was something that wasn't the coronavirus,

1147
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,840
but still hurts a lot.

1148
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,160
I'm looking up the thing,

1149
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:32,320
because Digi just said symptoms of that do arise with coronavirus.

1150
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,440
And I looked it up.

1151
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,160
Apparently, it's less likely, but it does happen.

1152
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,040
So I might have had the coronavirus this whole time.

1153
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,800
It's possible.

1154
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,920
I mean, we were saying before,

1155
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,160
I was feeling a little under the weather.

1156
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,360
I skipped my last two streams,

1157
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,040
because I haven't felt great the last couple of days.

1158
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,920
Like, sure.

1159
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,360
Theoretically, it's possible.

1160
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,600
If you came to the meetup and you talk to me, I'm sorry.

1161
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,040
I mean, maybe they infected you.

1162
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,200
They should apologize to you, Gib.

1163
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,280
I mean, it's possible, I suppose.

1164
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,000
But you can never be sure of these things.

1165
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,560
I'm just going to say whoops in case.

1166
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,960
But it also says there's a higher mortality rate

1167
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,920
for people who have the diarrhea alongside

1168
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,000
and it also says that you could have the diarrhea,

1169
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,480
but without the coughing, which is why I didn't think I had it.

1170
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,320
So I haven't been coughing at all.

1171
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,160
I should probably fucking get myself tested.

1172
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,040
You know, the funny thing about the testing,

1173
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,640
when I just didn't feel great, I was like,

1174
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,840
I guess I'll just go to the doctor and get tested or whatever.

1175
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,240
You can't, because there's not enough testing.

1176
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,000
It's only for medical personnel.

1177
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,600
And I think it was like people confirmed to have it.

1178
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,720
Okay, well, that doesn't make sense.

1179
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,080
Why would they test if they know they have it?

1180
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:44,560
I don't know.

1181
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,680
It was very limited.

1182
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,280
It might have been government officials or something.

1183
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,440
For me, I assume it's going to be a waiting list sort of deal.

1184
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,480
You press 111 on your phone right now in the UK,

1185
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,640
and you get the coronavirus hotline.

1186
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,200
Get Munchie's voice in the door.

1187
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,360
Do you have coronavirus?

1188
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,880
And I say yes.

1189
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,440
As he does.

1190
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:06,800
Yes.

1191
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,000
And say, okay, go to bed and stay there.

1192
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,080
Maybe I should do like an I'm dying stream,

1193
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,160
where I just play a branching clank or something.

1194
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,160
Because I don't expect to be able to get into a hospital at this point.

1195
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,760
There's so many fucking people already with the thing.

1196
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,120
The webcam's just going to go up.

1197
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,760
You in bed wrapped up in blankets.

1198
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,280
We'll just clarify.

1199
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,240
I should definitely try to get a test.

1200
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,920
And if I can't, then I'll try to rest it off.

1201
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,200
Because I assumed the diary had stopped.

1202
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,000
It was all fine.

1203
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,720
It was just a little bit of stomach bug.

1204
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,600
Yeah.

1205
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,120
But I'm not perfectly fine.

1206
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,320
So it could be like the beginning signs of having the coronavirus,

1207
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,600
or my start coughing soon.

1208
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,520
We'll just clarify.

1209
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,600
If this is the beginning of my death.

1210
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,760
Well, I can be ignorant about this.

1211
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,080
I think I know the gist though, or at least some of the facts,

1212
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,480
that like, I mean, you don't feel deathly ill,

1213
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,280
as I understand it.

1214
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,560
You're just concerned that you may have this specific illness.

1215
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,520
I have like a very vague headache.

1216
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,120
Almost no chance that you'd be seriously hurt by it.

1217
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,840
Well, I mean, when I was like in my massive pain,

1218
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,680
like when I came back and I had the diarrhea,

1219
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,280
and it was like fever,

1220
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,880
I couldn't really eat anything,

1221
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,320
otherwise I'd vomit it up.

1222
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,680
And I couldn't really, you know,

1223
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,000
it was just sort of like, couldn't retain water.

1224
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,720
It was very painful.

1225
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,760
Okay, sure, sure.

1226
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,560
I was in bed for an entire day and a half,

1227
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,840
and I couldn't sleep.

1228
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,640
So if that happens again, that will be bad.

1229
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,760
That's not good, okay.

1230
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,800
That's not good.

1231
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:41,200
So I assume I'm over the worst of it,

1232
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,920
because, you know, I'm like 26.

1233
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,440
I'm not likely to have a, you know, massive thing.

1234
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,960
But I don't know how this thing propagates.

1235
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,000
Does it come in waves?

1236
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,680
Maybe it does.

1237
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,440
No, I'm not really sure.

1238
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,160
Like, can I feel better and then feel worse later?

1239
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:58,800
I'm not sure.

1240
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,400
I mean, it's probably possible,

1241
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,120
because like, if you're like something happened

1242
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,920
and like your immune system got worse for some reason,

1243
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,640
and it got a second foothold on, I don't know,

1244
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,520
your body fights it off.

1245
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,840
And like, if you're healthy, most of the,

1246
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,360
if you're not ancient and you're healthy-ish,

1247
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,880
most of the time your body fights it off in your esophagus

1248
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,640
before it gets to your lungs.

1249
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,280
And then you're, and that's when you have mild.

1250
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,520
You get bad coronavirus if it gets to your lungs.

1251
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,800
That's the confusing thing.

1252
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,080
That's the confusing thing, though,

1253
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,800
is like, if it's going to my intestines instead,

1254
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,080
like, could it then...

1255
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,160
Well, it wouldn't be the virus.

1256
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,640
It's not, the virus is not in your intestines.

1257
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,600
It would be, I don't know,

1258
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,240
some kind of secondary bodily response.

1259
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,000
In your butthole, just hanging out,

1260
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,800
converting poop to diarrhea as it passes through.

1261
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,640
It's a tricky one.

1262
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,240
Maybe I sat on a virus and fisted to dildo it,

1263
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,920
and that's what caused it.

1264
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,160
Well...

1265
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,640
I heard one fact that,

1266
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean, I don't forget where I heard this,

1267
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,240
but I heard, I'm hearing so many of these things

1268
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,440
that may or may not be true.

1269
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,600
I've heard that like, 99% of people,

1270
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,120
I believe who died,

1271
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,840
only died because they had a second,

1272
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,440
like, debilitating illness

1273
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,720
that made them particularly vulnerable to the corona.

1274
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,240
I mean, usually, yeah.

1275
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:14,720
Usually, yeah.

1276
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,320
Like, it's not necessarily the case.

1277
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,360
That's true, it's 99% it's not 100%.

1278
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,480
It's not guaranteed.

1279
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,720
You can have, I think there have been cases

1280
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,880
of like someone with, like, a young, healthy person

1281
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,800
with no underlying issues can like,

1282
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,960
just get real unlucky,

1283
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,800
and like, they'll go to fucking critical condition,

1284
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,000
because like, it gets in their lungs

1285
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,120
and it fucks them up and they can't breathe

1286
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,560
and they need to be respirated or they die.

1287
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,320
It's, be afraid, people.

1288
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,200
Be afraid.

1289
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,960
Yeah, I'd run it in the sight of being afraid.

1290
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,280
Yeah.

1291
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:42,960
Well, yeah, I mean, if you feel bad.

1292
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,200
I'm gonna deal with that as soon as we're done here.

1293
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,480
Yep, that seems like the right thing to do.

1294
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,640
And I would encourage anybody who feels similar to Gabe,

1295
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,240
if you feel, you know, this level of bad,

1296
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,080
if you just got a little cold, I'm sure you're fine.

1297
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,080
But if you got, you know, any of the symptoms he's saying,

1298
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,920
that's, you know, reasonable to get that kicked out.

1299
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,280
Something to consider,

1300
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,080
because I, like, a couple days ago, I Googled,

1301
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,920
like, what are the symptoms of corona again?

1302
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,160
Oh, respiratory problems, cough.

1303
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,200
Okay, I don't have that.

1304
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,960
Fever, cough, trouble breathing.

1305
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,120
Yeah.

1306
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,640
If you don't have that, it's probably not coronavirus.

1307
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,920
But I do have the fever.

1308
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,640
And so with this, like, diarrhea thing,

1309
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,680
it's like, that's linked.

1310
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,560
If all you have is a fever.

1311
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,160
There's probable cause.

1312
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,640
There's probable, what's the word, to, like,

1313
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,320
there's reason to suspect.

1314
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,720
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

1315
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,080
If all you have is a fever,

1316
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,920
it's way more likely to be something else.

1317
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,240
Like, there's plenty of things,

1318
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,640
there's plenty of more common things that cause fever.

1319
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,440
Like a cold or a flu.

1320
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,040
Maybe, but like, not many fever things cause diarrhea.

1321
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,120
I'm just saying, I just looked this up.

1322
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,320
Do they?

1323
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,160
Yeah, sure.

1324
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,960
Yeah, plenty of, you can definitely get diarrhea

1325
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,640
when you just have a cold or a flu.

1326
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,680
The virus does not, like, directly cause that.

1327
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,440
The virus is in your lungs.

1328
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,320
So if, if you don't have, like, breathing problems,

1329
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,440
I mean, it's probably not coronavirus.

1330
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,680
Most likely, I mean, it could be anything's possible.

1331
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,680
I'll, I'll check it,

1332
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,480
cause I'm, I'm all spooked by this new knowledge,

1333
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,040
but whatever.

1334
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,720
Okay, I'm, you're, it doesn't sound like

1335
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,160
it's likely to be coronavirus.

1336
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,800
If it was something significantly worse.

1337
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,160
Who knows?

1338
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,720
Sure.

1339
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,440
Yeah, definitely.

1340
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:21,920
Right.

1341
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,400
Oh, it's way more likely to be something much worse.

1342
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,080
It's, what could it be?

1343
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,160
At least it's not, at least it's not,

1344
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,200
if it's something worse,

1345
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,200
at least I won't kill my family with it.

1346
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,320
That's the whole thing.

1347
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:33,840
Oh, no.

1348
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,040
Oh, you will.

1349
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,520
Oh, no.

1350
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,400
It's way more, whatever it is.

1351
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,200
You will kill them,

1352
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,480
but it won't be related to the virus.

1353
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
You're just going to get mad, you've got chainsaw,

1354
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,720
and just fucking massacre them all.

1355
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,480
Maybe I got coronavirus too.

1356
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,080
And I'm going to propagate vans from the UK.

1357
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,440
The coronavirus too comes out.

1358
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,320
You got the HD reaster of coronavirus, you know?

1359
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,480
Yeah, it's like it's bigger,

1360
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,840
better, and stronger too.

1361
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,640
It's the second member of the coronavirus crew.

1362
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,560
COVID.

1363
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,160
COVID-19.

1364
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:04,880
COVID-19.

1365
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,000
No, COVID-20.

1366
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,120
And then COVID-21,

1367
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,400
and then Goku comes back,

1368
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,040
and he's like,

1369
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,320
I'm not going to die anymore,

1370
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,680
and he punches the virus.

1371
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,320
Damn.

1372
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:12,800
Remember that?

1373
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,160
Remember Dragon Ball?

1374
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,400
I do remember Dragon Ball.

1375
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,240
Epic.

1376
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,080
Hey, me too.

1377
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,440
Well, I mean, if you guys want,

1378
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,720
I've got the voicemails,

1379
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,800
but if you've got anything else you want to talk about,

1380
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,280
feel free.

1381
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,440
Have we given the people their money's worth yet?

1382
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:30,960
I mean, it's over an hour.

1383
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,160
We're only an hour and 10 minutes.

1384
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,760
I feel like it's been three weeks

1385
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,760
since we had a fucking episode.

1386
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,480
Yeah, let me look up the list of things

1387
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,680
that happened during Ritecoin

1388
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,200
if there's something we didn't talk about.

1389
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,360
Did you keep a journal or a list?

1390
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,200
I kept a little gay journal, you know?

1391
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,600
Hey, you know, I'll let you look that up.

1392
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,200
I'll give people one interesting fact

1393
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,040
that I just think is fun.

1394
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,560
So while we were at Radcon,

1395
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,920
we've been talking about like,

1396
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,920
so the reality of Radcon is that like,

1397
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,680
we got like $34,000 or whatever,

1398
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,080
but much of that we knew would be absorbed.

1399
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,480
Like a minimum of $10,000,

1400
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,320
and that's before all the additional stretch goals

1401
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,600
we promised in order to just to break even.

1402
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,800
So I mean, that seems like,

1403
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,960
okay, it's like $24,000 cleared.

1404
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,520
Great.

1405
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,240
But then also there's, you know, production stuff,

1406
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,600
various things that are also going to eat in that.

1407
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,320
Okay, cool.

1408
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,560
So what I did finally after Radcon was

1409
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,280
we've been documenting all of our expenses and stuff.

1410
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,440
And what I have now is a running spreadsheet

1411
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,720
that like every expense I can now plug into that thing.

1412
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,200
And at the bottom, what it has is it spits out

1413
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,360
like how much profit each of us is going to make off the top.

1414
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,280
And I'm not going to talk about how much it is,

1415
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,720
because that's private information.

1416
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,960
But it's fun for me to watch

1417
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
as every expense gets added to it,

1418
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,360
like how that number goes down.

1419
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,080
And we want to maximize our income, obviously.

1420
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,880
While delivering on each of the promises that we've made,

1421
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,920
because that's the agreement, of course.

1422
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,840
But it's a fun exercise of me, spreadsheet man,

1423
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,680
that's my superhero name,

1424
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,360
to be upkeeping that with all the expenses

1425
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,320
and being just really mad at all of you guys

1426
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,240
for daring to expense anything

1427
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,080
and not just giving money for free for no reason

1428
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,320
to all of us so that we can all make more money.

1429
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,600
It's very selfish of you guys.

1430
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,200
You know what I'm saying?

1431
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,400
Yeah.

1432
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:20,720
True.

1433
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,080
Guilty as charged.

1434
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,840
That's capitalism.

1435
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,600
I love making money is the point of that.

1436
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,360
Expensing things was so cool.

1437
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,280
It felt so cool every time I would go shopping

1438
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,560
and be like, uh-huh.

1439
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,680
Yeah, I'm spending all this money on groceries for the house.

1440
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,520
We actually have money to cover the things we need

1441
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,400
to make Radcom this time.

1442
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,480
Spending all this money on groceries at the house,

1443
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,160
put it on my tag.

1444
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,440
Put it on the expense account.

1445
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,560
Yeah, work will cover, yeah, on the expense account.

1446
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,680
It felt like a real jet set radio.

1447
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,840
If you know what I mean.

1448
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,280
It's fucking great.

1449
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
God, if we just, if we clear like a little-

1450
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,560
You bet we can't live like that.

1451
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,280
No, if only.

1452
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,760
If the PCB got vastly more successful.

1453
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,680
I mean, I just think about like those fucking guys,

1454
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,920
like Come Town and those other podcasts

1455
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,840
that make literally too much money.

1456
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,680
It's not right, it's wrong.

1457
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,960
Imagine if we made like that much money.

1458
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,720
We could just live our lives being like,

1459
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,640
eh, put it on the PCP account.

1460
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,000
Pretty much, pretty much.

1461
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,360
Do you know who I am?

1462
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,400
I'm on the PCP.

1463
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,160
It's free.

1464
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,200
It's great.

1465
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:32,560
Okay, I guess the only different thing that I have here

1466
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,640
is that I shave all my fucking leg hair off.

1467
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,120
Oh, God, that did happen.

1468
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,960
Oh, I shave all the hairs off my hands and legs

1469
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,160
and arms and feet.

1470
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,800
I've talked about doing that, but give was the one

1471
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,840
who actually committed.

1472
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,280
Punish Gibb and take.

1473
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,720
Jesus Christ.

1474
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,280
It was extremely gay, but I do think

1475
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,440
that having super smooth legs is very based

1476
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,480
for like five minutes.

1477
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:57,840
Sure, sure.

1478
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,320
Because it feels like, whoa, these are on my legs

1479
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,240
and you touch them and you're like, that's not my leg.

1480
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,200
That was fun.

1481
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:05,920
It was interesting.

1482
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,000
Which lecture was it, Gibb, that you,

1483
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,200
because you were in a lot of pain.

1484
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,000
It was my lecture.

1485
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,840
Yeah, it was the first lecture.

1486
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,200
Tom's right, okay, okay.

1487
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,880
We're like, because we, I shaved my legs

1488
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,040
and then I didn't know how to do it,

1489
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,920
like I did it wrong.

1490
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,920
I didn't realize I was giving myself

1491
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,400
like thousands of tiny microscopic cuts.

1492
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,680
I didn't see any blood.

1493
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,120
I mentioned that to Michelle later,

1494
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,280
and she was like, it should not hurt that much.

1495
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,800
That's not good, that that's.

1496
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,320
I was using like dull, like 7-Eleven razors.

1497
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,520
And I was scraping it all off.

1498
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,480
And the day after, well, I do it during the night,

1499
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,680
and then the day after, we did the OVA,

1500
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,840
which involved running around on the beach,

1501
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,200
rolling around in the sand,

1502
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,280
getting in the salty seawater,

1503
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,120
which fucked them up quite a bit.

1504
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,680
Low.

1505
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,240
And like that night, I think,

1506
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,880
when did we do the first lecture?

1507
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,400
Was it the day after that?

1508
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,160
The third or the fourth day?

1509
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,360
I think it's the fourth day.

1510
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday the night.

1511
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,400
The day after, I believe.

1512
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,520
They were in extreme pain.

1513
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,840
I was in constant pain the entire day,

1514
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,760
and I hated life.

1515
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,280
I regretted everything.

1516
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,280
It sucked.

1517
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:17,840
Yeah.

1518
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,920
Don't do it if you don't know what you're doing.

1519
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,080
But on the other hand, pretty fucking base.

1520
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:24,960
Just fuck it, man.

1521
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,120
Just do it.

1522
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,320
Pretty base, though.

1523
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,360
Yeah, pretty base.

1524
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,200
It was pretty base to do it.

1525
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,480
I've never felt so smooth.

1526
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,920
Indeed.

1527
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:32,400
Indeed.

1528
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,120
You're a hairy man.

1529
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,680
Gross, dude.

1530
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,880
I mean, I am a hairy man.

1531
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,600
I have shaved my body before,

1532
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,040
and yeah, it feels terrible.

1533
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,240
No, it doesn't.

1534
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,080
And it lasts like a day.

1535
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,760
I feel like once, like for a few minutes,

1536
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,280
it feels like really good.

1537
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,720
And then when the pain sets in, then it feels terrible.

1538
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,160
But when the hairs come back, they stop poking through.

1539
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:56,880
Well, when I shaved my torso now,

1540
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,200
and then until the hair starts moving around,

1541
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,840
I feel my shirt on my skin in a way that is very distracting.

1542
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,800
It's not painful exactly, but it sucks.

1543
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,640
I don't have a lot of chest hair,

1544
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,600
so that's not a big thing for me.

1545
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,000
But once in a while, I will shave my armpits

1546
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,360
just because I'm like, well, this is too long.

1547
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,320
Let's just start over again.

1548
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,560
I have done that before, and it also feels bad.

1549
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,280
And I hate it.

1550
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,800
It fucking hurts, especially when it grows back a little bit.

1551
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,840
And then there's prickles,

1552
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,200
and then you're stabbing yourself with your armpits.

1553
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,120
The armpits are the least bad part, I feel.

1554
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,600
You think so?

1555
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,360
Yeah, I don't know why.

1556
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,560
Well, maybe compared to other stuff.

1557
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,000
I mean, the armpits are fucking sensitive.

1558
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,080
I guess they are.

1559
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,280
Maybe I'm hard as nails.

1560
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,480
Maybe I'm the tough man.

1561
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,640
Like, I didn't pass out when I should have.

1562
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,400
Hard as nails.

1563
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,360
It ain't hard to tell.

1564
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,120
I sat through that whole Animorphs lecture.

1565
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,640
I learned about yirks.

1566
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,520
Yeah.

1567
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,120
Watch the fucking Animorphs lecture.

1568
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:55,840
There's a bunch of people.

1569
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,320
Go watch it.

1570
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,480
The reaction's been incredibly positive,

1571
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,280
which I'm happy about.

1572
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,960
K.A. Applegate approved.

1573
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,480
Because I was like sweating balls sitting there

1574
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,600
before we started being like, this could suck.

1575
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,320
Yeah, yeah.

1576
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,680
But no, it was good.

1577
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,440
Yeah, I promise you.

1578
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,000
And now the people are getting to voice their agreement.

1579
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,600
And it's great.

1580
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,080
I dig it.

1581
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,000
My favorite thing by far was this shit about zero space.

1582
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,520
I'm so happy that they came up with their own system

1583
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,960
of fast and light travel.

1584
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,880
It's at 11 K views already.

1585
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,400
After what, like two days?

1586
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,800
One day?

1587
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,440
Less than two days.

1588
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,040
And the lectures are slow burners.

1589
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,320
They retain serious viewership long-term.

1590
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,680
And they just spread like a virus.

1591
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,000
They got big aroma.

1592
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,720
I really don't know how much the risk of lecture.

1593
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,760
Because the content of it is like, it's pretty good.

1594
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,200
It's not like the best it could be.

1595
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,760
I feel like I fell short in a few areas.

1596
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,560
Yeah, they never are.

1597
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,480
But the subject matter, there's a lot of homestucks out there.

1598
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,400
And Vriska is a very contentious character.

1599
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,640
I title it like the best character in Homestuck.

1600
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,040
Indeed.

1601
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,000
Vriska 101.

1602
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,280
That makes me mad and angry.

1603
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,640
Are people going to jump on there and say, no.

1604
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,360
No, it's not true, Vriska Stucks.

1605
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,800
Is that going to bolster the views?

1606
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,760
I hope it does.

1607
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,200
Tom, when your lecture came out, I thought, oh boy,

1608
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,240
someone should post this on Reddit r slash animorphs.

1609
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,480
But then I was like, there's no way that exists.

1610
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,400
Or if it does, there's like five people on.

1611
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,200
Right.

1612
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,840
But you should definitely post the Vriska one on r slash Homestuck.

1613
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,920
Oh, I might get destroyed.

1614
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,280
But yes, I should.

1615
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,080
No.

1616
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,800
Wait, is it like a universal thing

1617
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,720
that you're not supposed to self promote on Reddit

1618
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,320
or is it only some subreddits?

1619
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,120
I assume it's, well, maybe not.

1620
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,200
Not every subreddit enforces that,

1621
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,440
but it is like general practice that like,

1622
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,480
unless it says otherwise, you're not supposed to self promote.

1623
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,120
Well, I mean, I'll fucking post it for you if you want me to.

1624
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,320
Yeah, I mean, I think it's fine on the Homestuck Reddit.

1625
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,400
The reason I have reservations is that Homestuck fans,

1626
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,800
like vast majority, are people who are still into Homestuck.

1627
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,640
Ergo people who are stupid.

1628
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,280
And they don't understand things like act six wasn't as good

1629
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,560
as the rest of Homestuck.

1630
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,920
Vriska did nothing wrong.

1631
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,920
They believe that all of the bad things.

1632
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,480
And they are the, you know,

1633
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,800
so those are the people on the Reddit

1634
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,880
and they will come to the video and they will say no.

1635
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,080
It would be like talking about,

1636
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,160
it's like when the Brony lecture is going to drop.

1637
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,160
And, you know.

1638
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:26,800
Oh yeah.

1639
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,000
I'm so excited for that.

1640
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,560
I forgot about that.

1641
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,960
Imagine all the comments that'll be in there.

1642
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,120
Dude.

1643
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,000
It'll be sick.

1644
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
I would love, I would love fucking.

1645
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,000
For the response to that one.

1646
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,640
I'm pretty excited.

1647
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,400
Yeah, I would imagine.

1648
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,200
Imagine if FNGR does a huge big thing.

1649
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,240
Imagine if anyone, like a misanthropony does all the little action to it.

1650
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,960
FNGR is such a fucking piece of shit that like,

1651
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,320
it would be so funny if,

1652
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,880
like if he tried to do anything about it,

1653
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,720
it would just like be,

1654
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,920
it would just make it even cooler that like,

1655
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,600
oh, FNGR went and like,

1656
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,520
he said all this shit in response to this video.

1657
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,040
It's like, that just means we're good.

1658
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,640
Like if it makes FNGR mad,

1659
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,800
that just shows you that you're on the right path

1660
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,640
and you, and you should continue.

1661
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,480
Shout out to my boy FNGR.

1662
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:10,640
Shout out to FNGR.

1663
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,840
Face to this very day.

1664
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,440
Love you, buddy.

1665
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,320
What was I saying?

1666
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,360
Oh, hey, did, did anyone ever post like,

1667
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,480
was there ever like a thread on Reddit about arm retrieval?

1668
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,080
Did that ever get posted there?

1669
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:28,480
I don't know.

1670
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,160
Did like, did, did, did R slash Homestuck have any response to arm retrieval?

1671
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,720
Strong disavowal, I'm sure.

1672
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,560
I feel like if, if it's as you say,

1673
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,000
and the people on R slash Homestuck,

1674
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,360
and I'm sure that you're right,

1675
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,600
that they're all like, no, no, X6 wasn't that bad.

1676
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,800
No, no, no, the ending was good.

1677
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,120
No, they probably hated it.

1678
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,200
Not all of them, I think it was posted there a little bit.

1679
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:54,160
A few people from who found arm retrieval via the Reddit

1680
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,920
are now like in RFCK.

1681
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,480
I think Shaddock was one of those people.

1682
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:58,880
Sick.

1683
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,640
He was a Homestuck man.

1684
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,680
He found arm retrieval and he was based, so he liked it.

1685
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,080
But it didn't get a lot of traction on the Reddit, I don't think.

1686
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,480
Speaking of Shaddock, I am having him, her,

1687
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,080
I don't know what Shaddock is.

1688
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,160
Sure, it's a him.

1689
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,720
I only know Shaddock has a gray blob from...

1690
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

1691
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,280
But I'm having Shaddock make a little thing for,

1692
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,920
for, for, I'm commissioning for a little,

1693
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:29,440
a little, little treat to slap into the fucking CWC 102 lecture.

1694
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,920
It's gonna be fun.

1695
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,400
Of what medium?

1696
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,200
It's gonna be...

1697
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,560
Are they, are they an art person?

1698
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,280
Animator.

1699
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,000
Animator.

1700
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,280
Oh, okay, okay, cool.

1701
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,440
This is gonna be a little funny, a little funny thing.

1702
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,920
They did the very first arm retrieval animated,

1703
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,800
if you remember that.

1704
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,680
Oh, that's right.

1705
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,880
Okay, right, right, I remember now.

1706
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,120
Based.

1707
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,920
It's based.

1708
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,680
It's based, dude.

1709
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,040
It's fucking based, dude.

1710
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,480
How long do you think the based cringe meme is going to subsist post-radcon?

1711
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:54,720
I thought it was dead.

1712
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,800
Because we're all still at least a year.

1713
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,440
At least a year.

1714
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,320
At least a year.

1715
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,120
I, I think, I thought it was like dead a few,

1716
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,160
like a day or two ago,

1717
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,000
but now that I'm in this call and I'm hearing it,

1718
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,040
I'm just like, yeah, you know, based on cringe is still based.

1719
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,640
Well, I know that it's not dead,

1720
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,800
because I am still saying it constantly in my real life.

1721
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,000
And that's, that's all it takes.

1722
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,680
I'm just, I'm gonna carry the torch to my grave.

1723
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,760
I wanna challenge someone to make images

1724
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,880
that we can use as emotes in the PCP Discord server

1725
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,080
that are based on cringe,

1726
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,000
that we can then upvote and, you know,

1727
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,560
make, let's keep this thing going.

1728
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,600
There's no, they don't look like anything.

1729
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Well, just, yeah, well, I use some artistic ingenuity folks

1730
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,680
and, you know, just sign on the look here.

1731
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,680
I'm, I'm, I'm remembering, uh, uh,

1732
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,120
Milhouse's dad playing, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1733
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,240
Oh God, what's that game where you draw?

1734
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,440
Pictionary?

1735
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,080
Not Pictionary.

1736
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,680
Is it Pictionary?

1737
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,920
Yeah, playing Pictionary and he draws the squiggle.

1738
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,120
It's dignity!

1739
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh, yeah.

1740
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,120
Oh, exactly, that's what I hope to see.

1741
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,400
Man, what the fuck?

1742
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,320
Milhouse's dad is the worst guy.

1743
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,280
No, he's the best guy.

1744
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,400
What the fuck?

1745
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,680
Kirk Van Houten.

1746
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,280
Oh, dude, next Radcon 5, Kirk Van Houten lecture.

1747
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,640
Oh, definitely.

1748
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,000
That's a meep lore.

1749
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,560
That's a, that's a risketeer lecture in terms of scale.

1750
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,520
You know, I, I, I'm the subject of curse here.

1751
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,200
Single character lectures.

1752
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah.

1753
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,400
Uh, fucking, yeah, be a risketeer, risketeer, ask.

1754
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,320
Um, so in that episode, he's like really mean to his wife

1755
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,960
and he's like yelling at her and like taking her for granted and stuff.

1756
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,360
I'm just curious, in any of his appearances,

1757
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,840
if he in fact had appearances before that episode,

1758
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,800
was that like something like he was shown to be like aggressive or rude to his wife?

1759
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,760
Or was that like kind of made for that video, for that episode?

1760
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,440
Was, was he, I mean, was he like the bad guy?

1761
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,720
I think it's, I mean, if I remember that episode,

1762
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,440
like that, he was being very rude and mean to his wife.

1763
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:02,080
I kind of just remember that like they just are angry at each other like the whole time

1764
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,200
and then they get divorced.

1765
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,800
Historically or just in that episode?

1766
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,280
Just in that, just in that episode.

1767
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,440
They were like just like normal parents, I think before that.

1768
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,240
I think that's true.

1769
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,640
There's, there's the one where in the magic eight ball episode,

1770
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,440
when Bart and Milhouse are like beating the crap out of each other,

1771
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,520
they come out and the mom is like,

1772
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,320
Milhouse is out of bed and full of beans.

1773
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,600
And it's like, it's a miracle and they just leave.

1774
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,720
That seemed like a pretty happy family at that time.

1775
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,520
They were doing good.

1776
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,240
Wait, wait, why was he full of beans?

1777
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,040
What did that mean?

1778
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,440
It was because he had in that episode.

1779
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,160
In that episode.

1780
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,200
Yeah, he got broken up with by the girl and he was like in bed and he was depressed.

1781
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,280
And then he found out that Bart did it.

1782
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,520
And he was killing Bart at that very moment.

1783
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,320
He like he left.

1784
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,040
He just started strangling Bart and kicking his ass.

1785
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,120
And they're like, oh yeah, he's back.

1786
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,640
Milhouse is back, baby.

1787
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,680
I remember that.

1788
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,880
Oh, that was great.

1789
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,840
That was fantastic.

1790
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,520
And ironically, the Simpsons is so old now,

1791
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,280
you could do a lecture on the Simpsons

1792
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,000
because so many new people don't get into it.

1793
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,240
The lecture on the Simpsons would be,

1794
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,760
there's way more of the Simpsons to talk about

1795
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,600
than there is of like Homestuck.

1796
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,720
It would have to be a very specific focus on like.

1797
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,280
I mean, you would have to be.

1798
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,080
I mean, do you guys know that?

1799
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,760
Fucking Hans Molman lecture.

1800
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,800
Yeah, yeah.

1801
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,880
Do you guys know the channel The Real Gyms?

1802
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,960
I think you've talked about it before.

1803
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,160
Yeah, The Real Gyms, he not like lectures, but he does like

1804
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,320
YouTube videos where he'll like spot like a character

1805
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,440
and talk about like their entire history throughout like the show.

1806
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,440
What's like the length of one of those?

1807
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,800
Just out of curiosity.

1808
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,160
Maybe like 20 minutes or something.

1809
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,280
Yeah, okay, okay.

1810
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,480
So you got to keep it limited scope.

1811
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,920
He did one on Hans Molman.

1812
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,360
He did an Edna Krabapal.

1813
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,000
I don't think there's one on Kirk Van Houten,

1814
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,720
but there might be.

1815
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,600
There should be.

1816
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,480
Let me find out.

1817
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,360
Let me find out.

1818
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,640
Why do we start talking about the Simpsons?

1819
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,600
I have no idea.

1820
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:00,640
I don't remember.

1821
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,600
Because it's a great show.

1822
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,360
Because it's a good show and everyone who didn't watch it

1823
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,720
missed out, didn't have a child.

1824
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,600
They're fucking Zoomers don't know back in the day.

1825
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,800
It's still going, right?

1826
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,000
They could watch it today.

1827
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,200
Yeah, but it's not good now.

1828
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,600
It's passed us from him.

1829
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,720
Yeah, it's not relevant.

1830
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,480
One day, every single person who worked on the first

1831
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,800
series season of The Simpsons will be dead,

1832
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,240
but The Simpsons will be alive.

1833
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,360
No, there is no Kirk Van Houten episode.

1834
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,360
Update your shit, bro.

1835
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,400
We need it.

1836
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,040
Real gyms.

1837
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,200
Okay.

1838
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,680
Well, hey, that said, how about voicemails?

1839
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,400
I got them right here.

1840
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:42,880
I'm ready to go.

1841
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,520
I guess we might as well move on to voicemails.

1842
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,200
Excellent.

1843
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,480
I've got a selection that will titillate the senses.

1844
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,200
I've no doubt.

1845
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,520
So everybody, of course, you know,

1846
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,920
speak pipe link down below, click on it,

1847
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,320
leave voicemails there, et cetera, et cetera.

1848
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,200
Now, of note, it's been like Ben said at the beginning.

1849
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,840
It's been like three weeks since we've had a real episode

1850
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,200
where we can answer voicemails.

1851
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,560
Now, there aren't that many.

1852
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,160
I think I have seven total.

1853
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,760
There's more like six, because there's like some

1854
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,880
two part of stuff here.

1855
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,120
But let's let's take a look.

1856
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:13,520
Here we go.

1857
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,480
First one is from Clyde Caliber.

1858
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,920
And let's see what he has in store for us and go.

1859
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,720
Best date idea you've ever heard in your entire life.

1860
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,640
Three, two, one, go.

1861
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,640
Take her to Best Buy.

1862
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,320
Go to the back where the blue rays are.

1863
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,880
Tell her to pick out whichever one she likes best.

1864
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,640
It doesn't matter which one it fucking is.

1865
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,400
You immediately go and buy it.

1866
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,320
If she's confused as to why

1867
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,800
and she doesn't want it for some reason,

1868
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,080
just tell her it's for your dad.

1869
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,040
Wow.

1870
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,960
That's his suggestion.

1871
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,480
You really know how to pick them, Naean.

1872
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,280
I liked it.

1873
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,280
What's your favorite date idea, guys?

1874
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,800
Jokes on him.

1875
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,560
Best Buy literally today announced

1876
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,240
that they're closing all of their stores.

1877
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,520
You can't go inside them.

1878
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,640
All stores?

1879
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,760
Wait, is this a corona thing?

1880
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,640
For the pandemic.

1881
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,680
For the pandemic thing.

1882
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:09,440
But you can only do curbside pickup now.

1883
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,240
So your plan is foiled already.

1884
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,160
I prefer a curb stomp pickup

1885
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,920
where they just kill me on the curb when I pull up.

1886
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,360
Maybe they can do that.

1887
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,400
When I go to Whole Foods,

1888
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,600
my local Whole Foods is connected to a Starbucks

1889
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,160
and it's funny.

1890
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,200
I see people wait outside the Starbucks

1891
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,440
and the barista comes out the door,

1892
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,560
asks what they want,

1893
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,200
and then brings it outside to them.

1894
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:33,680
Fascinating.

1895
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,640
It's very weird.

1896
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,400
Best date idea?

1897
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,280
I don't fucking know.

1898
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,080
Hey, hey, you know what is funny?

1899
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,600
Why would you ask me that?

1900
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,880
Yeah, Ben has no ideas.

1901
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:45,920
Clearly.

1902
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,480
My favorite date idea is self-isolation.

1903
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
Just stay indoors and you don't talk late.

1904
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,800
Yeah, Skype with your GF.

1905
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:54,720
Great idea.

1906
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,400
Okay, well, you know what?

1907
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,280
It doesn't matter.

1908
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,960
One of the reasons that I wanted to play this one

1909
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,600
was to remind me that I just watched

1910
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,800
the Steven Universe episodes.

1911
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,520
There's so...

1912
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,040
Oh, God, I haven't watched any of those.

1913
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,200
They're not all bad.

1914
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,960
I think they're 16 out now.

1915
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,400
I never even finished original Steven Universe.

1916
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,800
You should.

1917
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,400
I didn't watch the last five episodes.

1918
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,320
So you haven't seen the movie yet?

1919
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,000
I did see the movie.

1920
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:22,640
Oh, okay, good.

1921
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,840
That's better than the episodes.

1922
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,640
Fuck the episodes.

1923
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,760
Although there is some good stuff there.

1924
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,400
Okay, whatever.

1925
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,000
I was going to say that in the last...

1926
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,320
Actually, of note, this Friday,

1927
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,920
in fact, the day you're listening to this

1928
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,280
at like 7 p.m., the final two episodes,

1929
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,000
so there's like four of the mini half-episode episodes.

1930
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,520
That's how Steven Universe works.

1931
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,680
The final four Steven Universe episodes

1932
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,360
are airing like two day,

1933
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,600
and the series is ending forever.

1934
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,680
Steven Universe's future is over

1935
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,000
as of a couple hours after you're hearing this.

1936
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,280
So that's interesting.

1937
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,440
I guess the movie in a season afterwards

1938
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,800
never really caught on,

1939
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,680
because I completely forgot immediately

1940
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,560
that it was a thing.

1941
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,120
I don't blame you.

1942
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,320
After I heard that it was a thing.

1943
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,160
Michelle's been watching and been reminding me,

1944
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,760
and I finally caught up with her yesterday.

1945
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,400
And as always, I still like Steven Universe a lot,

1946
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,560
though I always make fun of it because there's some dumb shit.

1947
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,840
Okay, but there was one...

1948
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,600
What's the general plot?

1949
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,320
What does Steven...

1950
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,200
Oh, sure, sure.

1951
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:17,920
I think...

1952
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,160
In summary, so like Steven Universe happened,

1953
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,160
then they saved the world,

1954
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,360
then the movie happens,

1955
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,120
and they're dealing with like fallout of,

1956
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,680
you know, like some fucked up shit that's still going on.

1957
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,720
Now that that's done,

1958
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,560
it's just a little bit after that,

1959
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,200
and basically it's just the story of Steven

1960
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,520
having PTSD from his experiences,

1961
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,400
and like acclimating back to being like a normal teenager.

1962
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,720
I think you maybe explained that somewhere before.

1963
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,880
Yeah, I mean, it's a little hard to see Steven

1964
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,080
be such a whiny baby when he used to be such a Chad child,

1965
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,840
but you know, it's understandable.

1966
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,600
Doesn't he have like PTSD now?

1967
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,680
Huh? Say what you said.

1968
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

1969
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,560
What?

1970
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,840
That's pretty much the issue.

1971
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,680
That's almost exactly what they're implying,

1972
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,280
that yeah, he's got like PTSD,

1973
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,120
and it makes him all fucked up in some ways.

1974
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,960
He's got like weird...

1975
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,320
Everyone's like going off to college

1976
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,120
and like doing their own thing,

1977
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,400
and Steven doesn't know what he wants to do,

1978
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,560
and he feels really lonely and scared,

1979
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,960
because he's missing people that he loved and stuff.

1980
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,080
But...

1981
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,560
Post-traumatic Steven disorder.

1982
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,800
The reason that I mention it is because,

1983
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,960
okay, here's a spoiler of an event that happens.

1984
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,400
I won't tell you how it goes.

1985
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,840
Okay, I have to tell you how it goes

1986
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,440
for the sake of this event,

1987
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,520
but Steven, like I said,

1988
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,720
he's feeling really lonely,

1989
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,560
and Connie is going to go off to college,

1990
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,240
and Steven doesn't know what he wants to do.

1991
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,840
So he talks to like Ruby and Sapphire separately,

1992
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,280
because they're doing their own stuff,

1993
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,800
and they both suggest that Steven propose to Connie.

1994
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,240
These two have never been on a date.

1995
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:42,720
What?

1996
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,360
Connie gave him a kiss on the cheek once in the movie

1997
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,200
to propose marriage.

1998
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,000
They're Jim.

1999
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,640
Is the proposal.

2000
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,040
They're Jim fucked before.

2001
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,680
Actually, Garnet later says like, yeah.

2002
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,880
Are you trying to tell...

2003
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,280
Nate.

2004
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:55,520
What?

2005
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,640
Are you trying to tell me

2006
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,400
that you don't think Steven and Connie

2007
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,320
like know each other well enough?

2008
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,560
Ben, they have not been on one date ever.

2009
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,320
You think marriage is the appropriate step there?

2010
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,440
Are you fucking insane?

2011
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,040
They've spent like three seasons together.

2012
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,480
They don't need to go on a date.

2013
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,960
They fucking spent a huge amount of time together.

2014
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,840
Well, I guess it's a good thing

2015
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,240
that the narrative literally agrees with me and not you,

2016
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,840
because Connie says, obviously, no,

2017
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,800
I'm not going to do that.

2018
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,840
So there you go.

2019
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:18,320
Why did...

2020
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,760
Well, look, I'm not saying they should...

2021
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,120
No, you fucking idiot.

2022
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,800
I didn't say yes, they should get married.

2023
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,520
I said it doesn't matter

2024
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,200
that they haven't been on a formal date.

2025
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,200
Well, okay, I mean,

2026
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,800
I don't think that's how romance works,

2027
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,600
so whatever.

2028
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,720
Look, the point of it is...

2029
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:30,960
What?

2030
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,200
Ben, what is wrong with you?

2031
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,160
No, it doesn't matter, Ben.

2032
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,240
The point is that in this fucking retarded ass situation,

2033
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,040
Steven sets out this like amazing spread.

2034
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,960
It's an incredibly romantic scene,

2035
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,800
and he like sings the song for Connie,

2036
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,800
and Connie is visibly wooed

2037
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,520
and would definitely fuck if pressed.

2038
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,840
But instead of like doing anything romantic,

2039
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,400
he just jumped straight to marry me.

2040
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,680
And I just wanted to say,

2041
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,560
everything about the way he did that was perfect,

2042
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,200
except he had way too high of ambitions

2043
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,400
for this one scene.

2044
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,560
But it was like a really great romantic scene

2045
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,760
that he just, for some reason,

2046
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,080
in his weird asexual autistic brain

2047
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,240
thought that marriage was the appropriate step to go to.

2048
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,840
Aren't they like 16?

2049
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,560
Yeah, yeah.

2050
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,240
That's super weird.

2051
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,080
How is she going to college at 16?

2052
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,720
She's actually like a year younger

2053
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,240
than Steven, I think, too.

2054
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,080
So I don't know.

2055
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:22,720
You tell me.

2056
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,280
The fuck?

2057
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,000
She's really smart.

2058
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,840
Is this, I cannot imagine.

2059
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,960
Is this played for laughs?

2060
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,960
Um, okay, I mean.

2061
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,120
The entirety of Steven Universe is played for laughs.

2062
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,520
The setup is absolutely played for laughs,

2063
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,800
but the emotional consequences of Connie saying no

2064
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,960
is legitimately devastating to Steven.

2065
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,720
Well, okay.

2066
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,520
I guess that makes sense.

2067
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,080
Yeah, yeah.

2068
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,680
Hmm, I don't know.

2069
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,960
I don't know if that was pretty good.

2070
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,920
But I wanted to win.

2071
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,400
I'm pretty excited for the finale of Steven Universe.

2072
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,360
I'm looking forward to it.

2073
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,160
I guess I'll get caught up.

2074
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,000
But anyway, you should.

2075
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,800
I mean, I'll do it.

2076
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
The idea is that he needs to propose to her.

2077
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,120
What, to like keep her from going away to college?

2078
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,000
Oh, you know what?

2079
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
He specifically proposes.

2080
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,280
Yes, Ben, but even more than that,

2081
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,960
he proposes to say like,

2082
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,280
because he gets the idea from Ruby and Sapphire,

2083
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,000
let's be Stevonnie forever.

2084
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,040
Let's like do that.

2085
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,360
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2086
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,640
That's fucking weird.

2087
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,800
Yeah, it's what you get for listening to Gens.

2088
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,440
I mean, it's funny because Garnet herself says like Steven,

2089
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,520
you listen to Ruby and Sapphire to like love-addled retards.

2090
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,160
Listen to me, Garnet, because I'm smarter than them,

2091
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,440
even though I am them.

2092
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,800
I don't quite get it, but.

2093
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,920
Garnet is that.

2094
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,200
For this particular scene, she needed to not be,

2095
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,160
so she wasn't.

2096
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,680
And it was perfect.

2097
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,480
Love that.

2098
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,720
Yeah, I know, I know.

2099
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,160
It's not perfect.

2100
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,040
Next voicemail, Jesus Christ.

2101
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,920
Okay, okay.

2102
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:48,880
Oh, you're gonna love this.

2103
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,160
This is from Virgin Rage is calling in.

2104
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,840
Let's hear what she has to say.

2105
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,080
Go.

2106
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:54,720
I can't wait.

2107
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,960
Oh, you're so nice, Jacks.

2108
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,200
You're so sweet and kind and wonderful.

2109
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,840
And oh, I love that new haircut you got.

2110
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,000
Oh, you're so handsome and you're so funny

2111
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,240
and so talented and nice and strong.

2112
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,400
And you'll make a perfect boyfriend with it.

2113
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,720
Oh, you're gonna make a perfect husband when you grow up.

2114
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,000
You grow up.

2115
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,440
Then I won't hit him.

2116
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,880
You just fuck me over.

2117
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,000
That's it.

2118
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,240
Because they're lying to you, they don't actually mean it.

2119
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,480
Hard to agree, I guess.

2120
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,200
Hard to agree.

2121
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,480
I think they mean it.

2122
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,240
I'm gonna vote yes on that.

2123
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,800
These women are gaslighting you and that is emotional abuse,

2124
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,640
that they're not having sex with you.

2125
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,600
Got to agree.

2126
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,160
Got to agree.

2127
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,840
I mean, imagine your whole day being told how handsome and cute you are

2128
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,320
and none of the women are having sex with you.

2129
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:46,880
Something's wrong.

2130
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,520
Don't let them get away with it.

2131
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,360
Make them pay.

2132
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,480
Yeah, that's the only thing to do.

2133
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,080
Because they get what they fucking deserve.

2134
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,960
Make them pay.

2135
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:55,360
Fuck it.

2136
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,240
Make them pay.

2137
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,760
I'm not telling you to do anything specific.

2138
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,880
Just use your imagination.

2139
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,600
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

2140
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,440
Make them pay for your only fan's account.

2141
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,040
That's the way, that's the way.

2142
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,240
Okay, next one we've got Radcon Forever.

2143
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,680
Okay, and take it away, go.

2144
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,160
Bro, so like, what if you guys get stuck in your old Virginia place

2145
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,920
because of the corona shit?

2146
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,960
Like, what if, what if like,

2147
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,920
great question and like, none of you guys can like, go anywhere?

2148
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,080
You're stuck in Radcon Forever.

2149
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:27,840
That's the joke.

2150
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,240
Bye-bye.

2151
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,320
Excellent.

2152
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,240
I guess, I guess we would have just had to like,

2153
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,640
crash at Digi and fix a house.

2154
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,560
That's, it would have been the only thing to do, yeah.

2155
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,040
Or, I mean, the alternative would be drain the Radcon fund on like,

2156
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,560
getting a fucking hotel until the next time as we can leave.

2157
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,640
I would have considered just like,

2158
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,080
renting a car and driving home.

2159
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:52,080
I mean, obviously, the only viable thing would have been

2160
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,080
immediately kickstarting Radcon 5 and doing it.

2161
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,360
Yeah, yeah.

2162
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,040
Spend your precious money.

2163
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,200
You don't have the ability to go to work anymore.

2164
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,320
Spend your money on us.

2165
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,440
Right, right.

2166
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,560
Please.

2167
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,200
Imagine, imagine if there had been like,

2168
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,440
I mean, I can't imagine that they would have like,

2169
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,800
said like, no traveling within the country.

2170
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,920
But like, I can imagine a scenario in which like,

2171
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,560
flights stop leaving the country.

2172
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,040
Yeah.

2173
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,840
And that would have been.

2174
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,280
That's definitely possible.

2175
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,960
It was the most vulnerable probably.

2176
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:27,440
It would have been really funny if you were just stuck here for like,

2177
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,560
a month maybe or something.

2178
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,200
Years.

2179
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:29,840
Lol.

2180
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,400
I mean, on the one hand, it's, it would be pretty scary because,

2181
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:39,120
I'm, you know, just like coronavirus, it's a pandemic.

2182
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,520
I want to be, I don't know, in a place I'm used to the least.

2183
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,000
A place where you can get healthcare that doesn't cost

2184
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,320
$3,000 to get a coronavirus test.

2185
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,400
Yeah, that's, that's also the thing.

2186
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,720
But like, on the other hand, it would be pretty cool to have an excuse

2187
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,040
to stay in America for an extended period of time.

2188
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:57,440
Sure.

2189
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,320
It's, it's not really a thing to like get a flight and that leaves

2190
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,680
like a bunch of months later.

2191
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,800
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2192
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,040
Like you have to stay for a certain amount of time.

2193
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,080
And then if you stay for too long, you're an illegal immigrant.

2194
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,200
You got to get out.

2195
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,960
You know, I got a good deal on me and Tom's plane tickets.

2196
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:21,200
But it's hurt, like, I guess like the price of tickets drop precipitously

2197
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,160
because of the pandemic.

2198
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,680
So it actually would have cost less if I had waited till the last minute.

2199
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,200
Ah, it's one of those things.

2200
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,000
No way to predict.

2201
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,480
Yeah, there was no way to know at the time, unfortunately.

2202
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,120
Hey, you know, I just thought of something.

2203
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,280
I realized that I'm so scared of flying.

2204
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,520
I'm so afraid of it.

2205
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,480
You said, you say you realized, was this not a thing earlier?

2206
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,960
I was so uncomfortable being there,

2207
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,240
watching you have like all but a panic attack while flying

2208
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,960
and being completely confused as to what to do,

2209
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,920
if anything, to comfort this poor man.

2210
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,200
No, I mean, there was nothing you could.

2211
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,040
It was just like a descent into just like madness

2212
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,800
because like we're getting on the plane,

2213
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,800
we're getting on the plane the first time.

2214
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,320
I didn't used to be like this.

2215
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,600
I didn't used to do.

2216
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,400
You just have to understand this from my perspective

2217
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,480
because like we're getting on the first flight

2218
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,040
and we're walking down into the back of the plane

2219
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,640
because we're in coach.

2220
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,240
And like you just like are like still in generally good spirits.

2221
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,320
And you admitted off like comment of like,

2222
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,000
oh yeah, I'm not really a fan of flying.

2223
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,920
And I didn't know how serious to take that.

2224
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,120
And like you were hamming it up

2225
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,440
because like we're walking past one of like the stewardess who's like,

2226
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,680
hey, we're going to be okay, right?

2227
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,320
And he's just like, yeah, we're going to be fine.

2228
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,880
And I was like, oh, there's Ben having a good time,

2229
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,960
riffing on the help.

2230
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,000
How hilarious.

2231
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,360
Not realizing he was deadly serious about this question.

2232
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,640
My mask cracked.

2233
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,240
My mask like progressively cracked.

2234
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,520
I got more afraid with every flight.

2235
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,120
I was worse on the second one

2236
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,960
and worst on the third on the one home.

2237
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,240
You'd think it would go the opposite way

2238
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:01,040
because it proved to, you know, turn it okay.

2239
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,400
I'm not kidding.

2240
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:07,040
I spent like every night at Radcon like,

2241
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,640
and it got worse as it went on.

2242
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,320
I was like, I would like have trouble sleeping

2243
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,760
because I would be thinking about,

2244
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,520
oh God, I have to take another flight home.

2245
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,560
I have to fly again.

2246
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,120
Like it cost me sleep and it was upsetting.

2247
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,440
And I don't know what's wrong with me.

2248
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,440
This is like a new thing.

2249
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,280
This is like, like I flew to Radcon three and did I like flying?

2250
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,840
No, but I didn't like flight of Radcon three

2251
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,360
because you lived in the boxing area.

2252
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:36,800
No, you flew.

2253
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,440
No, I lived in Georgia at the time.

2254
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,480
Oh, that's right.

2255
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,360
That was back in the day.

2256
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,000
Yeah, and like I didn't, on the flight home,

2257
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,600
I had like such a strong like fucking episode

2258
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,080
that I had to like get out of my seat

2259
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,960
and like fucking hustle to the front of the plane

2260
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,560
and be and like accost the flight attendants

2261
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,000
and be like, what is happening?

2262
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,840
What are we doing?

2263
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,360
Why, was there turbulence or something?

2264
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,560
While you were in flight?

2265
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:04,960
Yes.

2266
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,160
There was no turbulence,

2267
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,440
but Ben was just like constantly like looking out the windows

2268
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,480
and being like, where are we?

2269
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:10,960
I don't get it.

2270
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,000
I don't understand what's going on.

2271
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,280
And I'm just like, Ben, we're above the clouds

2272
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,160
and it's nighttime.

2273
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,440
That's why you can't see anything,

2274
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,000
but like he was not having any of this shit.

2275
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,280
I could see the clouds.

2276
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,120
I could see that we were above the clouds,

2277
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:27,360
but I kept feeling as though I had a constant feeling

2278
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,400
like we were turning.

2279
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,240
We weren't turning,

2280
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,000
but I kept thinking that we were turning

2281
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,600
and I was like, why are we turning?

2282
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,040
Where are we going?

2283
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,640
And then we changed altitude at some point

2284
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,680
and I was like, why is this happening?

2285
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,000
Why?

2286
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,760
No, no, something's wrong, something's wrong.

2287
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,440
And I had to go ask the flight attendants,

2288
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:48,480
like, is this normal?

2289
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,200
Is this normal?

2290
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,560
And they were like, yes, this is normal.

2291
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,160
And I'm like, okay.

2292
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,760
And I sat down again.

2293
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,680
And it was fucking based.

2294
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,720
Did you have like, did you have like action movie like?

2295
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,320
There was no screens or anything.

2296
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:03,760
No.

2297
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,160
There was, was it like, like intense music?

2298
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,000
The first flight was better

2299
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,320
because we had the screens and it showed our altitude.

2300
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,480
So I could watch the screen and be like, okay,

2301
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,760
I see where we are.

2302
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,800
I see our altitude.

2303
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,760
It's normal.

2304
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,080
We're not like, we're not plummeting.

2305
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,520
We're on track.

2306
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,440
This is reasonable.

2307
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,440
But the second two flights did not have those.

2308
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:27,360
And I, you have no idea what's,

2309
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,880
there's no frame of reference, what's going on.

2310
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,400
I don't know if every flight has this,

2311
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,640
but I, I've discovered recently that when,

2312
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,880
when planes don't have the screens that show a thing,

2313
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,600
a lot of them do have like a Wi-Fi connection thing

2314
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,480
that you can use to actually show the progress

2315
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,240
and all those stats on your phone if you connect to that.

2316
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,440
So perhaps that would be a helpful thing.

2317
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,040
You could usually go to pay for that though.

2318
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,280
And that's, I mean, it's been freed.

2319
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,800
I mean, my flight had free Wi-Fi.

2320
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,400
I've never had a free thing.

2321
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,080
My, my flight had free Wi-Fi.

2322
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,040
Anyway, I just thought I'd mentioned that.

2323
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,680
It was a weird and unpleasant thing that happened.

2324
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,560
And I don't like it.

2325
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,760
I hope that gets better.

2326
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah.

2327
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,520
I know that statistically flying is the safest way to travel,

2328
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,760
but it is also the scariest.

2329
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,000
You know, I mean, you're the least likely to die.

2330
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:14,880
Sure.

2331
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,560
But, but I constantly think I am going to die.

2332
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:18,960
I understand that.

2333
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,960
You're the most likely to shit yourself.

2334
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,720
Maybe you're more comfortable like, I mean,

2335
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,880
imagine Radcon 5, let's just say theoretically,

2336
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,800
it's in Virginia Beach again or whatever.

2337
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,320
You could maybe take a train.

2338
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,600
It would take longer, but you know.

2339
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:33,520
It was so bad that I'm considering just never flying again

2340
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,760
and taking the train just to avoid feeling that way.

2341
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,680
I don't really see any downsides.

2342
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:43,120
But then like, even though it would probably be more expensive

2343
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,120
and take like 10 times as long.

2344
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:45,760
Possible.

2345
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,520
Smash cut to you being on the train.

2346
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,360
You look at the window and it's dark and you're like,

2347
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,320
wait, where are we?

2348
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,040
Where are we going?

2349
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,000
Oh, and the plane is plummeting towards the train

2350
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,360
directly at Ben's window.

2351
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,760
What, what, why is our altitude changed?

2352
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,720
Where are we going?

2353
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,360
Like, like the, like the shitty trains,

2354
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,520
like the commuter rail sucks.

2355
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,360
But like, like a good train, like a cellar or whatever,

2356
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,800
is like, those are a joy.

2357
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,440
Those are just a fucking, like a cross-country train

2358
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,320
or just a treat.

2359
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:13,680
They're just a treat.

2360
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,880
Ben, your insistence on taking the train

2361
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,120
reminds me a lot of one Joseph Biden

2362
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,040
talking about investing in rail.

2363
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,640
He loves, that's the one thing.

2364
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,560
That's the one thing that I got it.

2365
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,720
You got a hand, it's just like ISIS.

2366
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,200
You do not have that.

2367
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,520
Biden, you got, you got a handed to him.

2368
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,720
He's a big fan of rail and so am I.

2369
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:33,760
Fair enough.

2370
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,080
Good for him.

2371
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,360
And so is ISIS.

2372
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,040
My hashtag, my president.

2373
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,640
All right, let's go on to our next voicemail here

2374
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,120
from an individual named Corn.

2375
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,640
All right, Corn, take it away.

2376
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,640
Hey, PCP, y'all better stay inside

2377
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,960
and be practicing that social distancing.

2378
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,920
Because if not, you're all fucked.

2379
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,640
But anyway, my question is,

2380
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,280
do y'all have any like media you'd recommend

2381
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,160
people going through while they're stuck

2382
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,360
holed up inside?

2383
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,240
Like YouTube videos, TV shows,

2384
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,720
Vidya, anything that you'd just like recommend

2385
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,640
for like coming to Mumps?

2386
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,120
Is that it?

2387
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,360
Yeah.

2388
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2389
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,240
Got it, quarantine media recommendations.

2390
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:16,720
Got it.

2391
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,400
End of, end of, end of voicemail.

2392
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,280
Y'all better be social distancing.

2393
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,440
I have a bunch of things that I like.

2394
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,320
Here, I'll tell you what I really long

2395
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,040
final fantasy, let's play, or speed runs from like a.

2396
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,160
Just play the game.

2397
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:33,920
No, it's gay.

2398
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,160
No, like, like speed runs of like final fantasy,

2399
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,880
seven, eight, nine, six, seven, eight, nine from,

2400
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,680
from like GDQ.

2401
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,520
You learn a lot watching speed runs that you won't get

2402
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,400
just playing through anyway.

2403
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,680
Yeah, not every speed run is interesting,

2404
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,960
but the final, the really long final fantasy ones,

2405
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,600
I can't get enough.

2406
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,600
Bro, I was just, I'm just gonna, I said this the other day,

2407
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,080
but I was just watching a speed run of Chrono Trigger.

2408
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,320
It just felt good to just look at that game.

2409
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:58,800
Oh, God.

2410
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,600
Did you watch the one by Puexel from like 2016 or something?

2411
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,560
The one, I remember, the Chrono Trigger one,

2412
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,080
it was like the final game of like some AGDQ.

2413
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:10,720
I think it was that.

2414
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,960
And like, at the end, like they passed $3 million,

2415
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,400
and it's like, the crowd goes fucking crazy.

2416
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,200
It was great.

2417
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,000
I love it, because they did all the end game quests and stuff.

2418
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,680
Oh, it was satisfying, you shit.

2419
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2420
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:22,640
Good shit.

2421
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,280
My other recommendation would be.

2422
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,720
Remember when Square Enix was good?

2423
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,680
Ah, kill me.

2424
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,720
I'm sorry, go on.

2425
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:28,960
No.

2426
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:36,960
The fucking Yogg's cast, Shadow of Israel,

2427
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,440
I haven't watched it in a while,

2428
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,480
but I watched it like maybe like six or seven years ago.

2429
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,360
And when I found it, I thought it was like the coolest thing ever.

2430
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,360
It's a really long Let's Play series,

2431
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,080
but it really goes places you don't expect it to go.

2432
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:54,560
I would, if you've never watched, I don't know,

2433
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,640
I feel like Yogg's cast isn't that relevant anymore,

2434
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,280
but like, I don't know, Shadow of Israel

2435
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,200
was a very cool Minecraft series that is not.

2436
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,960
Oh man, did all of those guys get me tooed?

2437
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,360
Can I ethically consume this content?

2438
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,640
I don't know, did he?

2439
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,920
Is that true?

2440
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:10,960
I think so.

2441
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:11,760
I don't really know.

2442
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,920
I disavow that I said that.

2443
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,240
I don't know.

2444
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,760
I don't know, whatever.

2445
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,120
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2446
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,160
Give it a shot.

2447
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,720
Have I talked about it and how it's like,

2448
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,040
you think it's just...

2449
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,320
You have talked about it, yeah.

2450
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,160
You think they're just playing Minecraft,

2451
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:29,040
but then like some weird shit starts to happen

2452
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,160
and like suddenly there's like this whole narrative

2453
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,720
that emerges and it's cool, man.

2454
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,920
I guess I've kind of spoiled that reveal

2455
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,800
just by talking about it, but like, it's cool, man.

2456
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,720
People need to know the hook anyway.

2457
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,120
Yeah.

2458
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:43,680
So there you go.

2459
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,280
Okay, give Tom, you want to suggest something?

2460
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:47,920
I got a few.

2461
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,960
Animorphs, obviously.

2462
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,520
Fucking based.

2463
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:52,560
Read that.

2464
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,040
That's the time.

2465
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,520
All the...

2466
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,840
It's all like PDFs are available for free, right?

2467
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,120
They're all available for free.

2468
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,400
How do I open PDF?

2469
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,720
But how do I open PDF?

2470
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,720
Exactly, we're trapped here.

2471
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,560
Listen, Jack.

2472
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,960
Actually, speaking of Jack...

2473
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,560
Hey man, hey Jack.

2474
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,000
How do I open PDF?

2475
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,400
You're a dang, you're a dang junkyard pole cat.

2476
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,640
Oh my god.

2477
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,240
The second thing I'm going to recommend

2478
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,840
is Tales from the Gas Station,

2479
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,200
which is a series starring character named Jack.

2480
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:26,320
I thought you were going to go with Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

2481
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,760
because there's a Jack in that as well.

2482
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,760
There is a Jack in that as well.

2483
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,840
Jack is a common name.

2484
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,120
I don't know if you're aware,

2485
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,960
but there are many Jacks throughout all of the media.

2486
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,560
I don't know if he claimed that being in stock.

2487
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,920
That was fucked up.

2488
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,560
Yeah, yeah.

2489
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,320
Jacks had a long and storied adventure

2490
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,000
all throughout the years.

2491
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,080
But yeah, no, Tales from the Gas Station's great.

2492
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,680
If you like creepypasta kind of story,

2493
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:52,000
but it's humorous and tongue-in-cheek.

2494
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,560
It kind of pokes fun at the genre.

2495
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,280
It's pretty great.

2496
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,400
I love it, 10 out of 10.

2497
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,640
Let's give people, since this is a practical question

2498
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,440
of all this quarantine,

2499
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,560
do you know where they can find it?

2500
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,280
Where it's available?

2501
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,720
You can, it's on No Sleep, on Reddit.

2502
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,280
But if you prefer listening to it,

2503
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,760
Mr. Creepypasta does a narration of it on YouTube.

2504
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,280
And it's very well done.

2505
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,480
That's how I listen to it.

2506
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,520
I highly recommend it.

2507
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,720
And if you really enjoy it,

2508
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,200
Jack, Gas Station Jack,

2509
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,800
the guy who writes the stories,

2510
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,800
also has two novelizations

2511
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,320
that expand upon the story available on Amazon.

2512
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,520
I have both of them in hardback.

2513
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,160
They're very good.

2514
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:26,720
Cool, cool.

2515
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,960
And the last thing I was going to recommend

2516
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,360
is, I don't remember.

2517
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,480
So I'm just going to say those two.

2518
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:32,720
Sure.

2519
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,040
All right, Gabe, what do you recommend?

2520
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,360
Go to Gibb and Take.Site and read Bale, Jaype,

2521
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,880
and the Lord of Ghosts comic.

2522
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,160
Those are base.

2523
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:42,800
Those are good.

2524
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:49,280
Aside from that, I guess most people probably have

2525
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,560
a long list of things

2526
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,320
that they've been meaning to get around to.

2527
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,200
Just do one of those.

2528
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,560
Yeah, check your back.

2529
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:59,360
I would probably, if I have, I mean,

2530
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,880
I can work on the internet,

2531
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,520
so I have no real excuse to not work.

2532
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,080
But if I'm unable to do anything,

2533
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:07,440
if I'm unable to move,

2534
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,640
I'm going to try and figure out

2535
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,480
how to watch all of Star Trek,

2536
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,280
the next generation of the meaning to get around to that.

2537
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:13,840
Queen.

2538
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,880
That's what I'm talking about.

2539
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,840
I should do that as well.

2540
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,600
That's a big one.

2541
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,760
And yeah, big old things

2542
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,200
that you don't have the time

2543
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,480
to usually get around to.

2544
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,120
Smart.

2545
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:26,240
Watch every video by Thought Slime.

2546
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,840
Listen to Chappo, Trap House.

2547
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,280
Get radicalized.

2548
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,640
Now's the time.

2549
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,240
It's never been a better time to see

2550
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,520
in your house than right now.

2551
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,840
It's never been more important, guys.

2552
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,240
Oh, and play Pokemon Go.

2553
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:39,280
Oh, you can't.

2554
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,040
Oh, fuck.

2555
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:41,920
Hey, I got a couple.

2556
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,960
The last thing I was going to say

2557
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,120
was a critical role.

2558
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,600
If you want to just like literally do nothing,

2559
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:50,000
like there's so much fucking critical role

2560
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,120
to get caught up on.

2561
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,600
There's like literally thousands of hours

2562
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,040
of over the two campaigns.

2563
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:56,320
It's super fun.

2564
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:56,800
It's great.

2565
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,000
Critical Role is like a bunch of professional voice actors,

2566
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,680
DM'd by Matthew Mercer,

2567
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,080
playing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

2568
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,440
And it sounds gay, super fucking based,

2569
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,080
because they all are doing like professional voice over

2570
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:10,960
for all their characters.

2571
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,040
And they get into character and like Matt Mercer

2572
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,400
does like 50 different voices

2573
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,000
and does voices for all the enemies

2574
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,280
and all the NPCs.

2575
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,400
Oh, it's grand.

2576
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,480
10 out of 10 love critical role.

2577
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,520
Definitely watch it.

2578
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,640
I guess I could get maybe I'll start watching.

2579
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,480
I'm sort of I'm sort of out of things

2580
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,920
to watch on YouTube these days.

2581
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,280
Maybe I should start watching.

2582
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,320
I should go back and catch up on the seat.

2583
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,520
This the the the the the sea team that fucking.

2584
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,520
Oh God, what's the acquis acquisitions incorporated

2585
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,240
the sea team?

2586
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,640
Yeah, the like they do like a D&D thing.

2587
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,000
Yeah, it's the penny.

2588
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,520
It's the penny run by the penny.

2589
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,160
I don't actually I don't watch the main series.

2590
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,600
Acquisitions incorporated.

2591
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,640
I own I mostly watch the like side series

2592
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,720
with all their like fucking second rate friends.

2593
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,880
You nobody's ever heard of now base.

2594
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,120
Well, I've got some obvious suggestions.

2595
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,640
But look, with the amount of time you got here,

2596
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,680
there has never in there will never be very likely

2597
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,080
a better time to catch up on one piece.

2598
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,320
It's still my favorite thing.

2599
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,080
You I mean, you can catch up on one piece

2600
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,480
if you dedicate yourself over like two weeks

2601
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,760
without too much of a sweat.

2602
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:17,920
I would say.

2603
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,480
Oh, yeah.

2604
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:21,920
I have a little one piece to catch up on myself.

2605
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:25,280
And then you can listen to the podcast every week, folks.

2606
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,080
Wouldn't that be fun?

2607
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,600
And you definitely start track.

2608
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,080
Next generation is the best so far.

2609
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,160
But if you like a little more edgy war stuff,

2610
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,480
you can check out Deep Space Nine or the original

2611
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,680
if you like more goofy shit.

2612
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:42,160
And also it's a great time for big, long, old RPGs.

2613
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,520
So how about fucking, you know,

2614
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,720
Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, any of them seven

2615
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,760
is a good place to start.

2616
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,160
I guess six, five, nine.

2617
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:54,160
I realize I forgot that I had like Final Fantasy nine,

2618
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,600
like the PlayStation one version.

2619
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,440
Just I bought it one day and I never played it.

2620
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,320
And now I'm playing it.

2621
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:58,800
Do it.

2622
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,520
It's a great game.

2623
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,720
Dude, you would love nine.

2624
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,840
I think it's really mine is so fucking good.

2625
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,160
Going off the Star Trek recommendation,

2626
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:10,080
if you like Star Trek and you finish Star Trek,

2627
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:14,400
Babylon Five is so fucking good.

2628
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,000
It's amazing.

2629
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,240
It's another show that came out around, you know,

2630
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:21,200
a little like a couple of years, I think after TNG,

2631
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,720
it was like mid nineties, really fucking great,

2632
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,400
great characters, great story.

2633
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:27,680
Love it.

2634
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:30,000
If you want more like cool sci-fi stuff,

2635
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Babylon Five does not disappoint.

2636
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,160
Did you say bad that you hate nine just now?

2637
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,760
No, I said I never beat it.

2638
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,320
Oh, okay.

2639
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,440
Well, that's, that's fine.

2640
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,080
That's fine.

2641
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,560
I still have to go back and beat three and eight.

2642
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,760
I never beat six.

2643
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,120
I never beat six either,

2644
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,040
even though I consider it my favorite one.

2645
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,600
That's all right.

2646
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,880
There's tons to do in there.

2647
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,800
Oh, they're good, good games.

2648
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,040
Was there something else I was going to suggest?

2649
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,920
Also, how about Legend of Dragoon?

2650
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:56,160
There's a classic game that nobody talks about anymore.

2651
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,600
We'll play Legend of Dragoon.

2652
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,320
Great game.

2653
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,440
I never beat that one either.

2654
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,120
That game gets off the fucking rails in a good way.

2655
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,720
Remember that legacy, Ben,

2656
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,920
of how our disc three of Legend of Dragoon was broken

2657
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,880
for so many years we could not play?

2658
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:11,760
Jeff or whatever.

2659
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,840
I think it was Matt.

2660
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,960
Matt, he was playing Frisbee with the disc.

2661
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,240
Oh, wait, no, that was later.

2662
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,280
What about Buck?

2663
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:24,880
Yeah, a guy in our fucking Boy Scout troop broke

2664
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,800
disc three of Legend of Dragoon,

2665
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,000
and it took forever for us to get our parents

2666
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,480
to talk to his parents and make him fucking

2667
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,440
buy us a new one.

2668
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,840
I think ultimately, I think that did happen,

2669
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,440
but I didn't even play it.

2670
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,920
And then I lost it, and I was sad for years.

2671
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,400
But then I think Ben, for Christmas one year,

2672
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,960
bought me a new copy of Legend of Dragoon,

2673
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,800
and with that, I finally beat the game.

2674
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:47,520
Did I?

2675
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,160
I think so.

2676
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,800
That's my recollection anyway.

2677
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,400
I vaguely remember that.

2678
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,320
That sounds like it might have happened.

2679
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,920
That's how I remember it happening.

2680
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,800
And I'm glad it happened, because it was good,

2681
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,040
and it's a great game, and literally save Legend of Dragoon.

2682
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,240
Please, bring them back.

2683
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,440
They're dying, and they deserve more.

2684
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,120
There's no GDQ.

2685
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,200
I would love to watch a speedrun of it.

2686
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,040
I would love to watch a GDQ, but there's none.

2687
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:14,640
There's like one speedrun video on YouTube of it,

2688
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,400
but it's just like some guy.

2689
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,480
And it's not that interesting,

2690
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:22,080
because the commentary is very low energy and sporadic.

2691
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,640
It doesn't strike me as a great game for speedrunning anyway.

2692
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,040
It would like the weird ways that the encounters work,

2693
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,720
and other stuff.

2694
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,600
Ah, I don't know.

2695
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,080
I don't know.

2696
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:31,600
All right.

2697
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,760
Well, you got plenty of suggestions there, folks.

2698
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:34,640
Play some Viggy games.

2699
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,600
Play the new Doom.

2700
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,240
It's good.

2701
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,200
I like it.

2702
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,240
Or the old Doom.

2703
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:38,960
That's also good.

2704
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:40,480
Okay.

2705
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,200
Play Kingdom Hearts.

2706
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:43,280
Ooh, now's a good time to play the good Kingdom Hearts.

2707
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,640
One, Chain of Memories.

2708
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:47,040
Two, and I guess I'll put three in there,

2709
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,720
now that there's good DLC for it.

2710
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,520
Skip everything else.

2711
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,640
Okay, we had more questions here.

2712
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,920
Let me see.

2713
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,040
How many more do we got?

2714
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,360
Three more total, but this is like two and one.

2715
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,800
So let's, we can do these real quick.

2716
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,320
I'm still, I'm being like,

2717
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,080
I've suddenly come over, been,

2718
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,800
been swept over with a wave of fatigue.

2719
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:05,120
Well, luckily.

2720
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:07,440
Which is one of the symptoms of the coronavirus.

2721
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:08,240
No.

2722
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,120
Write it out, Ben.

2723
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:10,320
We're getting there.

2724
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:10,720
Okay.

2725
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,680
Good news, everybody.

2726
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,200
Get ready to have fun,

2727
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,440
because it's riddled my ass Batman

2728
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,080
with the Scooby-Doo murder mystery files.

2729
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,200
He's calling in.

2730
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:21,680
Oh, and by the way, he asked me to remind everybody

2731
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,440
that canonically what's going on

2732
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,000
is that Johnny Bravo is playing

2733
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,720
who wants to be a PCP millionaire.

2734
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,080
And so that's what's happening

2735
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,280
when we last left our hero.

2736
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:32,960
He missed his chance

2737
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,320
because he didn't show up to the meet-ups

2738
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,440
to get his PC penny.

2739
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,120
Is that what, I'm sure that's true.

2740
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:37,840
Well, that's how,

2741
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,920
that's the easiest way to become a millionaire.

2742
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:40,320
That's true.

2743
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:40,480
That's true.

2744
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,400
A PCP millionaire specifically.

2745
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,800
So let's see how things go for our hero.

2746
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:45,200
Okay.

2747
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:45,920
Take it away.

2748
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,160
Go.

2749
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,640
Well, Johnny, would you like to continue?

2750
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,160
We've been away on break for a while.

2751
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:50,960
Is it like,

2752
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:51,920
lay it on me, brother.

2753
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,200
I really want to earn some money.

2754
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:54,080
Hoo-ha-ha.

2755
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,640
Take it, take it.

2756
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,000
Okay.

2757
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:56,880
Next question.

2758
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,120
Who is about to kill Johnny Bravo?

2759
01:55:59,120 --> 01:55:59,840
What are you talking about?

2760
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,320
Hoo-ha.

2761
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,040
Oh, fuck.

2762
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,040
Scooby-Doo-Doo.

2763
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,480
That's who.

2764
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,400
Where's my money?

2765
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,800
Scooby-Doo at gunpoint?

2766
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,480
I always knew I died this way.

2767
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,240
Stop stalling.

2768
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,200
Where's my money?

2769
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:18,560
Scooby-Doo, give yourself up.

2770
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,600
You're highly surrounded.

2771
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,280
Better be careful.

2772
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,360
I have one of my ass batman at gunpoint.

2773
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:24,960
Like Scoob?

2774
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,400
You don't have news, man?

2775
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,120
Raggy, I always knew you'd betray me.

2776
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,560
Hey, Scoob.

2777
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,960
Yeah, where do I ask Batman?

2778
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,520
Your plan has one fatal mistake.

2779
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:37,200
Oh, yeah?

2780
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:38,560
What would that be?

2781
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,440
Before you killed Johnny Bravo, he taught me karate.

2782
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,480
Hi-yah!

2783
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,600
Karate suplex.

2784
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:46,560
Well, well, Raggy.

2785
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,200
Take it away, boys.

2786
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,040
He was like, I would have gotten away with the two that weren't for you.

2787
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,000
Where are my ass batman?

2788
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,120
You meddling kids.

2789
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:56,400
Thank you.

2790
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:58,080
Thank you.

2791
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:01,200
To the next time for the exciting backstory of the predicament.

2792
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,760
And Scooby-Doo, mystery murder files.

2793
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,840
I'd have to know the backstory.

2794
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:12,000
I'd have to know the content.

2795
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,640
Yeah, I'm dying.

2796
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,840
Mystery murder files.

2797
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,220
What?

2798
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:19,520
That's got great news.

2799
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:25,520
The little full starts make this like elevated like seven rungs up the ladder of greatness.

2800
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,240
It's so true.

2801
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:28,240
It's so keep it going riddle my ass Batman.

2802
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:28,720
It's so weird.

2803
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,000
I think he wanted to come to the meet up but he couldn't do it for whatever reason.

2804
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,360
So we missed you, buddy.

2805
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,000
We missed you.

2806
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,480
What a shame.

2807
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,840
We have you in our thoughts and prayers.

2808
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:41,200
I had forgotten the joy of a riddle my ass Batman voice.

2809
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:42,080
They never fail.

2810
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,320
And so I forget it like with the Johnny Bravo thing.

2811
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:50,000
I think that was just called who wants to be a PCP millionaire.

2812
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,800
If I remember correctly.

2813
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,640
I just happened to have Johnny Bravo in it.

2814
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:57,840
But now the fact that it's called the Scooby-Doo murder mystery murder files.

2815
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,040
It's actually Scooby-Doo is doing the murder mystery.

2816
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,600
He is the criminal in these in these files.

2817
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,440
And I wonder if there'll be more.

2818
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:05,680
Right.

2819
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,640
Scooby-Doo sounded a lot like Batman.

2820
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,640
He did.

2821
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:10,880
Yeah.

2822
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:11,600
He did.

2823
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:14,400
He occasionally sounded a little bit like Batman.

2824
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,040
Sometimes.

2825
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,840
Sometimes.

2826
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,080
Okay.

2827
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,800
Say what he said.

2828
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,200
Racky.

2829
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,240
That's I've got good news.

2830
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:19,840
We heard a little bit of it there at the end.

2831
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:26,080
But we've been provided a full Scooby-Doo mystery murder theme song by riddle my ass Batman.

2832
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,640
So let's let's listen and enjoy.

2833
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,120
Take it away.

2834
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,520
Look out for Scooby-Doo.

2835
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,960
He's going to murder you.

2836
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,600
He's going to rape you and I see you Scooby-Doo and your Mr.

2837
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:38,560
Murder Crew.

2838
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:41,440
Look out for Scooby-Doo because he's going to murder you.

2839
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,800
Don't look back till you find a safer path.

2840
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,280
Scooby's wrath will be waiting there for you.

2841
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,280
Look out for Scooby-Doo.

2842
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:54,800
He's going to murder you.

2843
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,600
He's going to rape you in the butt.

2844
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,560
I see you Scooby-Doo and your Mr. Murder Crew.

2845
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,520
Look out for Scooby-Doo because he's going to murder you.

2846
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:13,760
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

2847
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,400
Scooby-Doo's going to murder you.

2848
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,200
Say it again.

2849
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:17,680
Yeah.

2850
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:20,640
More on-core.

2851
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:21,440
That was great.

2852
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,120
Is that the second OP?

2853
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,640
Maybe it is.

2854
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,920
Yeah, maybe it is.

2855
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,440
That's my favorite one for sure.

2856
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,280
Incredible.

2857
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,920
Keep it coming.

2858
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:30,960
Love it.

2859
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:31,920
All right.

2860
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,800
We've got one more, one more message and this one's coming in hot from an individual known as

2861
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,160
The Big Gay.

2862
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:39,200
Okay.

2863
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:41,040
Let's clear the floor and let them see them.

2864
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:41,840
From RCK?

2865
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,040
It could be.

2866
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,080
Let's find out.

2867
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:44,960
Take it away.

2868
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:45,520
Go.

2869
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:51,280
I am a big smelly gay demon and I hate everything good.

2870
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:57,520
That is why I hate the PCP dating sim releasing on April 1st.

2871
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:01,920
Don't play it unless you want to have a good time.

2872
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,400
Don't go to Twitter at PCP dating for updates.

2873
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,680
Don't download the game on April 1st.

2874
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:14,800
Especially don't live stream it if you're a PCP member.

2875
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,040
That would be terrible.

2876
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:21,200
You don't want to end up gay like me.

2877
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,440
That, that voice mail, that was from Oblivionfall.

2878
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,520
He told, he told me he was sending it.

2879
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,920
Classic, classic Big Gay.

2880
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,760
And so when you hear this.

2881
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:41,520
Five days, April 1st will be the release of the PCP dating sim according to this.

2882
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,880
Is Oblivionfall the Big Gay?

2883
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:47,920
It sounded like them snakes to me.

2884
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,040
It sounded like them snakes.

2885
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,760
I was thinking it sounded like a little like them snakes too.

2886
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,720
Is this just a coincidence that there's another guy called The Big Gay?

2887
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:59,200
I feel like it's a coincidence but I don't know for sure.

2888
02:00:59,200 --> 02:00:59,840
I'm not sure.

2889
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,680
Oh god, what a fucking quagmire.

2890
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:02,080
Indeed.

2891
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,880
Didn't the demo for the PCP dating sim come out last April 1st?

2892
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,960
That sounds right.

2893
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:09,760
It did.

2894
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:13,200
Yeah, and we all thought they were joking and it wasn't a real thing.

2895
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,080
That is true.

2896
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:18,480
You see, I was gonna say, let's not ignore the fact that they're releasing this quote

2897
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:23,440
unquote project on quote unquote April 1st, April Fool's Day.

2898
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,880
That's what we thought last time.

2899
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,360
Yeah, it is.

2900
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,720
But then it really happened.

2901
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,000
The joke then.

2902
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,200
The tweet literally said the joke was that they spent way too much time.

2903
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:31,680
Right, right.

2904
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,880
That was the joke then.

2905
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,560
Now the joke is that that was all a joke and none of it's actually coming out.

2906
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,600
There is no game.

2907
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:38,240
It's a first tapestry.

2908
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:39,760
Yeah, I mean, they swiped this joke.

2909
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:43,280
They said it would come out before Radcon 4 and that we could play it live.

2910
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,000
But they failed.

2911
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,800
That's okay, that's okay.

2912
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:45,600
They fucked it up.

2913
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,520
It's all a big joke.

2914
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,880
They're just gonna, they're gonna post.

2915
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,640
They're just buying time eternally now.

2916
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,760
They're just gonna post a PDF that you can't open.

2917
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,120
I won't be able to figure out how to open that.

2918
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:57,680
And that'll really quagmire my presidency.

2919
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:59,040
I'm very excited.

2920
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,280
I trust Oblivion to deliver this message.

2921
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,320
I believe that it's true, even though I don't have any proof or anything.

2922
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,000
There you go.

2923
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,400
April 1st people.

2924
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,440
We have only his word.

2925
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:08,880
Indeed.

2926
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,240
I assume on the behalf of...

2927
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:12,880
I don't know if Oblivion even worked with them to work on it.

2928
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,640
Maybe they just asked him to convey the message.

2929
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,520
I don't know.

2930
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,320
I have no idea.

2931
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,200
I don't even know if that was like his recording.

2932
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,480
Maybe he was like past it a lot.

2933
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,040
I don't know.

2934
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,400
I don't know what's going on.

2935
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:26,240
But April 4th people, go follow at its PCP...

2936
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,200
You mean dating.

2937
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:28,720
April 1st.

2938
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:29,760
April 1st, that's right.

2939
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,000
Which is gonna be five days after you hear this, people.

2940
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,280
So pretty soon.

2941
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,240
Oh god, it's upon us.

2942
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:35,520
It's upon us.

2943
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,920
We were just last episode saying like where the fuck is it?

2944
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,400
I don't consent, viewer.

2945
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,640
You're not allowed to fucking use my route.

2946
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,000
My route is off limits.

2947
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,560
It's for me and my future god-chosen, destined wife.

2948
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:52,960
Jennifer Diane Wright.

2949
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,760
Jennifer Diane Wright's aunt, yes.

2950
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,520
And Steven Lepisto.

2951
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,560
And Sandra Woodruff.

2952
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,120
Join the Collective.

2953
02:02:59,120 --> 02:02:59,760
And fucking...

2954
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,320
Ben's joining that Polly Amherst relationship.

2955
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,760
Whatever the fucking name was.

2956
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:06,240
The real life Borg cube over there.

2957
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:07,520
It's based.

2958
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,200
Well there you go, people.

2959
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,320
I'm pretty excited about it.

2960
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,200
That was our last voicemail update with the PCP dating sim.

2961
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:14,880
Very excited to see how that turns out.

2962
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,640
So check out it a couple days.

2963
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:17,920
Eldenath.

2964
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:20,080
Eldenath de Vilio, that was the fourth one.

2965
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,840
Who could forget that memorable character?

2966
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,600
All right, well that's it everybody.

2967
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,800
Hey, leave more voicemails.

2968
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,480
Speakpipelink is in the description.

2969
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,680
Keep them coming.

2970
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,680
We will be listening to them and rolling them out

2971
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:31,840
and enjoying them as you've seen here.

2972
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,080
And other than that, at...

2973
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:34,800
No, not at.

2974
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,400
It's patreon.com.

2975
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:39,920
Flash the procrastinators is where you need to go for all.

2976
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:41,360
Excuse me.

2977
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:44,560
The best PCP related bullshit.

2978
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,520
I think when you hear this...

2979
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:46,960
Bonus episodes.

2980
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,800
A bonus episode is coming out like a couple...

2981
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,720
Oh well it should be on April 1st.

2982
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,880
Which will be the day that the bonus...

2983
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,240
The fucking dating sim comes out.

2984
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,160
So get ready for that ladies and gentlemen.

2985
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,440
And there's like fucking 35 other ones.

2986
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,560
So what a deal.

2987
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,960
$5 a month or so.

2988
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:04,400
Give us money.

2989
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,160
We would be eternally grateful.

2990
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,000
And more and more PCP stuff from Radcon 4.

2991
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,480
We'll be rolling out as you will expect.

2992
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,880
So watch for updates on the Kickstarter page.

2993
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,120
I'm sure we'll be announcing and retweeting a lot of them

2994
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:19,760
on Twitter at TPCrastinators.

2995
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:22,400
So as always follow that for updates and stuff.

2996
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,920
And I think at some point I think we want to make available

2997
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:30,400
via purchase to those latecomers the like the bonus footage.

2998
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:32,480
We'll probably sell it for some amount.

2999
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,480
Kind of like we did with the Radcon 3 stuff.

3000
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,720
So if you missed out you may get a chance

3001
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,400
to catch some of it later on.

3002
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,400
But we'll we'll keep you posted about that.

3003
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,480
Probably be another thing on Gumroad or whatever.

3004
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,840
In any case that's going to do it.

3005
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,320
Cool.

3006
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,280
That's it for the episode.

3007
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,560
Sounds pretty base.

3008
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:49,040
Not bad.

3009
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:49,520
If yes.

3010
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,240
Ooh.

3011
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,520
Very little cringe.

3012
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,000
Ending the episode though.

3013
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,880
Totally cringe.

3014
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,520
That is cringe.

3015
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,080
Not base.

3016
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,640
In fact that's not three, four, five hours long.

3017
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,080
A pathetic two hours.

3018
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,760
Not not.

3019
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,640
Particularly base.

3020
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,920
That's all there is to say about it.

3021
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:04,880
Okay I gotta go.

3022
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:06,080
I gotta go play Doom.

3023
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:07,280
I gotta go work on videos.

3024
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,520
I gotta fight more bosses in Kingdom Hearts 3.

3025
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:10,800
Remind.

3026
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,400
Oh my god I love my life.

3027
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:13,760
And I love my body.

3028
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,920
Thanks everybody for donating to the Kickstarter

3029
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,040
and making Radcon 4 up.

3030
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,040
And we got more content to make for you.

3031
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,360
And we'll see you back next week with another episode.

3032
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:22,800
Bonus episode soon.

3033
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,440
That's it.

3034
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:24,800
All right see you then.

3035
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,000
Bye.

3036
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,440
Goodbye.

3037
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,320
Bye everyone.

3038
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:28,800
Thank you.

3039
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:29,760
Goodbye.

3040
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:43,280
Don't die.
