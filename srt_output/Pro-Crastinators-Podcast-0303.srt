1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:13,040
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,500
Okay welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast I guess we're going, I guess we're live, I

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,520
guess we're not live, this is pre-recorded.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,760
The pre-recorded Colin show, there was a bit, you know, there was a bit on the, you know,

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,240
There was a bit on Mr. Show called The Pre-Recorded Colin Show, which was about, it was David

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,440
Cross was the host of a show and like, just the whole show was just confusion over like

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,320
people calling in and leaving effectively voicemails thinking that the show was live.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,080
And so it's just a big like, people thinking they're talking live but he's responding

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,640
to them and it's just a series of responding to voicemails that like have not understood

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
the nature of the show and that's pretty much our voicemail segment.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
So you know, I feel like that was ahead of its time.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
That sounds pretty good.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
I like Mr. Show.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,000
Well it had its moments.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,600
It's actually kind of, a lot of it sucks in hindsight.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
But that's comedy.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,160
That's comedy.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm here Ben St. Gibbentake and Cheesy Manfredo is back.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,080
Hey, I'm back.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
With a vengeance.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, I'm like, I'm feeling an acute sense of like tiredness that like makes me want to

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,840
sneeze.

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,280
Like I woke, like I just got out of bed and like I want to be back in bed and that makes

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,640
my face feel like pinched up like I'm gonna, like I'm gonna sneeze, like my eyes are stinging.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,440
You just got out of bed?

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Yeah.

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,840
That's so interesting because I just got out of bed too right now.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh my God, we were in bed together.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,840
We were in bed together.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
We were homosexual.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
Were you here to hear first folks?

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
We was homosexual.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Okay.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Yeah.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Okay.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,000
So how was it with me?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
What the gay sex we do?

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Yes.

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Yeah.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
It was pretty all right.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
The problem was that your dick was just too massive for me.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Uh-oh.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
It didn't fit in my mouth.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
It didn't fit in my mouth.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
It was gonna say the same thing about you.

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
So neither of you could do anything.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,260
We were, yeah, we couldn't.

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Yeah, we couldn't.

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,880
Our dicks were so big we couldn't have gay sex.

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,320
So it's like, damn, I guess we got to go back to fucking women in the bud.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Like God intended.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Isn't there a show, I think Michelle tweeted something.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Were they fucking women in the bud?

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
No.

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Ew.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
No.

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,560
There's a show that's called My Husband's Too Big or My Husband Won't Fit.

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Is that real?

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
I think, yeah.

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,760
Is that TLC?

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,160
I think it's Chinese.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,440
There's like a Netflix show that's called My Husband Won't Fit.

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Maybe it's Korean.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,280
There's a, like, My Husband Won't Fit.

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,600
This sounds right up my alley.

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,520
And I haven't watched it, but I highly recommend it to anyone.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Won't, not a waste of your time.

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
I promise.

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,760
Kimiko and Kenichi meeting college, build a happy marriage together, but over time an

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,160
unusual problem fended to the server relationship.

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Oh, it's a drama.

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Give.

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Save us.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes.

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,920
My big announcement that even if you already know that my secret project was revealed to

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,480
be Pumpkin Alley, the fucking video game I'm making, wow.

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,800
I knew about it.

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
I knew about it.

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,720
I knew about it because I am a patron at patreon.com slash give and take also probably because

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,480
we're on the show together, but both, both reasons.

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,120
When did you first start talking about the secret project?

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Give.

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Do you remember?

85
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Because it feels like forever.

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
It has been a while.

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,960
You've been working on it for a year, but I don't remember when you started, like, talking

88
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
about it.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,240
I don't remember when I started talking about it.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,960
Maybe it was initially, well, the project started in January 2021, and I was like, it's

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,000
time to start, like, making a video game.

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,200
And I was like, that's what I'm going to do this year.

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,160
And like the initial idea was to make some sort of demo by the end of the year.

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,280
Or well, I think that became the goal because I didn't know how long anything would take.

95
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
And it seemed like it was possible.

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
It wasn't quite possible, but then early this year, it was finally ready to be revealed.

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:01,240
So it's been, yeah, literally a year and a month or two since I started working on it.

98
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,960
There was a bunch of months in the middle of last year where I was sick and unable to

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
work.

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
We're both game devs now.

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,480
That's true.

102
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,120
We're all game dev people.

103
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,160
I guess this isn't Digi's anime podcast anymore.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
This is Digi's podcast.

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,760
This is now video.

106
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,480
I was trying to call you Gibb and take, but I pronounced it video game.

107
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,920
That's my new name.

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm changing my name.

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
To give and take is now a dead name.

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm called video game now.

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
That's my new name.

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,080
No, it's still spelled Gibb and take, but the G is pronounced as a V and the B is pronounced

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,560
as a D and etc.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,520
And the T is pronounced as a G and so on in that order.

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
We're Gibb and takes video game podcast now.

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Yes.

117
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,360
You heard of Neo pronouns.

118
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Here are Neo dead names.

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,240
My pronouns are video slash gay.

120
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Yes.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes.

122
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,360
So, yeah, if you have not heard and this is your first time, go to link in the description

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
pumpkinali on itch.io.

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Free demo.

125
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Right.

126
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Link in the description.

127
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
It's a free demo to play.

128
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I would like everyone to play it in the world.

129
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
I don't think I'm going to do that later today.

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,440
I have a question at the top of my mind, seeing the trailer for a pumpkin alley.

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,760
Do I have to have red bell jade to get this game?

132
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,120
No, this, this is the, the origin story of the friendship between punk and alley.

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,920
They are two characters, they meet each other.

134
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,560
That's the story of the game that I have roughly lined out.

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Right.

136
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Right.

137
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Right.

138
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
So, so it's a, it's a prequel.

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Right.

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
It's a prequel.

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I saw you.

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,840
I posted a drawing of a Tiki on Twitter.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
Is Tiki going to be in the game?

144
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
No, probably not.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,720
No, because they need Tiki and bell jade.

146
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
So, no, I wouldn't make any sense.

147
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,520
I just felt like drawing her because it's been a while.

148
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Yeah.

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Yeah.

150
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,080
The, the, the adventure of punk going out into the world, finding alley-oop and becoming

151
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,720
friends on an adventure.

152
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I have it.

153
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,680
Details to be determined and also I don't want to spoil anything.

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Well, okay.

155
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Yeah.

156
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
I mean, don't...

157
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
About the story at least.

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I could talk about some things.

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,440
Don't answer if it's spoilers, but what's up with fairy bits?

160
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,800
Why fairy, why are they fairy bits?

161
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Because that's, that's what you collect in the, in the game, by the way.

162
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah, it's kind of gay.

163
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
It's kind of...

164
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah.

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
What?

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Why, why gay though?

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Well, it's an allegory.

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,520
You see, they're gay.

169
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Fascinating.

170
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,720
No, it's initially the, the, when I was writing up like the, the story and the, I was thinking

171
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,480
of the locations, the enemies, what you do physically and then also the story that carries

172
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
you through.

173
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,400
Initially, I wasn't sure about what collectibles there would be and we decided fairy bits.

174
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,800
So there is lore, but I'm not sure how it fits into the lore I already had planned for

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
like the enemies.

176
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Very...

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
There's lore for that.

178
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Okay.

179
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,440
Now tell me, tell me if I'm completely off base.

180
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,320
I was, I strongly, I got the feeling that pumps, pumps health bar looks like fairy

181
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,040
bits and I, and I was so much that like when I took damage, I thought collecting fairy

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,480
bits was going to restore her health.

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
It didn't.

184
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
I don't know.

185
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,840
Are those, are those connected?

186
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Is there a reason?

187
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Is that bad game?

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Is that bad game design?

189
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
It is, it's definitely bad game design.

190
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Definitely.

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Bad games.

192
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Well, the thing with the demo, right?

193
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Yeah.

194
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,280
Everything could change when the final game is released.

195
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Yeah.

196
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,840
So if, like, there was no particular reason they're the same color, it was just sort of

197
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
like, that's a cool color.

198
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm a lore guy.

199
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Like that for her health.

200
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm a lore guy.

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm always looking for lore connections.

202
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,960
When it comes to like the actual thing, lore connections will be considered with every

203
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
design element.

204
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Yeah.

205
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Yeah.

206
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,560
We just sort of like, initially the, we were like, I wasn't sure how fast things could

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,880
be done, but my brother, Charlie, he's a programmer.

208
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,000
He went to Game Dev University School.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,720
He went to Gaming High School.

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,520
He went to Gaming High School, became a big gamer.

211
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Lucky.

212
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,840
And he's just sort of always interested in programming things, so he's very good at

213
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
that.

214
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,880
And so like the first month of working on it, we got quite a lot like of the assets and

215
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
stuff working.

216
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Things that took a long time were like the camera and movement and a bit of the animation.

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
The fairy bits were like one of the first things he made.

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Just like, I'll make this little code.

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,920
So when you go near them, they jump up and then swoop around to you.

220
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,680
And it's like, it's really nice looking.

221
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah.

222
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,040
So there wasn't much design into like, like from my end, like what they're supposed to

223
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,600
look like yet.

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
So you know, who knows.

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
That's pretty epic.

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
You just made them look.

227
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,480
You did, well, he did some art and you did, but you did like most of the art.

228
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,600
I think the credits list him as doing like textures.

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Shelley makes most of the models and things like the trees and like the floor, like cubes

230
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,520
that you can like copy paste and make different shapes with.

231
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,840
He drew the textures for that while he was muddling them because it was easier than me

233
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,680
like getting a UV map sent to me and then painting something on.

234
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,880
Yeah.

235
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,000
So so those and they're pretty good.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,800
And I did like the textures for the bush and the flame particle things and the health bar.

237
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,720
And I mean, you can tell, I think, well, things that I've drawn.

238
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Yeah.

239
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,080
And then I animated punk with my 3D animation knowledge.

240
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,040
So this is a demo, right?

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
And this is like how long is this demo?

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,000
It took me it took me maybe an hour to like it took me less than an hour to like

243
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,520
basically explore the whole thing.

244
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,520
But then it took me like another hour to find all 250 fairy bits.

245
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,520
How long do you imagine the full game to begin?

246
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm hoping it'll be like.

247
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:33,200
Because you can't like aim so high that you need like a 10 years or like to hire a whole studio.

248
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,560
I don't really prepare to do all that stuff.

249
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,160
So it's going to be like a sort of small ish game, maybe five hours.

250
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,720
That's not small for an indie game.

251
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,640
Like for the sort of game you want, that's like pretty good, I think.

252
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
OK, when is the animated series going to come out?

253
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,560
That's what I'm wondering where the real money is at.

254
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,040
Moichan dicing.

255
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
Well, Chen dies.

256
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Well, I mean, when can I go into a when can I go into a hot topic

257
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,080
and buy my own punk marriage?

258
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,040
That's what I'm wondering.

259
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,280
Well, actually, I was I forgot I had notes.

260
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,040
I had some I had I had a couple of notes to complain for the for the devs.

261
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,000
I said, like, hey, I got so I got a bone to pick with whoever designed this piece of shit.

262
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,160
Oh, yeah, I. All right.

263
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,480
So I gave I was first complaint.

264
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
There's no gay sex.

265
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,120
Where is all the gay sex?

266
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,920
Give OK, it's family friendly.

267
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
Obviously, I can't do that.

268
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I can't do that. Such a such a product.

269
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,880
OK, well, I guess I won't be playing it.

270
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
I guess I won't be playing it then.

271
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm not it. You can figure it out.

272
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
It's violence. It's violence against me.

273
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,920
All right. Yeah.

274
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,160
I I missed I'm I guess at some point in this,

275
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,480
I will probably have to say like what the places were that I found stuff.

276
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
So if you don't want to like if you want to find everything in the game,

277
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
I guess don't don't listen to play.

278
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,280
Play the game right now.

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,600
It is a unsubscribe from the PCP.

280
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,480
Go play the game.

281
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,960
The game is very easy and fun and good.

282
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
And there's a few little glitches.

283
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,200
But yeah, the main glitch that I found was well, actually,

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
it was it was when I was fucking around.

285
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,320
I spent a lot of time after I got to basically the end.

286
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,560
And OK, OK, here was here was my play experience.

287
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,920
I progressed more or less.

288
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,320
OK, I kind of was just like went past the big area

289
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
with the big like hollow tree with the mushroom stairs.

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,760
That's sort of like one of the main areas.

291
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,480
But I kind of just like accidentally like missed it and kind of went by it.

292
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,600
And I sort of progressed directly to what I guess would be the last area,

293
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,800
the area with like the angry mushroom that throws mushrooms at you.

294
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,760
And I got there and then I collected all the fairy bits.

295
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,560
And I was like, OK, there's definitely I definitely missed an area.

296
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,360
But while I'm here, I saw up on the cliff, there's a doorway.

297
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
You know what I'm talking about?

298
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,240
Like up high, there's like an alley grotto doorway.

299
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,440
Yes, little caves that you can go into.

300
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,640
And I was like, oh, hmm, how do we get up there?

301
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
And maybe and maybe this is on me.

302
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,320
But I spent I spent a not inconsiderable amount of time

303
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,320
trying to find ways to jump up the sides of the mountain

304
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,720
to jump around on the up like

305
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,160
mountaintops sort of ringing around the area in order to jump up

306
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,600
and get up to that like high up door zone.

307
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
And I did it. I did it.

308
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,520
The main glitch that I found in the game was when I was jumping around

309
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,680
in areas when I wasn't supposed to be, I would slide down

310
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,520
certain parts of the mountain and I would be caught in the geometry.

311
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,920
Yeah, sort of in between two slopes where I would just be falling forever.

312
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,440
And I would have to use the restart command.

313
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,560
Yeah, it's it's funny.

314
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,320
There's lots of people who have jumped around on on like

315
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
not technically out of bounds.

316
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,000
Like I've never liked games that have invisible walls.

317
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,760
But because of that, I think because of the lack of invisible walls,

318
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,520
people thought you should go to places that you shouldn't.

319
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,760
And.

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,520
When it comes to like the slipping down.

321
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,400
It's it's determined we're going to redo a lot of things like that.

322
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,680
Because like from the ground up, they're just sort of fundamentally

323
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
not not good.

324
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,200
But like it you land and then it checks the angle of the polygon

325
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,240
you're standing on.

326
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,520
And if it's certainly if it's a certain height, you know, slip.

327
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,080
But there's like a little grace period where you can sort of jump

328
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,440
because some some other thing was interacting with that.

329
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,800
And we needed it to jump sometimes it's a bit messy.

330
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,240
So, uh, mm-hmm, there's work to do in like understanding level design

331
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,920
to like make it clear to the player where you should be going

332
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,360
and where is no go please.

333
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,800
And also just making it harder to do it.

334
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I yeah, I was able to get up on the side mountains and jump around.

335
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,160
And I actually got up to before I even found

336
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,320
well, it turned out I wasn't really supposed to go up there

337
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,560
because I got up to that higher up doorway

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,160
and you can't actually go into it.

339
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,120
And I was like darn.

340
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
But then I was like, well, that's kind of on me

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,400
because I hadn't collected all the bits yet.

342
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,560
I shouldn't be trying to get up to like secret areas.

343
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,640
So I went back and I collected the other bits

344
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,360
and then I came and I explore the area some more.

345
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,560
And I found down below there's the actual entrance

346
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,920
where you're supposed to go in and then there's bits in there.

347
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,960
And then you go through it and there's the exit

348
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,640
and you come out, you come out that upper door

349
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
and then you you drop down and Pump is waiting there for you.

350
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,720
So I was like, OK, got it.

351
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,480
And then, yeah, I went back and I explored and I had

352
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,680
and I had all but 12 fairy bits.

353
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,160
I had 238 fairy bits and I'm like, there's 12 left.

354
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,640
And I went back to all the previous areas

355
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,120
and I and I roamed around and I was like, damn it, I can't find them.

356
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm sure there's there's a I was sure

357
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,880
that I was looking for an an alley cave, a grotto, I called them.

358
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,000
So I'm jumping around and I'm looking and I'm looking for caves

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,520
and I can't find any.

360
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,600
And the way that I ended up finding it was I was jumping around up.

361
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,400
I was I was again, I was like, I can't find anything here.

362
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,520
Maybe if I get if I get a higher vantage point.

363
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
So I was jumping around on mountains

364
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,400
that I definitely wasn't supposed to be on.

365
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,040
And just by happenstance through from above,

366
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,120
near the starting area, I saw a little crack in between like the rocks.

367
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,160
I saw the glimpse after like an hour.

368
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,040
I saw the glimpse of a fairy bit and I jumped down

369
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,160
and I fell down into a little not a not an alley grotto,

370
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
but a little side cave.

371
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,560
And I realized there was like in the beginning area, there's a little

372
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,880
sort of like a little crack in the rock that you can go through to a little

373
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,720
a little secret area that has some cool like unique flowers and stuff in them.

374
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960
And I was like, got it.

375
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
So so I had missed that on my first go

376
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,560
and I found it sort of in the wrong way by jumping around,

377
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,360
jumping around on rocks.

378
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,480
But that was fun.

379
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,520
It worked. It worked out what you're saying.

380
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,400
So what you're saying is this game was built wrong.

381
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,640
I would say it's built different.

382
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,640
It's just built different. That's all different.

383
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,120
Not wrong. Not wrong. Just different.

384
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,920
But while I was hunting those last 12 bits, I found

385
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,840
what I call the surprise lizards because I found I found four of them.

386
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,200
And I know there's a fifth one that I didn't find.

387
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Steel Viper on Twitter posted there's a red lizard that I didn't find.

388
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,720
But I found a green one, yellow and blue and purple one.

389
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,040
I found four of five, maybe more of these lizards that when you take their picture,

390
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,400
they make a little they make what sounds to me like the little metal gear

391
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,640
alert sound. Oh, yeah.

392
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,080
That's why that's what it sounded like.

393
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,240
And I was OK. Oh, they're like surprised.

394
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,840
It's like a startle. It's a surprise lizard, a surprised lizard,

395
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,360
surprise lizard, a video, a video game reference in my video game.

396
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,960
No, no way.

397
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,240
It wasn't a reference, I guess it's just a coincidence.

398
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,320
Yeah, as a reference.

399
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
I think it's a reference.

400
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,120
I'm going to put that down as an Easter egg.

401
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,040
Yeah. Put that down in the week.

402
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,960
Yeah, the week is going to be like, you know,

403
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,920
these lizards sound is taken from metal gear solid.

404
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,520
The first the first one was, I think,

405
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,080
the the yellow one who's on the back of a rock.

406
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,800
And I was like, oh, that's neat.

407
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,960
Many people found that one.

408
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,920
Yeah, I was like, oh, that's neat.

409
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,360
And I took a picture and it made a little boing sound.

410
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,360
And I was like, oh, oh, oh, now we're cooking.

411
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,560
All right. Yeah.

412
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
How many are there? I got it.

413
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,800
I got to know how many there are.

414
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,200
Tell us all the tips and tricks for us.

415
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,880
I actually, I actually forget.

416
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,280
I think there's six.

417
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,760
Shit. Shit.

418
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,480
They're secret lizards.

419
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,560
You should make.

420
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,440
Collect them all.

421
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
It's been fun seeing, seeing how, like,

422
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,880
people have varying levels of, like.

423
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Like varying degrees of finding the secrets.

424
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,360
People who find the one lizard, usually the one behind the rock,

425
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,000
they're like, oh, I found the lizard.

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,600
Yeah.

427
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
And they don't know those other ones.

428
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,480
I think the second one I saw was in the per,

429
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,960
because there's, I think there's three

430
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
alley grottos and in the one that's purple, I remembered,

431
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
I think I remembered when I found that yellow one,

432
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,160
I remembered that I had, I was looking everywhere

433
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,080
for, I was looking everywhere for the last 12 bits.

434
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,040
And I went back into the alley grotto that's all purple

435
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,520
and I remembered, wait a minute,

436
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,120
I think I remember seeing something on the ceiling here

437
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,680
and I looked up and sure enough was like, yes, I was right.

438
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,480
There is another lizard up on the ceiling.

439
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,000
And I took another picture of it and it made the sound.

440
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
I was like, yes.

441
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,120
My exploration has been rewarded.

442
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
Intrinsically rewarded.

443
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,640
I mean, it didn't, didn't give me anything, but that's OK.

444
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
It was the joy of discovery.

445
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Yes.

446
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,680
Yeah.

447
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,400
I mean, the biggest problem is that no Xbox achievement

448
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,520
was awarded for finding each lizard.

449
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,920
That's my big complaint, too.

450
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,240
The little achievements don't show up.

451
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
You haven't even played it.

452
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm playing it right now.

453
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,640
What are you talking about?

454
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm playing it right now.

456
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
You're not playing it.

457
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,120
Oh, no, I'll play it, I'll play it.

458
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,680
Just like I'll eventually play the booze game

459
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,920
and just like eventually I'll play Ben's game, you know,

460
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,400
it's going to eventually happen.

461
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,280
Well, unlike unlike the booze game and Ben's game,

462
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,000
my game is in three dimensions.

463
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,480
That's a little too much from my eyes.

464
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
I can't play anything.

465
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,720
Yeah, I already live in a three dimensional world.

466
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,720
Why don't I look into another three dimensional world?

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,760
It's it's too much effort, really, you ask me.

468
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,080
Fortunately, fortunately, Phantom's Revenge.

469
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,200
The Phantom's Revenge is is is better.

470
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,480
It might lack the third dimension, but it's it's not a demo.

471
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
It's a finish. It's it's it's it.

472
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
There's no no more potential.

473
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
There's no more nothing else to summon.

474
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,800
You've you've completely wrung it dry.

475
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,640
I have wrung it dry.

476
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
It's actually it's very frustrating.

477
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,760
I'm very frustrating because you beat me as I

478
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,200
as it has been looking increasingly likely that you were going to.

479
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,360
And it makes me really mad because Phantom's Revenge is done.

480
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,240
It has been done for weeks, maybe more than a month now.

481
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,640
And I'm just and I'm just drawing panels.

482
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
This week I am drawing just last night I was drawing.

483
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm drawing the final scene, not not not the end scene, not the ending,

484
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,720
but the the final scene of Simon punishment that I had envisioned in my head.

485
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm drawing that and it feels weird to finally be drawing it after I imagined it for so long.

486
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,160
But I'm drawing that.

487
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,960
And so I'm like, I just

488
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm so close to being able to post it, but I can't post it.

489
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,080
I can't post it until it's all done.

490
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,000
How does it feel getting feel like your wife?

491
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,520
All the video game play as gay sex.

492
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,800
I'll tell you that much.

493
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,240
They'll never play another video game.

494
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
Elden Rings out.

495
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,480
You beat Elden Ring.

496
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,240
Oh, my God.

497
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,720
And now I'm going to be behind Elden Ring.

498
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,280
And now everybody's talking about Elden Ring.

499
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,240
You'll play you'll play you'll beat Elden Ring in a day.

500
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,800
Didn't it just come out?

501
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
No, I made Elden Ring.

502
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah, that's that's an alley was the demo for Elden.

503
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
That's a lie, maybe.

504
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
That's maybe a lie.

505
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,040
I don't know.

506
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,920
I don't I don't play.

507
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,960
I never Elden Elden Ring.

508
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
I haven't even played Demon Souls.

509
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,800
I can't I can't really play that one.

510
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,440
I can't jump right into the franchise.

511
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,200
Elden Ring looks pretty cool, I guess it looks.

512
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,320
I never played I never played Breath of the Wild, but I really do.

513
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,200
I think that the whole open world, the way that Breath of the Wild

514
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,360
does the open world stuff is pretty neat.

515
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,040
And I think it's probably cool because I've heard that the Elden Ring

516
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,920
is like Dark Souls, but in a Breath of the Wild open world.

517
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,760
Which is pretty cool, cool idea there, which is so funny because I thought

518
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,400
Breath of the Wild was like the Dark Soul of Legend of Zelda.

519
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
I mean, it kind of is.

520
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a little bit of a circle.

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Is it?

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,120
I swear I heard someone say that.

523
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,440
Yeah, I haven't heard or something like that.

524
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,920
That Breath of the Wild is the Dark Souls of Zelda.

525
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,200
Wait, I didn't Dark Souls.

526
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,520
Wait, I didn't Dark Souls start the whole like, oh, you can just walk up

527
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,280
to the final boss if you want to.

528
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,080
I mean, not exactly.

529
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,480
Not really, no.

530
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,200
I think the connection is that people used to say that Dark Souls

531
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,280
is like Legend of Zelda, but realistic.

532
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah, Dark Souls, like the most direct lineage of Dark Souls combat

533
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,040
is to like Ocarina of Time, like Lock on Z targeting.

534
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,160
Like, Dark Souls is like a direct ancestor of that anyway.

535
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:41,000
OK, so basically Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of Zelda, I would say

536
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,120
it would be a more accurate comparison.

537
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,360
Is it like a bad game or take to say that, like, this is probably going

538
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,280
to get a lot of people mad with it.

539
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,720
And the people who hate me are going to hate me more after I say this.

540
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,440
But you don't want to offend those people.

541
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,880
I especially don't want to offend those, I don't want to offend the hate

542
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,560
fandom that big Twitter artist has.

543
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,920
But yeah, all these all these like from soft games

544
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,320
look like the same to me.

545
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,160
Is that is that is that bad to say?

546
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
They all just look this.

547
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
No, I agree.

548
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,800
I the the the yeah.

549
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,440
You're talking like I mean that I could ring.

550
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,280
A round and ring looks like Dark Souls.

551
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,880
Yeah, like exactly the same thing that I haven't played it.

552
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,320
So all these games have this kind of like

553
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,160
gray, kind of like, I want to say edgy filters.

554
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
It has like some sort of filter over them.

555
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,200
Like all the games seem to have this filter.

556
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
You might even call it a style or something.

557
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,560
It's it's supposed to be like Dour and Depressing.

558
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Yeah, like things are fucked.

559
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,520
Here's a sword.

560
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,480
Like that's the idea of like of all the the Souls series is like things are

561
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,960
fucked. Here's a sword.

562
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,600
Also, you're probably decrepit and is like it's really sad.

563
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,440
You're going to die.

564
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,880
You're going to die one day in that day is today.

565
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,920
Isn't like every so like it makes sense that there'd be a lot of grays.

566
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,760
But I'd like it to be like a pink one.

567
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,200
Yeah, why is there going to be a pink one?

568
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
He is like my favorite color.

569
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,600
I keep saying I keep saying they need to make they make armored corps.

570
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,200
They should make a Souls like where you're a mech.

571
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,960
They should make armored bore.

572
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,840
Oh, my God.

573
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,400
They should make one about being mechs.

574
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,600
And instead of like weapons and armor, you're equipping fucking mech mech parts,

575
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
treads and rocket launchers.

576
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,240
I don't know.

577
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,320
It could be pretty cool if you ask me.

578
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,920
Instead of sorceries and wood and pyromancy, you got guns.

579
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,760
I don't know.

580
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,320
Why not?

581
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,080
I want like the I want like Dark Soul, which I never played to have

582
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,400
like a Dragon Quest aesthetic, which I never played.

583
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,280
That's that's what I want.

584
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,680
I aesthetically, they do look pretty similar.

585
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,120
And I'm not like I'm not super into like the way they look.

586
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,920
They look fine.

587
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,400
I can tell Dark Souls to a part because Dark Souls to looks worse.

588
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Yeah.

589
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Dark Souls to looks like Goofy air.

590
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
That's that's funny.

591
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000
There's a few nice places in Dark Souls to it's not like overall.

592
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,920
Yeah, overall.

593
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,800
I don't know exactly.

594
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,480
It's just no, it's the models.

595
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,240
Different feelings.

596
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,400
Something about the like the character model

597
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,080
and maybe the enemy models just looks.

598
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,120
So I feel like maybe it looks cartoonier.

599
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,680
And so I don't know.

600
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,840
I don't ever heard that that's before game, but that sounds interesting.

601
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,600
Yeah, I remember thinking when you put when you have like a lightning weapon,

602
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,600
the way that in Dark Souls to like when you apply lightning

603
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,960
or something to your weapon, it just it doesn't just have like a lightning bolt

604
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,720
effect like an electrified effect.

605
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,440
It glows.

606
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,920
It turns like a stupid like bright primary color like, oh, it's yellow now.

607
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,680
It's like, I hate that.

608
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,920
I feel like all of them do that a little bit.

609
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,320
No, Dark Souls one, maybe I mean, I didn't play I haven't played three.

610
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,720
Dark Souls one, it doesn't turn your sword like yellow

611
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
when you make it when you use a, you know, gold pine resin on it or whatever.

612
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,480
It gives it like a little thunderbolts coming off.

613
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Yeah, yeah, I haven't noticed that.

614
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Stood out to me, not in a great way.

615
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
Anyway, who cares about Elden Ring?

616
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,240
Yeah, if you got any more game development thoughts on that,

617
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,880
I have many things to say because it's been like, I don't know.

618
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,200
Yeah, that I've been like talking about it, but not talking about it.

619
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Yeah, have people found everything in the game that you like have set up

620
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,040
or there's some more secrets that are that lay in the game

621
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,160
that people haven't stumbled into yet.

622
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,000
I haven't seen anybody who's found all the lizards

623
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,360
and aside from that, there is something that nobody has figured out yet.

624
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,320
Really? OK.

625
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,160
There's an aspect of the game that nobody has figured out yet.

626
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,000
Can you and it's a little obscure.

627
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,840
So that's all I'm telling you about that one.

628
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,040
It's going to be funny.

629
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
It's going to be cool if anyone finds it.

630
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,360
Can you? OK, I don't.

631
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Can you be any more specific than aspect?

632
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Uh, is it like a I don't know.

633
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,640
Is it like a little scrambler?

634
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,360
Well, is a scrambler going to show up?

635
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
It's all right. Here's here's what it's not.

636
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,040
It's not like a physical location in the game that's hard to reach.

637
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,920
It's nothing like that. Is it like, I don't know.

638
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,360
My mind goes to like, is there is the mechanic?

639
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,800
Is there like, is there like a backwards long jump?

640
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,640
No, it's not like a movement thing, either.

641
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,680
That would be funny if we made like movement controls

642
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,880
that didn't like was so hard to figure out that nobody would ever use this.

643
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,240
Oh, I got it. There's a there's a what do you call them?

644
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,600
Coupes, there's QPUs. There's QPUs.

645
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,520
You can you can QPU misalign yourself in parallel world.

646
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,320
That's right.

647
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
If you get stuck when you're in the full animation, you stay there.

648
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,120
You go parallel universe.

649
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,080
You build up speed.

650
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,520
You build up speed for 12 hours until you you warp to the next world down below.

651
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
People have made that joke.

652
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,640
It does kind of look like you could build up speed.

653
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,120
Yeah, because because because you're continually falling.

654
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,800
You're stuck in the falling animation. I did.

655
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,600
I almost got.

656
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, I was jumping around in mountains

657
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,360
and I got pumped stuck in the between two ledges, infinite falling.

658
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,360
And Ali looked normal and I wanted to get Ali

659
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,280
to take a picture of pump in that state.

660
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,040
But I think Ali was also considered to be falling.

661
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,920
So I couldn't get her to go into the the take a picture.

662
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,080
Did she have her arms up?

663
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,400
Was she a falling animation?

664
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,720
She didn't know she looked normal.

665
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
She no, I remember thinking she did not look like she was falling,

666
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,440
but she could not take her phone out either.

667
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,200
So it didn't work out.

668
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,160
If you can control Ali, you can walk around.

669
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,840
You should be able to use the phone.

670
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Um, I think I could maneuver her a little bit.

671
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,160
But she was she was also stuck in the left.

672
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, she didn't.

673
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,560
But I could sort of move her.

674
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,200
She could sort of like, well, that makes sense.

675
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,360
Wiggle her a bit from left to right.

676
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
She's got a thing.

677
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,400
She's got a thing where, like, if she's moving too fast or.

678
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,480
Or something, she'll you'll be forced out of the phone mode.

679
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,520
Or I think I haven't tried this.

680
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,840
I think it's you you throw Ali up.

681
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,320
No, no, that wouldn't work.

682
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,120
There's something something to do with, like, no, when you.

683
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah, you can pick up and if you didn't know, if you didn't know,

684
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,560
you can pick up and throw Ali open.

685
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,920
She bounces like a bouncy ball against objects and it's funny.

686
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,400
But, like, if she's using her phone and she gets thrown,

687
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,760
but she wouldn't be.

688
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,160
You wouldn't break her phone and then you can't use that for no more.

689
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,440
She she's forced out of the phone mode for various little reasons

690
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
like that, I think.

691
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,680
It's just the main thing I I don't know.

692
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,600
I don't know if this is an intentional bit of like, developer comedy.

693
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,560
Or or just bad conveyance.

694
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,680
But it's probably the second different thing.

695
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm talking about the first Ali grotto that I found.

696
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
There's a sign right outside of it

697
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,520
that says you can return to pump at any time by pressing.

698
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:43,320
I think it is shift I didn't try it, but I came back later and when you when Ali goes into the grotto

699
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,240
No, you cannot you can't you can't actually can't do it while you're while she's in the cave

700
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,600
Only when she's out in the overall which makes sense

701
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,320
And I get why you wouldn't want because if you could do that then you would become pump again

702
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,000
And you would be stuck without Ali. She'd be back in the in the cave

703
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,160
Yeah, the the the reason we did that was because when Ali is way away from punk

704
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,560
She'll teleport to her if you're playing as punk. Yeah, and it was like confusing and difficult to like account for

705
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,560
Ali being in the cave and if you accidentally switch back to punk and then suddenly Ali like teleports to you as punk

706
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,240
You'll lose every all progress you had in the cave and we didn't want that so we have like cave zones where

707
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,960
Ali is unable to switch back. Yeah, he has a little moment and then she gets out

708
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
we might rework that because

709
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,560
I

710
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,080
Mean funny, I guess that you are immediately told you can switch back. Don't worry about it and you actually I think it's fine

711
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
You're in there. It didn't like I mean

712
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,600
if I

713
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:51,080
It would not it would not have frustrated me. I would have been like. Oh, well, whatever lol now. I get it

714
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,440
It's fine. I'll just go back out this door. Okay

715
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,360
See ya

716
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,080
Yeah, people said Ali. It's a little too slow. I think we're gonna increase her speed

717
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,380
It's not so much of a slot. She's pretty slow. I didn't I didn't find it too frustrating

718
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Yeah, but like

719
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Obviously things like this is

720
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,720
We wanted to have like a slice of like all the different aspects of game development game

721
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,680
Mechanics that you could interact with and Ali going into little caves

722
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,040
Not all of them are planned to be like that size

723
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,960
Some of them might be a bit longer more involved

724
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,020
Or there might be like a puzzle involved where you have to be Ali and punk and switch between them or something

725
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,560
so

726
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
the

727
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,000
things about like

728
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,400
Playing as the character need to be fun. We're thinking of giving Ali a little jump as well

729
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,520
Not like a big jump, but just something so the tiny little

730
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,080
Things on the floor don't get an array. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

731
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Yeah, she can't move

732
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,880
Just can't move at all

733
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,240
So, but I mean that's that's that's character design. What is um when is shovel night gonna show up in the game?

734
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,220
This is an indie game after all right, we're gonna

735
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,600
We're gonna have a shovel where and night he comes in he's like hey

736
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,080
Do you want some cheap shit and you buy hey?

737
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:22,760
Do you want to buy a Chippendales rescue Rangers on the Game Boy Advance like where you want to play shitty games?

738
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I

739
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,000
Says that and then Ali it's like yeah, I got a GBA adapter on my phone

740
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,320
And then you can play Chippendale in in and pumpkin alley. That's a intended feature that is definitely not been just made

741
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,880
Yeah, you the game the game the game comes with an emulator

742
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,040
You can you can play any any like Super Nintendo or NES emulator you can play it in the game

743
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:57,360
In yeah on on elliops in elliops phone mode like far away from the screen like in vertical

744
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Yeah, like terrible resolution

745
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,320
In in like low low lower colors can converted to like cyan cyan and pink and yellow

746
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,700
Yeah, good pretty epic. See him. See I see him like a bee

747
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
That's pretty epic

748
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,960
It was pretty epic any any more gamer questions you got forget those are all those are all my notes

749
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Those are all my complaints

750
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,720
I'm trying to think if there was any

751
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,040
I what did you like about it? What did I like about it?

752
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,120
Um, I liked running around like Spyro the dragon. I like Spyro the dragon. You know what? Yeah, you know

753
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,520
You know what I didn't like actually here's a good one. I think that I think that that what did you like about it?

754
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,960
Nothing. Here's some stuff that sucks. Um, I think the the

755
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,240
The plants burning burning the plants was a little bit. I didn't like realize they were burning until they weren't like later

756
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,800
I feel like the difference could be like more dramatic. I don't know. It took me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I

757
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,680
Had to kind of be like are these what did I do anything by that? Um, yeah

758
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
I

759
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't know. That's it. My minor minor gripe

760
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,920
Yes, it's it's to do with them. There's like a layer

761
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
for the thorns and the grass

762
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,320
Where like I had to make a layer of a gradient and

763
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,960
The color of the gradient determines what order it gets like burned away

764
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
in the and sort of like

765
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,440
Like if you burn a thorn bush, it'll like shrink and then there'll be like embery bits

766
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,240
Yeah, and it'll it'll follow that that mat or whatever you call it

767
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,720
Yeah, but for the grass I kind of fucked up the gradient a little bit

768
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,520
And so it sort of doesn't do much at first and then then quite quickly goes to nothing. Yeah, okay

769
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,560
So it looks like nothing's happening, but yeah, we're gonna redo the grass. Yeah

770
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,920
What's a little I mean the grass doesn't even like do anything so like whatever it doesn't even matter if it's there or not

771
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,080
Yeah, people like burning it. Yeah, some people were saying

772
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,240
Why isn't there rupees in this? Why isn't there stuff in this?

773
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,920
and I think we were thinking of doing that, but it was just sort of like

774
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
quite late in

775
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,000
Like we wanted to get the demo out

776
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,960
There's lots of little bits that we could have like spent maybe another few days on a few, you know a week or two

777
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,640
to iron it out perfectly, which is why there's so many glitches and stuff, but

778
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,440
That's the the idea is just to make it real get people hype was there and then you know, yeah all that was there

779
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,200
was there something in there that like

780
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
You didn't have to add

781
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,320
But you were like I want to add this and like it ended up being like

782
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,840
Oh, but that was like way more trouble than it was worth like I spent like we spent like a month adding this stupid thing and like well

783
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,520
I think I think most things that we ended up spending a lot of time on

784
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,280
Are worth because people like them. Yeah, they're just sort of like

785
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:18,880
Maybe arguably like time investment to enjoyment gained is like skewed. I think I'm Ali Oop's phone and her camera

786
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Considering maybe not doing that, but it was funny

787
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,160
Just to be able to take a selfie even if the selfie camera is quite like you couldn't really angle it in a way

788
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,080
So you could see things. Yeah, but it was it's funny that you can do it at all. It is funny

789
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,760
It would be I mean, I mean, it's it's just yeah, it's just it's just funny and like

790
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,120
What's flight flavorful? I guess thematic character building that it's in the game. Yeah at all. Yeah

791
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,200
I think I've said this before but this was a lot of a lot of my

792
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
experience with the phantom's revenge is

793
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Being like hey, I got a little funny idea for something I can add. Haha wouldn't it? Yeah, whatever

794
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,280
Hey, I'll just do this thing and then it takes me like several weeks and I'm like

795
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,720
Regretting it and I'm like, why did I do this? Like why did I decide why did I decide to add floor reflections?

796
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,720
Why did I decide to add like, you know a dynamic blood splatter on like the walls and stuff?

797
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Yeah

798
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah, there's definitely moments where I'm like, ah, how about this and I say to Charlie

799
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,920
What would it be like a big load of hassle and terrible coding nightmares if we did this tiny little thing?

800
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
And he goes, yeah, ah

801
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,360
Yes, it would and I'm like, okay, we don't need to do it and we'll we'll not do it you

802
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,560
You poached you poached Charlie from me give I

803
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:53,620
Did yeah, you gave you gave me told him you wanted you gave me Charlie and then you took him back for me

804
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,720
How could you Indian give her how could you poach? How could you poach your own brother?

805
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,800
Well, yeah, I'm taking it been taken. Oh my god. It was oh my god

806
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
I

807
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Remember I remember that

808
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,240
Charlie cuz he was like, you know, he made a runaway from snakes

809
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Yeah, and he was like working on little projects here and there and I was like, okay Tom

810
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,720
Does game development work?

811
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,760
Maybe you should talk to Tom and like do things and that never really happened because Tom wants to be in control of his thing

812
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,880
And they didn't really talk so it's like yeah, whatever. Yeah, but Ben you were talking about making a game

813
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,080
Hey Charlie go talk to Ben about this thing. Yeah, you know, you know, it's thing

814
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,560
Yeah, and then apparently you didn't get back to him. So it's just like I don't know what to do

815
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,360
Yeah, I was a bit anything else happening. Yeah, I was a bit of a dick

816
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,960
I didn't get back to him for a while because I think I've said this before I

817
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,200
Sort of told him what this is when I had not even really started working on the game

818
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,040
But I was like, I think I think this was this was when I was working on the s revert animation

819
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,380
I was like, but I know I'm gonna make the game and I was talking to

820
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,480
Charlie and I was I told him like what the game was

821
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,520
Kind of gonna be I kind of said like here's my idea for it

822
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,640
It was pretty rough at the time and he he was like hey, I prototyped this thing like what do you think and it was

823
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,120
Not it was not

824
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,720
Exactly what I had envisioned it was something a little different. It wasn't because it wasn't like a straight-up ghosted him after that

825
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,680
I

826
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,920
Did eventually get back to him. It was it was I didn't I didn't know what to say because it was like

827
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,720
This is this is good and all but it's not what I was

828
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,280
picturing and like

829
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
What do I do I?

830
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,000
Should I just say like no or should I just be like hey change it or should I and I think I

831
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,360
Just wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I think eventually I decided like I kind of I kind of just want to make it myself

832
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I thought I was fucking do it myself

833
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,560
Then so yeah, I hope yeah, I hope I hope I guess it all worked out

834
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,320
Yeah, yeah, I mean it's really just a thing of

835
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Communication it's harder to communicate through discord messages and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah

836
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,880
It's for me to just go up and talk to him like when we're developing the game

837
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,880
We're in the same room. He's coding things and I'm like either drawing or like fucking around thinking

838
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,120
Yes, and then we like have discussions about how do you think this should work? I'm like, okay, let's think um

839
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,920
conveyance

840
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,560
in an in an alternate in an alternate universe where I had been like I

841
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,080
Had jumped on it and I had been like, okay, Charlie. No, no, you got to rework this here

842
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,400
You got to make you got to make it like this. You got to you got to do like this

843
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
You got to add this you got to add that I

844
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Yeah, I imagine the process of like

845
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,880
get him him

846
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,440
Making changes to the prototype sending them back to me me be I'm like, okay change this this this and that and then like

847
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,000
Sending it back waiting for him to do that getting it back. I imagine that would have been

848
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
painstaking

849
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,520
So a little bit. Yeah, maybe it's probably fine

850
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
I

851
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,920
Must it is must be nice to have a to have a code guy though must be nice to have a brother

852
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Must be yeah

853
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,080
Yeah, must be nice. Oh well

854
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,480
He doesn't know that feeling at all, right Ben

855
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Not it not anymore

856
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,720
Although I mean, I don't regret I don't regret learning I don't regret learning GML I

857
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,000
Feel like I learned I feel like I learned a lot of code

858
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,880
Working on it. Yeah, but I can keep using in the future. I don't need a code guy. I'll never need a code guy again

859
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,080
Coding is easy. Yeah, coding is easy by the way

860
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,440
It's literally it's literally just looking up how to just you literally just Google

861
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,200
How do I do this and there's someone wrote it's like you type this and you go okay?

862
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Yeah, I think I've seen a car kind of you just Google how to fix a car and then they should just tell you right there

863
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,480
I mean unironically unironically

864
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
Coding is like fixing a car only

865
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,200
Nothing happens if you fuck it up and you can just keep trying until it works. So yeah, basically the easiest thing

866
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:25,000
Okay, that's I'll learn to code right now, but for me. Yeah coding. Yeah, coding is like it's interesting

867
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,720
but it's like

868
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,480
The the skill floor like you need to like get a ladder to get to that floor

869
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Before you're like actually able to

870
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:41,720
creatively solve problems with like idea like knowledge of like, okay, this kind of code would work

871
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:49,040
If this and that so I'll just make a thing and then I'll experiment like it would take a long time for me to get to the

872
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
experimental phase of being a programmer

873
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,400
Which is the fun part and copy pasting stuff only works if someone else has done it

874
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,920
And if you're trying to make something specific, it's sometimes not

875
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,920
Easy to find that you know at least not a good teacher, you know, I'm thinking about it

876
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,240
And I'm realizing that I am a genius because again yet again

877
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm coming to I'm how many how many times must I have the same revelation over and over again of what a genius I am

878
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,520
How many different fields? How many different mountains must I conquer before I'm finally finished already?

879
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:34,840
The the it was just like in in vapors. I had never made a comic and I was like, well, I guess I guess I'll just do it

880
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,840
I guess I'll just start working on it and I'll figure it out as I went along and that was and then I did and

881
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,520
Then same with phantom's revenge coding. I'm just like, well, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna start making it like I don't know

882
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,820
What I'm doing, but I fuck it. I'll just figure it out and I did

883
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:55,200
And yeah, and and I just just keep chiseled just keep hammering away at it until it's how you want it

884
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,600
And in the process you discover how to do those things and then you're like well

885
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:07,000
It is definitely possible or it would have been definitely possible for me to make pump canali myself by myself

886
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,280
All right, probably it just would have taken like four years instead of right like nine months, right?

887
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,160
Yeah, four to five to six years. It would take a long time

888
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,920
I guess Charlie has been learning to code for a long time or are you pretty long time?

889
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,640
He went to uni for three years for it and also he's just been like extra curricular like coding all the time

890
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:34,840
He loves I don't think he loves coding, but he loves making games and being interested in like trying to find out how to do things

891
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:41,920
Yeah, yeah once a coding university and you went to PCP University and finally a brought both talents together

892
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,160
To fuse and make this ultimate product for the masses

893
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Yes

894
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,320
PCP is is only game. It's only game game people now damn

895
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,640
It's can't watch it no more. I can't relate. Yeah, can't can relate no more

896
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,240
tech bro

897
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,680
Once you become a game developer all of your comics. Yeah, yeah

898
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,800
Yeah, they're swept away in the tide. It's the source for us lost. Where is she she's gone?

899
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah, true. It's it's just like it's just like toy store, you know everyone nobody wants to play with cowboy toys anymore

900
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,480
Everyone want now everyone wants space toys as soon as Sputnik went up, you know everything changed

901
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:35,520
Is it's kind of like when I switched over from short films to comics my short film side doesn't exist anymore?

902
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
They just they just

903
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
They just melt it away

904
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,320
Yeah, you like dismantle them and use the skill points to put into new. Oh, I actually

905
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,160
I actually am currently doing that exact same thing you just described right now

906
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,120
They melt it away like something melting away

907
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,680
No, I mean they melt it away like something

908
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,480
I won't specify in the scene that I'm drawing in in slime and punishment right now because it would be a spoiler for the end

909
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,880
For the end my god

910
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,400
Does phantom horn get melted into a skeleton of horn like if you lose the game?

911
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,800
That definitely phantom horn shoot like buckets of cum and it looks like it's like it's like melting in their hand

912
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
That happens

913
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,320
I'm not gonna answer any I can't answer that

914
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,520
Cuz it's true. I can't answer that specific question

915
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,240
Yeah, you can't you can't give any direction on that question cuz if you if you had asked anything else

916
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,740
I could tell you no, but unfortunately

917
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,520
I can't answer that specific query either positively or not actually um

918
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,120
It's like the idea that you do the whole phantoms revenge like slime and punishment comic and right at the end

919
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,240
It becomes extremely explicit 18 plus poor and that's how villain versus gonna end and then

920
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,360
And that's the reward for getting to the end

921
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,280
There's instead of like it's like instead of like a confirm

922
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,600
Are you over the age of 18 before you see it instead?

923
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:07,120
I have you beat a video game cuz I'm like only a heart only a hardcore gamer could see this pornography

924
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,800
That'll show there they're mature, you know ages just a number right ages just a number and you just gotta you gotta prove

925
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:23,120
It's your epic gaming skill is more important than like what's on your driver's license if you want to read my porn or be my girlfriend

926
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,280
I didn't I shouldn't say that on a podcast. It's really about that'll be quoted

927
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,800
It's really about mental maturity

928
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,360
People think I'm serious, you know in and gaming and gaming skill is

929
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,760
The best indicator science has yet found it's better than IQ

930
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,240
It's you have to be quite mature. I have no video game

931
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,360
Especially one that's like a have to be spin off of a spin off of a based on

932
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,520
Another bullshit that Benzane is doing

933
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,440
That's right. That's right. Um, yes

934
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,600
Wait, that's the big difference in the games is that mine has this market appeal because it's just two characters

935
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:08,280
Yeah, man, that's the formula, you know, there's um, there's punk and Ali and there's bongo and Luna. That's that's the two

936
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,280
It's always the two

937
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,240
Phantom always to handsome and horn Phantom and Phantom and who?

938
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,320
Phantom and who? There's no one there. Yeah, Phantom's got a sidekick. Phantom's got his little his little pet

939
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
He can he's got he's also got platinum

940
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,600
You know his trusty sidekick platinum the sword who he can marry now in the game if you so choose

941
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Can you kiss the sword and cut your lip you can kiss the sword it doesn't cut your lip though because phantom's very he's pretty good

942
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,040
He knows how to handle knows how to think he's an experience. He's an experienced love knows how to use his tongue

943
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:50,520
Right, you know, so if you know the amateur tongue kisser, of course, you'll cut your your lip

944
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,920
But unlike phantom horn lots of experience

945
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,640
I mean, I mean if you're if you're cutting your lip when you kiss your sword, you know

946
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,160
You're your gaming skill level is not high enough for you to be getting married in my sort of mental disorder

947
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,900
If you cut your lip while kissing a sword really that's my opinion. It's my take of the day

948
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,860
And you it shouldn't be happening if you're a gamer. True. Let's just let's just let's just put it that way

949
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,380
Shit, I feel I was gonna was I gonna mention? Oh, oh, I do have one

950
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,780
Yeah, I had one thing to mention. It's not exactly relevant

951
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:30,940
Should I should I say it? Well, if it's I'm just gonna know you go first

952
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660
the the pumpkin early thing

953
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,760
to wrap up

954
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Play that game

955
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,200
In terms of in terms of like what's gonna happen in the future

956
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,040
Yeah, we're gonna be working on it

957
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:51,840
I think in March and just just working just like doing some things maybe have a little hot fix patch for some of the

958
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,680
The more obvious and easy to fix problems, right?

959
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:02,520
Not gonna be an overhaul or anything, but we may once my Lord of Ghost Kickstarter is all squared away and done

960
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,640
We may be doing a Kickstarter to raise funds for paying for the making of the whole thing

961
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:16,480
Yeah, I was wondering about so stay tuned for for potential that I'm not entirely sure how long it's gonna take and stuff

962
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,280
We'll have to like figure out costs and and things

963
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,400
Yeah, but that's the general idea because it seems like that it seems like lots of people want that

964
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,880
It's the sort of normal thing that an indie game studio could do. Yeah, and I think it would work pretty well

965
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:38,340
Really release a demo and then kickstart development on the full game. Yeah makes it makes sense to me

966
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Do you I?

967
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,040
guess do you

968
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Have anything you are

969
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,600
You're like we're for sure gonna add this that you want to mention

970
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,120
And well for sure

971
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,320
Uh

972
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,040
There's there's dialogue things

973
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,240
That we couldn't get done for the demo

974
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:10,780
Obviously, there's gonna be NPCs and and things there's lots of different zones wait wait

975
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:19,280
Yes, I had a complaint there was at least one time when a signs dialogue box would not advance

976
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,080
I like mashed the F key or I like mashed the key for a while before that damn

977
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,040
Dialogue box advance. Yes, the dialogue box event was a little bit weird. Yeah

978
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,800
I just remembered that just nice

979
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,360
Quality of life upgrades not really upgrades, but just sort of like fixes

980
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,800
Like that. We're we're we're tallying them up. We're gonna go through the wall. Okay fix them. Okay

981
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
if anybody has like

982
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:56,360
Thoughts complaints go to the pumpkin alley itch.io community tab and leave like a a post

983
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,520
Detailing everything because when we're going to like check everything

984
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,400
It's the easiest place to go and like double-check what people thought

985
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,360
What the criticisms were?

986
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,280
So we can like look at them all at the in one place. Yeah. Yeah, so

987
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,920
Anyway, you were saying you were saying

988
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,440
You were you were enumerating things you were going to add which I'm curious about. Oh, yeah

989
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,680
So there's there's boss battles. Yeah, and lots of enemies

990
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,120
I kind of what the design philosophy for for combat is that I don't want it to be like God of War

991
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,120
It's not like a combat heavy game. Yeah, and when you do fight an enemy. I want it to be

992
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,320
More of a puzzle than just running at something and setting in the moon fire. Yeah

993
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,680
Maybe there could be some easier enemies like that, but that would feel like padding but maybe

994
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,760
But like generally they'll be like, oh this enemy has some sort of shield that you need to like

995
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,520
Knock off before you can burn them or this enemy. Yeah is made of a material that can't be burned

996
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:06,400
Unless you change something in the environment that makes them burnable, you know, that's the sort of idea for the buses and

997
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,600
And and enemies. Yeah, so that's gonna be expanded a lot that the mushroom was is pretty good

998
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,720
I think it explains that yeah, the most that is a puzzle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the mushroom is I

999
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,440
He kind of jump-scared me a little bit when he like the idea

1000
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,240
Yeah, when he first yeah when he first yells and like the music changes. I was like, oh my god. What the fuck?

1001
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Yeah, I didn't because there had not I didn't think there were any enemies in the game. So I was like

1002
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,280
Yeah, it gotcha. Yeah, it got me it got me a little bit

1003
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,200
Uh, whatever. There's there's there's a dialogue system. There's like

1004
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm not entirely sure how we're gonna do this. I had this idea

1005
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,960
Initially that like you could press a button to like chat with the other character

1006
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,400
So like you could just say something and and the dialogue that they have would be like

1007
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,800
Contextual contextual to like the the room or like the general zone that you're in

1008
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,280
And there would be like pulling from a pool of like possible chat options. Yes

1009
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,400
And if there's like a puzzle room you could press the button

1010
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,160
And punk would say what do you think and ali would say? I don't fucking know like you just have like a little

1011
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,640
Maybe it could be a helpful thing. Wait a second. I don't know how easy that would be to program though for like every room to have a little

1012
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,440
little potential dialogue, but that's uh, it's an idea

1013
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
I mean, that's not

1014
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,080
It it could be I mean, I mean

1015
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,320
Phantom's revenge has a little uh has a little you know not not to brag or anything

1016
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:44,880
But Phantom's revenge has a little contextual dialogue where in every room you can examine every enemy and you can examine the room

1017
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,720
And you can examine everything and depending on where you are you'll get a little different different dialogue boxes

1018
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,680
so there it's it's it's like um the the issue is like

1019
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,280
One if a dialogue box appears on screen, are you still able to move and will that halt the flow of platforming?

1020
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
And if it doesn't halt the flow

1021
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,800
Will it get in the way of like visually because they don't speak English they go

1022
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:19,520
They're gonna have like a animal crossing or okami or banjo banjo kazooie is the one that jumps to my hand

1023
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,960
Um, they're gonna talk like that. So it's gonna have to be in text and

1024
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I don't know how that's gonna fit with like

1025
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,000
gameplay

1026
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,280
unnecessarily

1027
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,240
um

1028
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,840
But there's definitely gonna be like dialogue scenes where like you there's like a threshold and it's a kind of a cut scene

1029
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,040
Where they talk about the story or whatever and they talk to an mpc or something like that

1030
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,760
Does ali talk in bell jpe?

1031
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,960
Um in bell jpe there there's like a few moments where they speak but like there's no like quotes

1032
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,400
Yeah in in the text the text underneath each image is like the narrator saying what's happening

1033
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,960
Um, or like if you are a punk you do this and you do that and you say to ali that's fucking sick

1034
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,160
um

1035
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,760
But like they don't have like speech bubbles and there's no like quotes at the bottom to to to be able to tell

1036
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,480
But there is at least one place. I remember where like

1037
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,320
um

1038
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,920
ali and pump have

1039
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,320
Reunited after run away from snakes the game and panel

1040
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,400
And they're saying something about stuff and ali has her phone back

1041
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Excellent, so they speak do I gotta me spare gotta play run away from snakes before I get into this

1042
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,680
Yeah, yeah, you have to play run away from snakes or the game won't make any sense

1043
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,360
You got you got to read bell jpe and play the the run away from snakes panel

1044
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,760
Which is a video game panel that is a is a panel of the comic and also a video game

1045
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,680
It's an endless runner. It's fun. It's hard, but it's it's it's a lord

1046
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,480
There was is there still a leaderboard for that?

1047
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,280
I think that broke. Um

1048
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,400
That part of the thing was so confusing and terrible idea

1049
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,040
um

1050
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,440
When it broke, we were like, no, we'll leave it. No, you know, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah

1051
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,280
I mean, it was fun. It was fun to fuck around with while it was while it was uh happening though

1052
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
Yeah

1053
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,200
Oh, I had um

1054
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Yeah, the thing I was gonna say was I had a

1055
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,440
I had a

1056
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,520
An idea for the the eventual

1057
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,600
Book form for slime and punishment, which by the way

1058
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,600
I guess I'll be curious to know when you wanted when you're gonna do

1059
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,840
Uh, a kickstarter for that because I am I'm gonna kickstart the book

1060
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,040
And I don't want to run our kick starters at the same time. So, um, yeah, sure. I mean, um

1061
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,000
It will depend

1062
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,880
On first I think march is gonna be my love ghosts kickstarter

1063
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Backer reward like finally finish all of that stuff send them off

1064
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,200
And then it'll be either during march or in april

1065
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,120
Figuring out the kickstarter and then maybe launching it sometime in april. I guess

1066
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:24,400
Yeah, but I don't know yet. It'll maybe it'll depend on how long it takes for me to do all the the lord of ghosts stuff

1067
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,680
Yeah, well, I mean I want to hmm. I mean, I guess I'd see no reason

1068
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,800
I guess I'm gonna try and run the

1069
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,720
Slime and punishment kickstarter as soon as I I can

1070
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,960
So maybe I mean I might kind of like finish the comic and then basically immediately try to

1071
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,200
You know figure out how I'm gonna print it and yeah, and it'll it'll just depend on how long it takes me to settle on like

1072
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,360
Okay, this is the final design of the book. These are the printers. I'm going with

1073
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,360
Okay

1074
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Yeah, so that's that's what uh

1075
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
That's what that depends on

1076
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,680
but anyway

1077
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,640
I I had thought right I had envisioned

1078
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
Slime and punishment as being like

1079
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,800
The problem sleuth books. I haven't read the homestuck books

1080
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,640
So I don't know if they're the same but the problem sleuth books generally have four panels on a page and then at the bottom

1081
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,480
um

1082
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,400
Andrew hussey has a running commentary where every page he has little uh

1083
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,800
Little notes about the panels and I was gonna do that

1084
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,040
but I think

1085
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,760
A lot of panels like a lot of pages I could but I don't know if I have something to say on every page

1086
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,160
So I think it actually might be better and maybe also funnier

1087
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,200
I think the way I might actually end up doing it

1088
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,680
Is to have like an index section at the end with footnotes

1089
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,760
Like infinite jest, you know infinite jest has like the whole book is full of like little

1090
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,800
Asterisks that lead to the back and there's a whole like there's like

1091
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,680
Several chapters worth of like

1092
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,400
Notes and indexes and like little side stories that relate to uh, whatever

1093
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:09,760
So I think I'm gonna have an index section where I will have little asterisks that will direct you to a part where I

1094
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,840
explain like

1095
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
This is this is why I

1096
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,840
This was the context that made me add this to the story or oh, yeah the the the the player

1097
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,000
Avatars that are depicted on these pages are are these people

1098
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,080
Or does the homesick books do that? I thought they did do that, right?

1099
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,360
That they would have the little commentary. I don't know it

1100
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,240
They do they do I have some of them word. They have a little they have a little index

1101
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,880
They have an index section not an index. No, they have the the comments right on the page, right?

1102
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,720
Right on the page at the bottom. Yeah, I just I just explained that my original idea was going to be that

1103
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,040
But I think I want to have it in a I want to have

1104
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,480
I want to have foot I want to have foot footnotes in their own section like annotated almost, right?

1105
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,480
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, because it definitely needs it. It definitely needs that for certain things

1106
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,200
that might be a little confusing or

1107
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,680
something like

1108
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,960
in the

1109
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,280
In the index section is probably where I would put

1110
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,400
For instance, there are some panels that there are some pages of it that are me

1111
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,000
Recreating or like pseudo recreating

1112
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,720
Drawings that chris chan did and I would probably like have a little

1113
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,040
asterisk that would direct you to a page in the index where I'd be like

1114
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,520
Yeah, here are the original images that these

1115
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,440
Panels were were based on a referencing or something like that

1116
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,320
Because I couldn't I couldn't fit that in a I couldn't fit that in us in a foot. You should um

1117
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,200
You should do it that every time you mentioned chris chan

1118
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:47,280
You write another like little mention right next to chris chan's name saying yeah, yeah, I know I know they're in jail

1119
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,360
Yeah, I know about the several things he did and

1120
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,080
But I've got every time in a book in a book in a book. I leave a little footnote

1121
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:59,120
That's like, yeah, please don't comment telling me uh about the chris chan being in jail. I I know

1122
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,280
Please and then at the end of the book. I should put please like comment and subscribe

1123
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,800
Uh, ring the bell. Yeah, and then you should um, yeah, you should just yeah

1124
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,200
You should drop off the book at a random bookstore and then people be like what the fuck is this what the

1125
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,120
What the niche hell shit bullshit internet bullshit is this?

1126
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,920
That's the brand I

1127
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,800
Yeah, I guess that is the brand. I guess that is the brand. Um, I'm just allergic to mass market appeal

1128
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
I I I would be

1129
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,080
You know what if anybody actually likes if anyone actually liked my game

1130
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,520
I would be disappointed in myself. I would hate them. I would if you like my game. Fuck you

1131
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,720
You're an idiot. I made that game specifically to attract the kind of people I hate

1132
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,360
So if you like it that means I fucking hate you

1133
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,440
I made that game specifically to be

1134
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,440
I made the game specifically to be fun on its own

1135
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,680
In a way that people that had not read the comic could enjoy anyway

1136
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,560
But in a way that is also sort of very strongly gesturing towards

1137
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,360
Hey, hey, hey, check the comic out. Hey

1138
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,160
You should read the comic if you want additional context on like what's going on in this game

1139
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,280
You don't have to read the comic, but like you should you should read you should read the comic though

1140
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Please, please read the comic

1141
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,320
Please please read the comic

1142
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:31,120
And please watch this this this t-bat plays. Let's play. It's very important to understand. No, that's not things

1143
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Are gonna make sense even

1144
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,920
Even I even I would not

1145
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,920
Even I would not expect someone to watch t-bap in order to understand the the context there

1146
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
All you need to know is that he is a

1147
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,040
he is a

1148
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,040
All you need to know is that he is a

1149
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
mlp youtube reviewer

1150
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,720
Cartoon

1151
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,800
Cartoon avatar in the side of the in the side of the video avatar, that's all you need to know

1152
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,640
And you don't you don't actually have to go and like experience it just really it's self-evident everything

1153
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,480
I mean

1154
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,000
I mean

1155
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,560
You can just see it. You can just see it in his face

1156
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,640
It's like

1157
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,160
He's got that youtuber in the corner of face. He does right? That's me in the corner

1158
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:27,520
That's my mlp sonar ranting about episodes of my little pony. I

1159
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,480
I I'm drawing his

1160
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,040
Losing my subscribers

1161
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,360
I'm drawing his fight basically his final scene

1162
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:45,360
Right now and it's it's making me uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable to draw, but I have to do it. I think

1163
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,160
I don't know. I think I talked about this before. I don't know how people will react. First of all

1164
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:56,160
I don't know if anyone cares. I don't know if anyone reads the comic a few like I know I know that a handful of people do

1165
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,240
I don't know if the catch-up

1166
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,280
Uh, yeah, I am at least I mean I

1167
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,600
So after you drop off after you drop the little animation for what I

1168
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,200
I thought at the time was the finale. I was like, oh, well no more

1169
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,120
Simon punishment. I guess and I like oh wait still going on, huh?

1170
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
I called it the finale

1171
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,400
Even though I sort of knew at the time that I knew I was going to make the game even then so I don't know why I

1172
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:27,840
Yeah, I and then I thought oh the game must be like the extended and I might be the finale part too, but not really

1173
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,840
It's interesting

1174
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:35,600
No, no the game was the game was always going to be the true ending. Um, but uh

1175
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,760
I'm drawing

1176
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,760
The finale I'm drawing the final scene

1177
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,040
And it's very uncomfortable and if anyone cares. I wonder I wonder if they'll

1178
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
I'm I think on another episode

1179
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:55,040
I said like it might feel very different to a reader than it feels to me a reader might just read something

1180
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,920
And just be like oh lol that happened

1181
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,800
um, and me I might like feel it differently and I might be like

1182
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,440
I don't know. I think it might be different and to me. I'm drawing it and I feel

1183
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,040
Discomfort I feel disquieted I feel

1184
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,560
I don't I would you I would you being like really

1185
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:22,480
I would even I would even say I would I would even say horrified. I would say I would say silence you feel the platform

1186
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,360
You feel like like the libs have come after you they've taken everything away from you

1187
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,880
Well, what well what I'm getting at is it's an uncomfortable scene and I wonder if people will dislike it and be like

1188
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,720
I don't like the ending because it's uncomfortable

1189
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,520
Or I wonder if

1190
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,880
Nobody will

1191
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,760
Mind I don't know because if someone complained about it

1192
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,720
If someone was like wow that ending was was like why did you do why did it end that way?

1193
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,360
I would understand why they felt that way and I wouldn't disagree with them

1194
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,920
I I would merely tell them

1195
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,840
That it's what my heart. I followed my heart. My heart told me to do it

1196
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,240
The muse the music it was literally it literally was not my choice

1197
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,320
The muses spoke through me and they told me to do that and I and I just had to do it

1198
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,400
And it and that's and that's not even an exact. That's not even exaggeration

1199
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,880
I'm sort of thinking like is it like a gory like he gets

1200
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,960
He's slowly like close up of him falling into a wood chipper and you see in all the glory detail

1201
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,520
I'm not going to say what it better not be

1202
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,400
No, I can I can neither confirm nor deny that specific

1203
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,320
That's specific thing that one there's gonna be some fourth wall

1204
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,120
Breaking bullshit where it cuts to Ben St. Drawing the comic and he's like I think I'll just stop or some

1205
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,680
deep

1206
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,400
That's that would be very uncomfortable. It's a

1207
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,720
It's a it's a Stephen King

1208
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:57,200
Dark tower the ending just loops back to the beginning

1209
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,960
Infinite I don't want to read this comic again

1210
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,920
Yeah, well you have to you just have to keep reading it. You just have to keep reading and reading and replaying and replaying it

1211
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,680
That's how bonga luna

1212
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:14,960
That's how bonga luna was supposed to end. It was supposed to just restart back to the beginning loop forever

1213
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,680
Is that true? Is it is that no, that's not true. I mean that up. Oh, okay

1214
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,840
well

1215
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,000
So I guess that's all just to say that I'm curious what people will

1216
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,720
Feel about the ending and I guess

1217
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,320
For the month I kind of just hope I hope I hope people feel anything at all about it. Even if they're mad

1218
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,040
disgusted

1219
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,200
Infuriated disappointed

1220
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920
That's all that's all good

1221
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,520
That's that's all a net positive if everyone's just like

1222
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,560
Oh, whatever. I kind of just didn't even notice. Oh, I didn't even read it

1223
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,240
Yeah, that would be that's that's that's the worst-case scenario

1224
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,720
Uh me going around being like, hey, hey guys, you read the end of the slime and punishment. What are you? Who?

1225
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,560
Slime and what?

1226
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,560
Who are you? Why are you talking to me?

1227
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,080
This is a this is a school. This is a school zone. You're not allowed within 500 feet. Oh my god. I have this uh

1228
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Oh my god. Oh, okay

1229
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,120
Is the ending that dark that you're not allowed out of school zone after it's happened?

1230
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,600
Yeah, we read the end of slime and punishment and we've decided you're no longer allowed you're no longer allowed within 500 feet of a school

1231
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,520
Yeah, and um

1232
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,840
Slime and punishment cuts to phantom horn in bed and he's all like and that's my story and it and it's like another pony

1233
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,920
It's like one of the one of the toddler ponies is like wow, that's crazy

1234
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,680
The end of slime and punishment is a is just phantom horn turning to the camera and and

1235
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:50,000
As speaking as me he delivers a direct apology and a list of people that he that he is that the author has groomed

1236
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,520
And he's sorry and he's really sorry though. Give him another chance

1237
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,400
Yeah, that's how that's how villain versions two

1238
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,120
Oh, we all got to do it. Yeah, we all gotta do it now. You have to do it too. Give that's how punk and aliens

1239
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:12,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give you gotta do it. Yeah punk turns to the camera just list off all the people

1240
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,960
Sorry, I groomed

1241
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,720
Uh, this dog I groomed the rex. I groomed alex. I groomed chachi. I groomed

1242
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,120
Um tico all all poodles that live in my neighborhood

1243
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:34,320
So, uh, anyway, uh, that's I guess that's I guess that's all I guess that's all that's that's pretty epic

1244
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,400
I think so what I I want to I want to talk to you

1247
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,000
Cheesy you're just here for diversity hiring really

Back with a new bottle of sparkling water. Okay, go. Um, how come you didn't have a black guest on for black history month, huh?

1252
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,480

1253
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,480
Wait, do you guys wait? Do you guys know black people?

1254
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,920
Uh, no, I know zen huckstable

I guess kind of who where is he? I kind of disappeared a little

1256
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,080
I saw him

1257
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,360
not

1258
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,200
Maybe if you

1259
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,160
Maybe a month or two ago, uh, I think

1260
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,600
You should um, you should see him

1261
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,800
I see him every once in a while because he lives he lives sort of nearby

1262
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,200
She got him on the on the podcast and get the zen update because that guy's like a ghost now

1263
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,440
Yeah, I don't know if he would want to be on because he's he's kind of gone ghosts

1264
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,720
He's he's kind of gone in the real world. He has a band or something. He isn't he isn't a band. He isn't a band

1265
01:15:54,720 --> 01:16:00,880
It is cool. I saw them. I saw them live. Uh, they're they were great. That's epic. That's cool. Oh never mind, dude

1266
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,880
Fuck podcasting

1267
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,560
I yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's either you got in a band or you do a podcast. You kind of have both

1268
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,760
That's too much

1269
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
But I want to I chose wrong

1270
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Ben on the wrong horse like you always do Ben

1271
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,680
um, but

1272
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,680
Yeah, phantom horn. Yeah, exactly

1273
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,600
I want the the inferior the inferior brother the dandy de Vito to keg standards. Arnold Schwarzenegger

1274
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:33,120
Where the fuck is keg standard? Where's keg standard? That's what I kept saying every time reading slamming punishment

1275
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,520
Like when is keg standard gonna pop in and save the day?

1276
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,960
Uh keg standard is in slamming punishment keg standard does in fact make a cameo

1277
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,800
I drew that uh, actually, I'll be I'll probably be posting that

1278
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,440
in a few days

1279
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,280
Yeah

1280
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,480
I asked

1281
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,320
I asked I thought I thought keg should make a cameo at least once

1282
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,760
And so I asked this was this was like this was like a year ago

1283
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,720
Which is how fucked up time is

1284
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,800
like a year ago

1285
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,400
I asked nate

1286
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,920
Hey, what would you like?

1287
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,400
Do you have any input on like what keg's cameo should be and he did?

1288
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,480
and

1289
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,120
This is actually pretty funny. He did he was like, hey, what if keg did this and I was like, okay cool

1290
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,200
And I didn't I didn't depict it exactly the way he described

1291
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,600
but I incorporated the joke that he that he suggested and

1292
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:33,440
I and I posted those pages in my my patron discord channel and

1293
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
A bunch of people were like

1294
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,880
Is this like a like I don't get it like is this a reference to something like what like what it why does he

1295
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,720
What is this and I was just like lol nah

1296
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,600
Nate just said keg should say that

1297
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,360
Because it's funny and everyone was like why is he's saying

1298
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,200
It may it was funnier in my opinion. I was like good

1299
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,160
uh, there's there's it's

1300
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,160
It's good. I think it was I think I think it may at least to me it made it funnier

1301
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,440
also keg kegs the kegs the pony

1302
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,760
That um that says all the people he groomed right that is that the funny thing Nate wanted you to put

1303
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
it

1304
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,320
I'm not gonna say it's just a little it's just a little weird keg moment

1305
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,440
keg moment

1306
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,840
Yeah, it's just just it's just a little weird quirky keg moment. That's just a little bit like, huh?

1307
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,240
What?

1308
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,360
Oh, no, I think I think it was I think it was crack said

1309
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:40,400
Like cracks said someone asked like why is why is keg saying this and I was like, I don't know lol

1310
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:46,400
And Nate Nate said to and and crack was like, oh, I thought you were making fun of him

1311
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,480
You're telling me Nate told you to to have this like oh, okay

1312
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,560
Uh, I was like, yes base phantom horn beats beats keg to death

1313
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,000
And the the whales whales and pain from all the fucking kicks that he's getting

1314
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,160
Yeah, he's like, hey, what if keg? Hey, what if can't just beat the shit out of phantom?

1315
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,480
Well, yeah, that would be yeah, that would be pretty funny. Okay, bro

1316
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,160
Yeah, he has it coming. He's been on his high horse for too long

1317
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,960
He is on his high. He's on he's on virginia

1318
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,760
Hey, he's a little high slime wood

1319
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,600
Hey, oh

1320
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,120
got him

1321
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:30,480
But um, I wanted to talk to you uh bent about because I I I finally I I did my first convention this uh past weekend

1322
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,160
Yeah, I saw that's why you couldn't be on last week, right?

1323
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:40,080
Because you were doing that uh that con I saw you tweet that picture of you at the con table

1324
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,640
And you look great. Thank you. Your hair looks amazing. Thank you

1325
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,480
Thank you king. Thank you. I um, yeah, it was interesting doing a con

1326
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,800
um

1327
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,560
And I I've sold I sold like half of my inventory

1328
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:03,440
When I was uh, yeah, yeah, it was like I I still have not done a full con. I've only done that that mini mice

1329
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:08,320
Like pseudo con table outdoor thing. Are you gonna just not quite the same?

1330
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,080
Are you gonna apply for the full one once the registrations are open for that or?

1331
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,440
Oh god, I didn't even think about that

1332
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,320
Yeah, I want to do it again

1333
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
It's probably too late shit

1334
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,160
Fuck

1335
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:28,000
Wait, I gotta google. It's probably it might be too late to do that. Uh uh mice uh convention

1336
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,880
Uh mice 2021

1337
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,400
No, okay, it looks like they have not scheduled one for mice for 2022

1338
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:45,200
Okay, uh, so okay, it's it's fine. No, okay. I'm not you should uh check on the website. See if like applications

1339
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,920
and just

1340
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,000
Well, I don't think so because they haven't yeah, they haven't even announced one for 2022 yet

1341
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,080
So because yeah in previous the last year

1342
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,040
I wanted to do it, but like

1343
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,400
Uh table space was booked like like immediately

1344
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,040
So I missed my opportunity

1345
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,400
so I

1346
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,920
I wouldn't have even been surprised if I had gone and like it was already too late

1347
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,920
Uh, but it's not

1348
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,040
um

1349
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,040
Okay, anyway, uh

1350
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,080
Yeah, so you tabled. What was that? What was the convention?

1351
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,680
It was called the rocket con and it was here in san diego and um

1352
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
It was um it might

1353
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,880
This probably this con was not necessarily perfect for comics because

1354
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,400
When I first stepped into it and I went into like the bigger halls where they had like the the vendors booths

1355
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,600
I realized that wait a second. This is a toy convention

1356
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Because it was just nothing but toys

1357
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,280
Like toy convention, huh? Like it was all the bigger booths were selling just walls of funko

1358
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,920
and everything else was like

1359
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:56,560
Everything else was like the older toys like retro toys or like the the newer stuff that's trying to look like retro toys

1360
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,600
Right, which isn't bad. Like no, that's like necessarily bad stuff. But like

1361
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,360
Yes, it was mostly for collectors and I should have known that this was going to be the case

1362
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,920
Because um this convention was hosted by a local comic book store called

1363
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,080
um

1364
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,000
TC rockets and actually I don't even know if I want to call them a comic book store because they

1365
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,120
They sell comics, but they're in a small like alley section of their of their store

1366
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,840
the rest of the store is just nothing but like toys

1367
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,320
and a section for uh tabletop games and um

1368
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,680
And that was just kind of obvious stepping in because like there was only two people there

1369
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:42,320
selling um independent comics. It was me and uh a guy who was like two booths next to me

1370
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:49,280
Right and it seemed like people were spending people were way more interested in like just getting toys there than um

1371
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
Getting comics, which makes sense

1372
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,040
Right. Yeah, also. Yeah fair enough. Yeah, also

1373
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:59,600
But what was kind of annoying was that the I was in the artist alley with my partner and um

1374
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,080
it was

1375
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,160
The room for the artist alley was kind of like

1376
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
It felt almost like conjoined

1377
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,560
The the convention didn't really do a good job of like making like

1378
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,240
Making the way people walk into the convention seemed natural

1379
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:21,680
because um the entrance of the convention was actually like the exit even though it was like at the front of the of the like

1380
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,720
Like um event center and they had to make people like walk around

1381
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:33,520
Right and then our art section of the artist alley was kind of like it was right next to the hall, but you had to like

1382
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,880
I don't know like it it doesn't

1383
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,600
incentivize you to like walk into the artist alley

1384
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,000
You kind of have to go out of your way to get to the artist alley

1385
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:46,960
Right and there was only like a handful. Yeah, there was only a handful of us there

1386
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,520
and it was um

1387
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,480
I mean, we probably could have sold more if if this convention was more focused on comics

1388
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,800
and um, but

1389
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
I mean that them's them's the beans

1390
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,480
But um a couple as they say them's the beans, but um, I I

1391
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,120
Fuck I didn't even break even

1392
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,680
I sold half of my input. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What do you mean you didn't break even? Okay

1393
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,120
So, what was your did it cost money to table? Oh, yeah, I did it cost money. It was like um

1394
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,480
Oh, you didn't you didn't you didn't uh, you didn't cover the cost of tabling that sucks. Well

1395
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:29,040
It technically everything I sold was more than like like I did like break even

1396
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:33,440
But then when I started adding the numbers how much money I spent on like merchandise

1397
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,840
And um, it it it all kind of just tallyed together and I realized wait, I didn't break even

1398
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,760
You know, so it wasn't like it wasn't like I didn't cover table cost

1399
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
It's just I didn't cover like my merch costs like I didn't sell it

1400
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,840
Enough. What do you mean?

1401
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:54,320
What do you mean you didn't okay, but you still got the merch left over. Yeah, I still got merch left over

1402
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,200
Okay, so

1403
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:03,600
Yeah, I mean, I guess if the goal if the goal in my head was um, I guess the goal in my head was kind of like to sell everything

1404
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:11,040
Um, I didn't reach get it out there at least that goal. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I sure I printed a bunch of uh

1405
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,800
I printed like 60 like villain versus chick tracks

1406
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:22,000
Which cost me like yeah, I have one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna send you more but um, I ran I ran out at the convention

1407
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,480
Send me more. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah. Did you just give those out for free? Yes, and it cost me like

1408
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,840
Hmm

1409
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:35,440
It cost me like now that I know the thing about it cost me like 45 bucks to print all those out and it was like 60 of them

1410
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,120
Because uh, yeah, yeah, because to print out like 20

1411
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,760
Was like 15 bucks

1412
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:47,520
Which doesn't seem too bad, but like when you print out more and more it just it's kind of annoying and originally I

1413
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,520
Printed out like half of them through my home printer

1414
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,400
but um

1415
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,800
But like ink cartridges like cost fucking too much

1416
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,280
So I invested in those um, those little like inks ink syringes that you like

1417
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Just refill the ink

1418
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,640
And it worked. Uh, yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, so those work pretty well

1419
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:13,920
Until like I over like I think I reached the limit of how many times I could inject my like ink into my ink cartridge because it's like

1420
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,440
It's like so I've never used those

1421
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,120
Yeah, they're they're pretty they're pretty cool. Like, um, they do work

1422
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:26,800
But there's like a limit to how many times you could inject your little cartridge with ink. I heard it's like around like

1423
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,360
30 times you could do it

1424
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,360
but um

1425
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,080
Is that cheaper than buying new cartridges it is cheaper

1426
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:40,560
But like if you don't do it right you could like just fuck up the cartridge and then you have to kind of bite the bullet and buy like

1427
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,560
Just just an actual cartridge store. It's so annoying

1428
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,800
Um, I wish they brought back those like ink subscriptions that used to have

1429
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,080
Well, I think that's and you know what I think there is ink subscriptions, but my printer is like so old they don't do it for

1430
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
For that like printer anymore

1431
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,440
And that's got you. Yep. That's frustrating

1432
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,440
But yeah, if you if you tell me the cost of how much it's spent on the merch

1433
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,960
Um, the little chick tracks my stickers. I did not

1434
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,480
Break even and that was kind of very frustrating

1435
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,840
after after the convention because like it felt like

1436
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:21,120
Um, I also did like little like um ink commissions like I would draw like just someone's character in my sketchbook for like

1437
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:28,480
25 bucks and that did pretty well. I got like three of them. There was actually yeah, there was actually this older gentleman who um

1438
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,400
Who was going around to every booth that did uh commissions that he would pay for a commission

1439
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:41,040
And um what he specifically wanted he wanted mermaids. He wanted everyone to like draw him a mermaid

1440
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,080
Right, but yeah, but the thing is that what he did was that he came up to my booth

1441
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:51,120
And he gave me like a printed picture of a of a like a model in a japanese school

1442
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,920
Like a japanese girl school uniform

1443
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,480
And she was like tied up like she had um

1444
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,800
That those type of like bondage those like rope bondages. You know what i'm talking about

1445
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,200
Yeah, you mean like yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, like the the medium

1446
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,680
Like the japanese kind of beat us and like rope played thing they do

1447
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,080
Um, so we showed you a japanese school girl in rope bondage

1448
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,240
It and said draw this as a mermaid. Yes. Yes, exactly

1449
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:25,600
And and it wasn't it wasn't hard because like the way the picture was like her like pose was like, okay

1450
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,960
It looks like she's being strung up like on a fish net almost, right?

1451
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,880
So all I had to do was just like not draw her legs and just put a mermaid tail under her skirt, right?

1452
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,640
And um, yeah

1453
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,800
Yeah, and the and the guy like I told him like, okay

1454
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,480
I'll have it done in under two hours and he just waited for a while and they told me like, you know what?

1455
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,440
I'm gonna be here the next day for the convention. Just give me a then and I'm like, all right

1456
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,960
So I finished it. Yeah, he came by the next day

1457
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,080
And I showed him the picture like here you go and he's like, okay good

1458
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:56,400
And then he like walked away after he got his picture like he already paid me the day before and everything

1459
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,480
And then I see him go to the other booths to get like their commissions

1460
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,400
but like

1461
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,280
But like I I see that after they he gets his art. He's like still talking to them

1462
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,360
Right and I'm like, what is he? What is he telling them?

1463
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,600
And then I kind of like eavesdropped a little on like my next door, uh, my neighboring booth

1464
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,320
And it sounded like he was giving them like criticism almost

1465
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:28,240
Right. Like like did they not draw the mermaid, right? Did they nice?

1466
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:34,560
Nice alpha alpha move alpha alpha move establish establish expertise

1467
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:41,280
Right because like he just like oh draw this girl as a mermaid. Okay, so I literally just drew the girl as a mermaid

1468
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,040
I don't know what these people did

1469
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,240
Or or maybe he was really complimented them. Maybe I wasn't hearing correctly. Maybe I did a garbage job

1470
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,080
And he didn't want to say anything

1471
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,520
You know

1472
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,360
Yeah, who knows? Yeah, who knows? Yeah, who knows? I mean I could DM those

1473
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:00,000
neighboring booth people because I do have like their contacts now, but

1474
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,360
Yeah, who wants to do all that? Who wants to do all that homework?

1475
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,320
You know

1476
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,800
Life's too short already right and too difficult and painful life's too short to know if you did a good job

1477
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:19,040
Right, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. It's better. It's better not to know. It's better not to know

1478
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,600
He already paid me anyway. I really don't give a fuck

1479
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,240
You know how you know how many commissions I have asked that people like

1480
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,920
Look at and be like, whoa, this is great. Thanks. And I'm like, oh, you're welcome. You're welcome gamer

1481
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,840
some people

1482
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
some some people are

1483
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
it's just more

1484
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
Some people have very specific

1485
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,680
Tastes and some people are just happy to see their

1486
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:51,360
To see whatever it is. He yeah, he didn't draw their mermaid tail fishy enough. It's like this looks more like a manateed

1487
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,600
Tail

1488
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,720
Exactly

1489
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,520
Um, another funny thing is that the other

1490
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,800
So the other guy who was selling his own independent comic was like to boost down from mine

1491
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,800
And I I over here and this guy like during the whole weekend was just like

1492
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,800
Um, I I kept rehearing his elevator pitch for his comic

1493
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,600
Like over and over again because he was telling everybody and I mean I was doing that too, right with my comic

1494
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,080
When like people came by right?

1495
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,200
But um, but the first time I hear this guy's like pitch

1496
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:31,040
He was like basically like so in my story all the characters are immortal and then I'm like, oh, that sounds kind of familiar

1497
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,760
And then and then he's uh, and then he said like and there's also no heroes in my story and it's and I'm like wait a second

1498
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,920
Wait a second

1499
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:46,240
I'm thinking like is he describing villain versus these people. Is this is crook? Uh, you know crook

1500
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:53,200
Crook crook crook crook dimension crook. Uh, yeah the crook cronies the crook company

1501
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,040
Is but um

1502
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:02,240
But no, he was just describing his own because then after that he's all like also in this universe. No one like

1503
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,200
Uh regenerates back their organs if they're like, um rip the part or something

1504
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,640
And it's like, okay

1505
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,840
He's describing something completely different because that doesn't happen in my story

1506
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,840
And he he had a his comic is called like a mortal era

1507
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:23,120
And it was like about yeah, it was about like some sort of like thing happens where everyone becomes immortal

1508
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,800
But it's kind of like the immortality where so it's so it's 17

1509
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
776

1510
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,160
The best comic ever made right but this looks more like

1511
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,640
um

1512
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:40,480
It seems like this guy's goal is to kind of like get some sort of netflix deal or something because this feels like something that would

1513
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,720
Oh good. Well good luck, buddy

1514
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,920
Okay, this seems like something that would eventually become like a netflix deal or something and apparently

1515
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,600
One of his first artists he did the issue with because this guy isn't the artist

1516
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,040
He's just the writer and he he pays like several people to draw the comic

1517
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,760
and they and they have that kind of like, um

1518
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,440
I don't want to call it like the the marvel or dc house style, but like it's a very like

1519
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:11,680
Um, they they wanted to look as realistic as paul you ever like seen those comics that like wanted to look really like super realistic and it's um

1520
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,960
And it's almost like

1521
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,640
These could be like celebrities playing these characters almost, you know

1522
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,240
There's a lot of yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine

1523
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:28,480
Yeah, there's like a lot of comics in the wild that are like comics that were like intended to be pitches for shows, you know

1524
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,080
And this this kind of yeah, this kind of feels like it

1525
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,760
um

1526
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,280
Hmm the the guy seemed cool

1527
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:40,880
I was I was talking to him but um his comic wasn't something I was super interested in he didn't sound super interested in villain verse

1528
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,680
So I guess the feeling was like mutual so

1529
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,040
Yeah, that's fair. I guess

1530
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,520
um, hmm

1531
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,040
uh

1532
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
If you hmm

1533
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,880
I mean, I you know, I mean, I'm never I was thinking about this

1534
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I've I've I've never made anything with an eye to like, oh, maybe someone will adapt it. Oh, maybe someone will pick this up

1535
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,720
I've I've never even thought about it in my life

1536
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,520
uh

1537
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,800
Is that like, I don't know. I mean some some some how I I mean I I managed to

1538
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,480
I I guess I would call my comics have been

1539
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,680
profitable more or less. I mean I not like your comics are anti-netflix if you will

1540
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:32,080
Oh, I mean, I I had like uh dreams of like, oh if I make if I write down an idea for a video game then

1541
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:36,640
Then nintendo or sony I I could go to them and they would make it because like

1542
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
You know, I'm yeah, I had I had those ideas

1543
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,880
Give them a give them a shot. Yeah

1544
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,200
Give them a show just make a video game. It's a pretty good idea actually five-year-old

1545
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:53,280
Oh, me me me a me a monosan. It'll it'll cost us 900 million dollars to develop this game. Oh

1546
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:59,600
You you've forgotten the joy of childhood. Look at this. This child is innocent

1547
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,400
from the minds of babes

1548
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:07,520
A bad video game is forever a rushed video game is forever bad make it

1549
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,440
Do it it watch us on it's like that bangs gavel

1550
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:18,480
It's like that episode of uh, it's like the episode of the simpsons where like mel Gibson hires homer to write his next film

1551
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Is that a real episode? Yeah

1552
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,560
I yeah, yeah, it's mel Gibson

1553
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:30,400
I forget why because mel Gibson like is like tired of his successful like movie franchise

1554
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,080
And he's all like I can't believe he's like really does everyone like this and then he finds homers

1555
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,040
The sole person who doesn't like this franchise and he and he hires homer to like

1556
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,200
re kind of like

1557
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,480
rewrite the whole

1558
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,480
The whole kind of like a movie

1559
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:50,000
It's the one episode that ends with like the dog the dog that's looking like sideways like kind of like dog with a shift

1560
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,400
Yeah, that was shift the eyes. Yeah, you remember that wait

1561
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:59,520
That's the episode with the with the shift the eyed dog because that was homer's idea. He said like at the end of the movie

1562
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,000
I don't remember that. I remember the dog. I don't remember that episode at all

1563
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:08,720
I don't remember that plot even a little bit because they they go to hollywood. I think yeah takes place

1564
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,200
All I guess mel Gibson like hires homer

1565
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,200
They go to hollywood and homers don't want to says like and the villain at the end of the movie

1566
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,240
The real villain is going to be revealed as this dog who's going to look very shifty looking back and forth

1567
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,240
And that's how the audience is going to know they're the bad guy

1568
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,640
Uh

1569
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:30,400
And then they shoot it down, but then there's a real then at the end of the episode. Yeah, the real shifty eye dog shows up

1570
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
Yeah, I only remember that gag

1571
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,840
I remember the

1572
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,640
Gag that I liked from that. I don't know why I like it so much

1573
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,760
It's like mel Gibson comes to the simpsons house

1574
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,840
It rings the doorbell. He opens it. He says, hey, you're homer simpson

1575
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,480
I need you to come to the thing and homer says. Oh, you had me at hello

1576
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,120
And mel gibbons says I didn't say

1577
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,960
Yeah, because he didn't yeah, and I just like

1578
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,320
I don't know. Oh, yeah. Yeah, why that stuck with me. Hey, uh, that's great. That's great

1579
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,720
Oh, so anyway, good. That's a good joke

1580
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,040
Always simpsons always gets me a chuckle always gets me a laugh a gaffa out of me

1581
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,520

01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,520

Because um what I'm gonna do in my because I got two more conventions lined up because I like doing

Inventions for the these next conventions. I'm gonna make sure I break even and not like

1586
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,800

I will sell them at my booth and I'll give you a percentage

1592
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,160
Do you think that's something to be interested in?

1593
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
No

You're not gonna sell you don't think you can sell villain versus. You don't think you'll be like, yeah

1596
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,360

1602
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,480
Uh, I don't know. I'm out of I'm out of I'm out of vapor's one. I need to reprint vapor's one

1603
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,600
I have no copies of it left or have like two copies of it left

1604
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,440
um

1605
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,200
and um

1606
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,680
Yeah, I don't know. I just I think if I'm tabling

1607
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:52,880
I'm gonna sell my own stuff like I I got I got 30 seconds

1608
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,240
I got I got seconds to pitch to someone who's wandering by my table, right and they're like

1609
01:38:58,960 --> 01:38:59,920
here

1610
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,120
What what do you got and I'm gonna tell them like here's my comic

1611
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,240
I don't have time. I don't have time to be like, oh and here's this other comic by some other guy

1612
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,320
And let me tell you about that, right?

1613
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,880
I mean my thing is that if I have like a variety of comics that kind of incentivizes people to like

1614
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,080
Stay a bit longer, right? And also

1615
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,640
Like I like the idea that like, oh, there's cop. There's being there's copies of Villainverse being sold in other parts of this country

1616
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,040
Right. I do have I have a I have a friend who like lives in

1617
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:38,800
I think um in mass chusas also, um another another person who I talked about this and they said they're down

1618
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:45,200
They're gonna send me a couple copies of their they're just gonna send me like three and I'm gonna sell them three and it's like, okay, like, you know

1619
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:49,760
You don't have to like you don't have to like push this on people but it's like

1620
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,560
If people ask about it

1621
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,280
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what if uh

1622
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,560
Look, it's up to you. It's up. It's up to you. Like you don't gotta say yes

1623
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,720
Is there something I wouldn't want to worry about I wouldn't want to worry about like a percentage or anything

1624
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,520
If we just do just trade we just trade copies, right?

1625
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,160
Uh, you know, I mean

1626
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:15,280
I guess if I was gonna table like I gotta fill table space with something right

1627
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,760
Uh, yeah, you know, I mean there's um when it may you know what maybe when I reprint when I reprint vapors one

1628
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:27,440
Yeah, yeah, maybe I could maybe I could just also give you like I don't know like

1629
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:33,840
10 copies of each I guess or something and then 10 might you give me 10 might be too much

1630
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
You give me like five copies of each

1631
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,120
Okay, I mean yeah

1632
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:45,280
What what what I do what what I gonna do is just send out like issues once and then in the back

1633
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,280
It just tells you how to get an issue too

1634
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,120
because um

1635
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,280
That that's kind of something I learned from other people

1636
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,640
Like who are kind of smaller is that they don't really like

1637
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,520
Do the other issues?

1638
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,560
um

1639
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,280
Yeah, because then it's kind of harder to sell the other like if you do like a bunch of like if you

1640
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,920
If you print out like a bunch of issue too

1641
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:11,760
But like no one really has an idea of like issue one. Yeah, right? So I mean sometimes like like I

1642
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,760
I do have a bunch of spare issues to Streets and Fours and I'm thinking like

1643
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,360
For the next time I'm gonna find a better way to display all those

1644
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:26,320
So you sell issue one and then in issue issue one, there's like ordering information for the other issues right in the back

1645
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:32,560
Yeah, got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I need to make sense. I yeah, I need to update mine because it says that oh

1646
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,560
You get them off gumroad and I'm actually took them off of gumroad recently

1647
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:43,360
Uh, I think well after I after I put uh after I restock

1648
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,800
I think I'll put uh vapers one and vapers two just up on my my store page

1649
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,080
Like I'll probably maybe I'll sell them for like 20 bucks

1650
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:56,240
Maybe I'll sell them for like 20 bucks on the store page and then like they're 15 if you get them through

1651
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,960
A Kickstarter or something

1652
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,280
Uh

1653
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,160
Or I don't know. I'm not sure

1654
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,320
I'm not sure if there would be any

1655
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:13,120
I mean, maybe once in a maybe once in a while. Maybe like once a month. I could see somebody some random person being like, hey

1656
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,080
I'll buy one

1657
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
Okay, I like, you know people buy

1658
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,720
the the the the

1659
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:24,480
People buy during a Kickstarter because it's like, oh, this is an event like this is this is a thing

1660
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,600
This is this is a one-time thing. It's happening right now. I have to buy this comic right now

1661
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,360
Right. I feel like even if I did list them on my store page

1662
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,480
I don't think it would vastly increase

1663
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,480
Sales or anything, but I probably should do it anyway. Why not?

1664
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:46,560
What's what's the downside? You know, um, if if like sending comics doesn't sound super interesting to you you could like, um

1665
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,520
One of my buddies I got a friend of mine. His name is nick

1666
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,320
Um, I forget I forget his twitter handle, but I'll look it up right now and tell you guys

1667
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:59,520
But um, he made these little postcards for villain verse and he gives them out at his booth

1668
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:03,120
And it's like like the like check it out looking at them

1669
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,760
Little postcards. Yeah, there's little postcards. So it has like the cover

1670
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,440
This is a new cover that I read. I drew a new cover for the prologue

1671
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,200
And in the back it has the the the chick track comic

1672
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,960
So you just give these out to people, you know

1673
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,840
Yeah

1674
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,840
I don't know. I guess I'm

1675
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,480
When you're sitting there when you're sitting there at your little booth or whatever

1676
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,120
People at least this was my experience at mice and I feel like it's

1677
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,120
What I feel like I've seen it happen at other cons too

1678
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,640
Like people are there and they're asking you about your comic, right? Yeah. Yeah

1679
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,760
Yeah, they want to know

1680
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,040
about that

1681
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,720
uh, and like that's

1682
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:52,560
Mainly what I want to be talking about is like I want to tell them what I do and what I'm doing here

1683
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,720
Because if they're here to talk to me about my stuff

1684
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,760
I'm gonna pitch I'm gonna I'm gonna pitch him on my stuff. No, I got you. You know what I mean? I got you

1685
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:06,320
Yeah, that's my buddy, uh, Nick's art corner. Um, he's the guy who made these postcards. He's pretty cool to check out his comic

1686
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,400
as well

1687
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,120
But uh, it looks he's art looks pretty good, right?

1688
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,800
but um

1689
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,120
What I was gonna say is that the strategy that like I I saw was kind of like

1690
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,160
I was kind of doing like a car salesman strategy

1691
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,800
Almost or like you ever been to like a shopping center and they have those little kiosks boost

1692
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,520
Booth where it's like a guy like and he has that like

1693
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,240
Product that cleans your shoes and when he sees you looking at his booth

1694
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:38,560
He calls you over to come to him. You don't want to talk about this is a very specific thing

1695
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,480
Uh, and then he and then he accidentally like drops a bunch of like

1696
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:47,200
A bunch of like diarrhea on your shoes and he's like, oh, let me get that out for you, sir

1697
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:51,200
I have just the thing basically that's kind of what I was doing because at first um

1698
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,480
To kind of attract people to my booth was if anyone walked by I told them like here. Here's the chick track. It's free

1699
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:01,200
Right, and I just give I give everyone a chick track and I ran out of chick tracks like the first day

1700
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,600
Which was kind of dumb what I should have done was um

1701
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,440
If people ask if I had a business card, I should have just given the chick track

1702
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:12,160
Because that's kind of a little more memorable is to get a little comic than like a business card

1703
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,240
um, I was

1704
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,240
Because I was at uh, I was at uh

1705
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,040
anthra new england last weekend and

1706
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,760
Yeah, one thing that I thought of was like I should make business cards or I should make something

1707
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,320
Uh like that

1708
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,320
um

1709
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,000
Yeah, it's it's helpful might not be might not might not be black. I think a black business

1710
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:38,560
Might be black like my soul. You see much much like my soul much much like that in a similar

1711
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:43,520
Yeah, um the second day everyone kept asking me for business cards, but I ran out of like the chick track

1712
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,520
so what I did was I just kind of like

1713
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,080
I um, I just took like one of my I took my lint my luna sticker inventory

1714
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:55,920
And I just wrote my my handle on the back and I wrote villain verse and I just gave it out to anyone who asked for like a business card

1715
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,080
um, yeah

1716
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,600
but um

1717
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,400
But people um what I noticed what I did was that um

1718
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:08,080
I would kind of just use like uh like free stuff to entice people to come to my booth like my friend nick

1719
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,560
Also gave me some postcards for his comic and I would give those out. I'd be like hey man

1720
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:16,640
I'd be anyone's walking by like walking by be like hey, man. Uh here this is free

1721
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,680
Right and and I'm like this is my buddy's comic. You should check it out

1722
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:25,920
That's like all I say about the postcard and then after I say that I say like and this is my comic and I pull out the villain verse

1723
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:30,240
That's on display and I tell them to like you know flip you can flip through that if you want to check check it out, right?

1724
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,760
Uh, you got it. You got a sucker. You got a sucker punch him right exactly

1725
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:40,160
So I I pulled them in and I just gave them the quick I gave them the quick uh like just elevator pitch of how it goes

1726
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:43,920
Um, I point out things in the comic like in the pro level like yeah

1727
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,920
This guy right here this guy's like evilest guy in the universe

1728
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,560
He's so evil the devil shows up to fight him in the prologue

1729
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,640
And

1730
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:54,080
Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of thing you want you want people to be like it

1731
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,920
And that's also kind of like how you can tell if they sound interested in it

1732
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,760
Because like if you say like oh, yeah, the devil shows up and they're like what?

1733
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,600
What?

1734
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:09,920
No way not not not old bls above right exactly, but if they don't that old scratch himself

1735
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,600
If they if they don't say anything during that part you they're not interested

1736
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,560
If you yeah, so so so depending on their reaction if they sound interested

1737
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,360
I keep going and like and I try to sell it more on the book

1738
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:27,840
But if they sound uninterested I just kind of cut the pitch short and just say like

1739
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,880
I I go I go to my other things a lot of people kind of just like supporting local artists, right?

1740
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:38,400
So you got to mention like yeah, yeah, you got to mention like that you make the you made the book all by yourself

1741
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,560
And that's your local that's your local artist because people just like

1742
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:47,680
They might not like really dig the story, but they might like the idea of just supporting local artists, right?

1743
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,720
and um, I think a bunch of people that bought books for me at mice were just like

1744
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,520
They were kind of yeah, they were kind of just there to buy everything they were kind of just there to

1745
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:04,800
Support everybody there just whatever anyone's got like yeah, I'll take one. I'll check it out later. Maybe but like I'm here to

1746
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,360
I'm here to spread money around and the

1747
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,160
local indie scene

1748
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,920
Yeah, that's that's that's epic. That's that's epic of them

1749
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Um, I also thought of another strategy that was kind of too late to do because I already had my price on my on my shelf

1750
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,680
How much everything cost but um my strategy was to

1751
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,400
I said I'm selling the book for 17 bucks, but um

1752
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,280
Yeah, I mean it's it's a it's a hefty

1753
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,680
It's a hefty ish book, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's like 42 pages

1754
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:41,600
But but what I should have done was sold the book for 20 bucks and as I'm going for the elevator pitch

1755
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:47,440
I tell them like, you know what dude? I'm down to sell this to you for 17 bucks like you don't gotta pay the 20

1756
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:54,000
To make it seem like they're getting a deal right do the do the car the car salesman singing dance, right?

1757
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:00,720
Yeah, I mean, why not? It's a it's a nice little uh, I think probably some people

1758
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:07,360
I think probably some there might be a few people who'd be like, uh, well if it's oh, he's giving me a discount. Ah, well

1759
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,240
Right, exactly. Yeah

1760
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,880
I guess I guess I can't

1761
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,440
I can't not I can't not do I think you know, I think I sold

1762
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:21,280
I think if I remember correctly at mini mice I sold my books for less

1763
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,840
I think I was selling them for 10

1764
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Each, uh, which is less than than I was selling them for in Kickstarter. Right, uh, which is okay

1765
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,440
I mean, they were it's still a profit, but like

1766
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:37,280
Yeah, I sold them for I sold them for cheap. I sold them for cheap there

1767
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,360
Uh, just just because I wanted people to buy them just so that I wanted to move

1768
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:46,400
Um product and I get and I guess it worked more or less another thing

1769
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,800
that like

1770
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,800
Should have been kind of obvious

1771
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,400
From the get-go like this is the most obvious thing ever

1772
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,280
When it comes to like selling at a convention

1773
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:02,880
Is that people are attracted to the things they already like, you know, so

1774
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,880
Um, for example, there was a guy next to us

1775
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,680
Who who does this kind of like?

1776
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,680
um

1777
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,880
He does like

1778
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:18,560
He he draw he recreates like images of characters from like video games or anime

1779
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:22,400
But he uses like an ink brush to to do the art, right?

1780
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:29,360
And it's literally just like it literally just looks like he printed out these images

1781
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:35,440
And he just like just clicked on the ink brush filter on like photoshop or something

1782
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,400
But he sells like he sells these like huge like look, I'm gonna I'll show you a picture of this guy

1783
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,960
But he was like right next to us and I don't even know if I want to call it like uh

1784
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,040
I don't even know if I want to call it like an art style

1785
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:51,200
It's more like an art filter that this guy is doing these like pieces with because look at that

1786
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:58,320
That just looks like the that just looks like the official art, but he just recreated in ink brushes, right?

1787
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:04,560
He doesn't like with physical ink. Well, I think he says he does

1788
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,720
I I didn't really talk. I didn't really talk to him because I wasn't like

1789
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,400
I was on the other side of the table and I wasn't that close like next to him

1790
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:16,320
But it just looks like it looks like official art, but he just

1791
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:19,120
Ink brushed. Yeah, right

1792
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:22,880
If he's doing it with like it doesn't look very difficult to do something like this

1793
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,680
Yeah, I

1794
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,880
I guess if he's doing it with like physical ink

1795
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:34,480
On like parchment or something. I guess I can appreciate why someone would buy it because it's like, oh, yeah

1796
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,320
It's this image, but it's like in a in a in a new meat. It's been transferred to a new medium. It's a physical piece

1797
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,840
Whatever if he's just doing this with like with like photo filters or whatever then like

1798
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,240
I guess I could under I guess I could still understand someone buying it

1799
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,360
But I I'm pretty sure like this is what I think he does like he I think he probably

1800
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:03,120
I think he on prints out the image and he paints over it because that's what it looks like it just looks like he's like

1801
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:10,960
If he's physically print if he's physically like using actual ink and like actually brushing it on to the canvas then I

1802
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,280
I respect the

1803
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,320
I respect the yet. He's like crafting something

1804
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:22,160
Right and like and I was thinking like this is like so like this is like so basic, you know

1805
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:24,720
This is like so like normie core, you know, it's like the average

1806
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:30,240
Yeah, the average nerd, right? But then I saw I mean, that's how you sell shit, right? And I'd be in

1807
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:35,600
Yeah, and then I saw him like have a picture of devil man and I was like, oh, it looks pretty badass

1808
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,400
And I was like dammit. He got me. He got me

1809
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:43,280
Because like he just froze out this like wide net of like just

1810
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,360
Everything that people likes and he probably does gang clusters

1811
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,600
His his booth was like super popular. I could see it. I could see it selling. Yeah

1812
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:57,040
It's definitely the sort of thing. This is this is the kind of thing that really bores doing it myself

1813
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,400
but like it's

1814
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:02,720
Yeah, uh, specifically what he's doing is just like tracing or like copying

1815
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,560
existing art

1816
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,560
I would like

1817
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,640
I would prefer to draw it myself

1818
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,160
If I'm going to draw a bunch of popular characters, but like even that

1819
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,960
Is like, uh, but I want to draw my thing though

1820
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:21,360
This is time I could spend doing my thing and then I nobody pays. I mean like I was like, uh, I guess because if I were to like

1821
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:27,200
Buy a piece of art like if someone like um if ben saint drew popular character mario

1822
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:33,280
I want I want that ben saint kind of like flavor because that's why I would come to ben saint to draw like mario

1823
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:37,760
Right, I wouldn't want to just draw like here's the brawl render and I just drew over it

1824
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,320
right

1825
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:44,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. I mean I I agree. Well, I agree

1826
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,280
but uh, you know

1827
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:51,840
That's not like nothing against this guy like nothing against this guy. He he probably

1828
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:55,040
Potentially, I'm pretty sure makes more money than me doing this

1829
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,640
I think I think that that's a different

1830
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:02,800
What you're describing is a different kind of thing. These are not like

1831
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,760
This is not a commission. This is a this is a

1832
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,920
This is a print, but it's got a sort of a different

1833
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,200
I don't know. It's got you got the ink brush filter and people people love that a different medium

1834
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,400
It looks edgy. It looks cool. You know, you put that on get it

1835
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,880
Yeah, I mean nintendo wouldn't be selling like a mario that looks like that

1836
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:29,600
And if you wanted that on your wall, where else are you gonna? Yeah, I want him to do exactly if he did joker

1837
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,600
I'd put that on my wall

1838
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,760
You got heat. You got heath ledger's joker. Yeah, I got

1839
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,480
I want to get Joaquin Phoenix joker on the wall. Joaquin Phoenix joker

1840
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,840
Who would win in a fight Joaquin Phoenix joker or Heath Ledger joker?

1841
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:49,760
Yeah, I know I already I knew the answer as I was asking it, but I had to finish the question

1842
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,720
um

1843
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,320
What I was gonna see yeah

1844
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:59,840
Yeah, what I was gonna say is that like you need like you unironically need something like this at your booth

1845
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,680
You want to draw attention?

1846
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:05,200
Because I saw a bunch of other people doing it too where they have like little prints of like

1847
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,960
Just like popular characters that like people like right

1848
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:13,440
And you would sell those right or you were just enticed people with those like yeah, here's my

1849
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,800
Here's the stuff based on popular franchise, but here's like my original stuff, you know

1850
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,760
I saw a tweet this week

1851
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,880
It was a screenshot of a tumblr post. It was two posts by the same guy and and i'm gonna try to remember and paraphrase it

1852
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,400
it was like

1853
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,840
It was something like

1854
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,840
I know this guy who

1855
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:40,080
Always gets girls. He's always getting girls to come to come to his house to come over to his house

1856
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:43,280
by say by saying by saying

1857
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:50,560
Oh, can't oh, I'm so glad I have stew at home like mm. Can't wait to go home and eat some of that stew

1858
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,600
and then

1859
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,200
And the worst part is

1860
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:00,800
And the yeah, and the worst part is I was um when I'm I'm there at his house and I'm eating stew and I'm like damn

1861
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,880
It worked on me too

1862
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:08,160
So this this this these ink prints are this guy's stew, you know, everybody everybody loves stew

1863
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:12,960
Why wouldn't you why wouldn't you want to have some stew? He's the stew maker. He's the stew artist

1864
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,200
Exactly, right right instead of calling himself shame

1865
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,920
Shane sarr

1866
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,160
He should call himself stew art

1867
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,120
It's like that's like the name of this guy's like uh stuff

1868
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1869
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:33,760
So I think well, I'm glad glad he's working. Yeah, he's fill it. He's filling it. He's filling the demand

1870
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,080
I guess yeah, I think for my next convention. I'm gonna try to like I have this like little sketchbook

1871
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,560
And I think I'm just gonna just fill it up with like

1872
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:44,480
drawings of characters popular characters people like

1873
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:50,240
I mean, I like a lot of popular characters. So I that was just throwing a couple of throwing like a lot of people I like

1874
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:57,600
In that I drew Gino once I drew Gino once I should make prints of that one time. I drew Gino does it does it look good

1875
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,640
Yeah, it was pretty good. Oh, can I see it? Where is it? Where can I see it?

1876
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:08,720
Oh god, uh, if you let's see, uh, if you search twitter, let me try and find it on twitter

1877
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:11,520
It's all so ugly

1878
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,080
Gino

1879
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:18,320
Okay, I put yeah, I posted it on twitter somewhere. Okay, you post your Gino, but um

1880
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,320
Um

1881
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:27,120
Mecha Godzilla was also at the convention here. Check it out. No shit. Mecha. Yeah, he's right there. There he is. There he is

1882
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,120
That's mecha Godzilla. You fucking shut up

1883
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,240
Holy, I thought he was holding the chainsaw game

1884
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,440
Crap. No, that's a chainsaw man cosplayer. Oh, this is good Ben. Yeah, you should make prints of this

1885
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,680
I think yeah, I think this is pretty good

1886
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:43,520
I think the piggies will slop this up if you make pictures of it. They will

1887
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:45,760
They would eat this up. They'll be like Gino

1888
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:49,680
And I want and I want their slop. I want them to slop all over me

1889
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,920
There's gonna be a all over me for Gino, baby

Isn't that so there isn't that what they do to clams like when they open them and they like take out the meat

They shelf them or they shuck them. Yeah, they shulk it right out of there. They shuck them

1903
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:54,800
Wait, shuck them good. They shulk. No. No, it's help. No, they shuck them

1904
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,600
No, it's help is the manga

01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:05,040
The infamous oyster shucking manga draw some help help is help is the manga help is the manga about the

01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:11,440
About the mortal the one mortal guy the big fucking Hercules mortal guy who goes to the demon world

01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,520
To compete in the demon olympics to choose the new demon president

1908
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:22,160
Uh, and everyone loves him. I remember that because he because he's the human who runs on the i hate humans platform

1909
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,680
And all the demons are like hell. Yeah, bro. We hate humans too

1910
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:31,920
We're gonna we're gonna build the wall keep all the humans out from our own keep all those filthy humans out exactly

1911
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,480
We're gonna build the ceiling. We're gonna make the humans pay for it

1912
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,600
Um, yeah

1913
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:44,560
So, um, also at this convention. There was this a rubin s gentleman dressed up like a frappy from my hero academia

1914
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,640
You know the the fraud girl

1915
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:52,480
Yeah, yeah, so he was dressed up like like her and this guy like he came by my booth and we talked

1916
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,960
And he gave me this sticker that he made

1917
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:00,560
Of this this guy is like the antagonist of his like comic, but he never told me where to find his comic

1918
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:05,040
So if anyone knows like I love this sticker, by the way

1919
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:11,600
This reminds me of I don't know remember one time, um

1920
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,400
I think I talked about it on one one episode

1921
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,960
So I wouldn't blame me if you didn't know what i'm talking about but crack gave me a like

1922
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:20,800
scrawled

1923
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,360
drawing on like a piece of brown paper bag

1924
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,080
That he got from like a

1925
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:34,320
Artist's convention for like mentally challenged people or something like outsider artists with like who were like from like an

1926
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,320
They're like institutionalized

1927
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:41,600
Oh, some guy drew his like edgy sona his edgy like shadow the hedgehog guy

1928
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:46,480
Complaining about some dude. He knew who who didn't bail him out of jail one time

1929
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:52,560
Yeah, that that's what this this looks like that sounds like art right that that sounds so fucking cool

1930
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:56,480
I should like it was so cool. I should it is I have it here in my

1931
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:00,160
Well, it's not hanging up. I should hang it up. I don't know why I didn't hang it up

1932
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:06,640
It's on my shelf. I should commission like some x con to draw like a cover for villain verse because it'd be kind of cool

1933
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,720
Like oh at x con cover

1934
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:10,960
right

1935
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,160
Yeah

1936
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:15,200
Yeah, that's an angle. Yeah, that's a gimmick. I need um

1937
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,520
But I think I was I need to like make my booth kind of stand out a little bit more

1938
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:24,000
Um, I all the other booths had like this whole giant like there there was a booth next to us

1939
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,560
that had this whole like

1940
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,560
these these rates had these like

1941
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:35,760
Metal grates around their like booth with all their like images like it was like um display images for all the prints they sell

1942
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:40,800
Right and like that's like easy and identifiable. Like if you see it across the room

1943
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,800
You see your favorite anime character, right?

1944
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:47,520
And I and and the thing is like I don't necessarily draw popular stuff

1945
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:52,480
I always want to push my original stuff, right? But yeah, but if you had like

1946
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:59,120
Let's say you're um, let's say the stuff you made had like a popular character on it

1947
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,280
And if you could find a way to kind of display it

1948
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,120
Out there that could attract like like people, you know

1949
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,280
um

1950
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:13,360
You know what you should have you should like 3d print or otherwise try to find a way to like create that

1951
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:17,760
Golden skull medallion necklace thing. Oh, yeah. Oh, actually

1952
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:22,960
At the 99 cent store, um, there was like a plastic like

1953
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:29,200
Skull like chain that was like a skull with the crossbones like that looked very similar to that

1954
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,440
And I was like, oh, I should buy this and like use like gold spray paint

1955
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:37,440
To like make it and then like make a bunch of fake jewels and put it on it, you know

1956
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,080
Because that'd be pretty fucking good

1957
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,520
A guy who was selling video games

1958
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:47,920
At uh, anthra new england from whom I purchased did I meant

1959
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:52,480
Did I say what I bought a copy of well neither of you guys were on last episode?

1960
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,840
So you don't know what uh, yeah, I purchased a copy of bart's nightmare for the super nintendo

1961
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:01,120
Uh for 30 dollars, which is a reasonable price

1962
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,840
Uh, I

1963
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,960
I looked on amazon to make sure that I wasn't being ripped off

1964
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,520
Uh, it was not

1965
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:17,760
Bought a copy of bart's nightmare. He had uh, anyway, he had uh, he had 3d printed uh stuff there. He was selling some 3d printed

1966
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:25,040
Pokemon stuff. He had 3d printed cubone skulls. He had 3d printed porygons shiny and non shiny

1967
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:29,520
He had a couple of different things. I forget there were more there wasn't all pokemon

1968
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:33,360
But yeah, he just had a bunch of junk that he 3d printed it. It's like hell

1969
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,240
Hell yeah

1970
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:40,080
For the for the porygon it worked perfectly like it looked digital and like

1971
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,880
Yeah, looks like a porygon

1972
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:48,640
That's that's pretty bad for the didn't look bad for the cubone skull either. It was it. I was like damn

1973
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,360
Look at all this shit

1974
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,680
It looks neat looks kind of neat actually

1975
02:03:54,320 --> 02:04:00,480
I'm thinking about um getting one of those big like cardboard like you know how people could just print anything on a cardboard stand

1976
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,720
Right

1977
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,680
Yeah, like we did with uh, gino at uh

1978
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:11,440
At the rad con for rad con four. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I was thinking I was trying to think which number it was

1979
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:15,920
I want to like do this into a 3d stand and put it uh to put it on my boof

1980
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,200
But looking at this image right now

1981
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,120
Yeah, what will we have on the paper? Oh villain verse

1982
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,640
Read read villain verse. No, I cut it out

1983
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:35,680
So I can make it a stand that he's like holding villain verse copies so people can just like grab them and check them out

1984
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:41,760
Right, that would work really well actually. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's really funny. That's really funny

1985
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,720
Um, I might just I might just recreate it. Maybe make it everybody would be talking

1986
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:52,880
Everybody would be talking about did you see the Kanye boof? Did you see that guy with the Kanye standee?

1987
02:04:52,960 --> 02:05:00,240
Yeah, I'm thinking I might get like maybe negative attention if I use just Kanye there

1988
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:05,520
But um, uh, isn't isn't this like a meme? I think it'll

1989
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:11,200
Meme value, right? It's still it's still black. It's still black history month. So you can still use them after that

1990
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:15,040
You're not allowed. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. But um, I'm thinking maybe like, um

1991
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:19,680
Boss of the clown and like it's it is like a little stand where I put my comics

1992
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:25,120
Because um, hopefully by the next convention that I'm doing which is gonna be like in april

1993
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,400
um, there is another comic I want to like

1994
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,200
Make because I think it might get like

1995
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,080
A lot of eyes on me. That's kind of like a meme, you know, like I'm thinking like

1996
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:38,880
um, I need to do my own like

1997
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,760
Mr. Boo eyes on me final fantasy 8

1998
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,960
If I if I were gonna talk about the Kanye song eyes on me

1999
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,200
No, which is final fantasy final fantasy 8. That's yeah

2000
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:54,400
That's the song that plays when they're in space and they have the romantic

2001
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:59,280
See squall they save someone save someone from dying in space

2002
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,760
And then they're like, oh now we're in a spaceship. Oh, we were gonna die. We didn't die

2003
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,680
And they sing a little song. Okay. Okay, shut up. Okay. There is shut up

2004
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:13,520

2008
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:36,880
Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, I guess it's I guess it's a tried and true formula, right

02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:12,160
Check it out. Um, first episode I got tectonic improv and a king protus

2016
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,880
Remember those guys. Yeah. Yeah. This guy's pretty cool. This guy's pretty baller

2017
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:22,880
Those guys are pretty they're pretty quirked up white boys with a little bit of swag both of them. Yeah

2018
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,920
But um, what are you saying is yeah, I'm gonna I've told other people about this

2019
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,000
But what I want to do is I want to do

2020
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,800
a comic book adaptation

2021
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,720
Of the opera of paglacci, right?

2022
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,480
But I want to replace all the characters with a ronald mcdonald the characters

2023
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,160
Because I think I think that would be pretty stubborn

2024
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:53,840
And I don't know the story of paliachi. Oh, well, you know, um, you seen like all the parodies, right?

2025
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:56,240
Where it's like a clown like doing opera, right?

2026
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,040
Sure

2027
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:04,640
Yeah, the paglacci story is very simple. It's very short and there's only two acts and it all happens in a span of a day

2028
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:09,200
Um, but basically this this clown this clown

2029
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,360
gets cucked

2030
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:14,160
This this actually happens. He gets cucked, of course

2031
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:20,640
And then um, and then the second act becomes like a this meta this meta kind of thing about him getting cucked

2032
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,960
And it ends in tragedy. So he gets cucked the whole time

2033
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:29,040
He he finds out he's been getting cucked

2034
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:31,040
Oh

2035
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,920
Yeah, he finds out he's been getting cucked and then after he finds out he's been getting cucked

2036
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
He sings that iconic opera song

2037
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:43,520
That that's all about like the song is basically like, oh, you got it. You got to laugh paglacci

2038
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,960
You got to laugh because the show has to go on even though you're sad even though your heart is broken

2039
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,000
You got to laugh inside my heart is breaking

2040
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:53,920
My makeup may be flaking, but my smile

2041
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:57,600
Still stays on right on ironically

2042
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,120
Of course, unironically. Yes. That is what that song is

2043
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,120
and um

2044
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:08,080
And because like the thing is that he's like a he's like a he has a comedy troupe and they go from town to town

2045
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,240
And he's considered like the king of the clowns, right?

2046
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:12,080
and um

2047
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:17,360
And he comes into this this town and like everyone's happy and but then he finds out that his like his um,

2048
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:20,960
Bright to be is actually has a secret lover in this town, right?

2049
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:26,240
Right. Yeah, and then he goes to the doctor and he says doctor. I'm depressed and the doctor says

2050
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:32,960
Hey, polyaches in town. Hey, that that scene doesn't I actually don't know where that's from that scene is not famous

2051
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,960
Famous scene from the opera like doctor

2052
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,840
doctor, I'm depressed, uh

2053
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:44,720
This might cheer you up. There's like webcom. They call the villain verse. Um, it's pretty funny doctor

2054
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:47,200
I am

2055
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:49,520
No, but but but doctor. I fucking hate

2056
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,360
The villain verse

2057
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,760
Sucks

2058
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:09,040
No, no twist no twist like but doctor that webcomic blows. Oh, sorry. Well, no, no joke doctor

2059
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:12,000
But I rather read slime in punishment. They read villain verse

2060
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:14,720
Oh god, no

2061
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:20,880
But um, yeah, so the second after he finds out he gets cooked and he sings the the iconic song

2062
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,480
Um, the second act is like his comedy troupe performing

2063
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:29,600
And it's basically a skit about a guy getting cooked. So that's the meta part

2064
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,360
Is that the second half is like a whole skit of like a guy getting cut

2065
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:39,120
But the the guy getting cut cut in the skit is like paglacci playing a person getting cut

2066
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,600
And and the the kind of thing that happens is that over the course of the skit

2067
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,200
He starts to become serious about it. Like he starts to like really like

2068
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:53,280
Like asking like who who did who did you sleep me slip sleep with who who was what's the name of your lover, right?

2069
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:55,280
and

2070
02:10:55,280 --> 02:11:00,560
And at the very end the audience doesn't know if it's serious or not they keep laughing because they think like ha this is funny

2071
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:05,280
Right. They're like ha ha. This is a pretty funny bit. I like how serious they're taking it

2072
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:11,680
It's man. Then he pulls out a gun. What a juxtaposition. This clown is asking these these hard-hitting questions

2073
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,960
right exactly and then at the very end like, um

2074
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,320
Paglacci is gonna like stab his wife to be

2075
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:24,320
Because she won't tell him the name of her of her lover, right? He's like, oh, you better tell me. I'm gonna like murder you

2076
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,200
Right, it's like it's like Othello, but with a clown right exactly

2077
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:34,720
And then like as he's about as he's as he's as he's froze his arm ready to stab her like it's gonna go in

2078
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:40,000
It's gonna plunge. She screams her last words. She screams out the name of her lover as she dies, right?

2079
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:45,840
And and then it's yeah, and then her lover shows up and then Paglacci like stabs him too, right?

2080
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,200
And everyone in the eyes are like, oh fuck. This is real and they run out

2081
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:55,440
Right and there's Paglacci like alone in the in the tent and there's I think there's other people there

2082
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:00,640
Like of the comedy trooper just looking at him and then he looked then Paglacci turns to the audience and says

2083
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:05,360
The comedy is over and then the curtains come down and that's the end of the play

2084
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:10,400
Hmm, so imagine that is Ronald McDonald. I think it'd be pretty funny

2085
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,760
Yeah, yeah

2086
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,480
Would it be I think I feel like you would need to like

2087
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:20,400
Fuss food in eyes the cooking so there's not like a person

2088
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:26,080
It's just so like you stole the the ingredients for my chicken nuggets. He's like my secret crabby patty for

2089
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:32,400
Yeah, maybe instead instead of a play. It's like a commercial like it's in a commercial or something

2090
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,000
I might

2091
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,960
I might do that the thing is that the reason why I chose the Ronald McDonald cast is because like they each

2092
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:43,760
Each like main core member of the Ronald McDonald can play a role in this

2093
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:47,840
right like um like Ronald is Paglacci and uh

2094
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:54,240
I forget the name of uh of his bride, but it's but she could be like yeah early. Yeah birdie

2095
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:59,920
And and then the guy who the guy who cucks ronald could be the hamburger, right?

2096
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:08,720
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so and and also grimace grimace could play a role too because there's actually another character who's this kind of like

2097
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,640
This kind of like I don't know if I don't want to say he's a hunchback or something

2098
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:16,000
But he has like some sort of deformity that doesn't make him attractive

2099
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:22,560
Right. Yeah, and this guy this guy actually wants to sleep with Paglacci's like wife of Paglacci's wife

2100
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:28,560
Is kind of like ew no gross stay away from me. Everybody wants right everybody wants to sleep with Paglacci's way

2101
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:35,840
And um and basically um this guy is kind of like guy who who wants to sleep with Paglacci's wife

2102
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:40,720
It's kind of like he kind of like tries to push Paglacci to the whole like murder angle

2103
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:47,360
Right because like oh if she won't if she won't have something with me. I will manipulate Paglacci to murder you in a way

2104
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,760
Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and that guy could be played by grimace

2105
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,480
Hmm. Yeah

2106
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,720
Uh, I think it's a funny idea

2107
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:59,440
I mean would it be

2108
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,520
I mean how much

2109
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,200
How how how how many pages do you how many pages? I'm gonna think maybe

2110
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:08,560
32 I'm pretty sure I can tell the story and maybe under

2111
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:14,400
Oh, that's under 35 pages. Yeah. Yeah, because the play isn't long like 10 pages a day

2112
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:20,400
Yeah, the play isn't long because um, and if I mean I'm gonna cut out all the songs

2113
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:25,120
Yeah, right. I'm just gonna just play out the general gist

2114
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:31,280
It's gonna be played pretty straight and you know, it's actually perfect about the Paglacci play is that at the start of the play

2115
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,240
Uh, one of the characters goes up on stage and explains to the audience that this isn't real

2116
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:41,440
Like it's they say that it's based on real events, but this play isn't like these are just actors by the way

2117
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,920
So if you get too invested just letting you know they're actors

2118
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,240
Right, so

2119
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:50,960
Yes, so what I was thinking is I would have grimace appear at the start of the story and say this isn't like real

2120
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:57,360
This is just a parody. These are these are just the the mcdonald mcdonald character. This isn't this is not the real ronald mcdonald

2121
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:59,280
Right, exactly. Yeah

2122
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:04,400
Honestly, I I like this idea. I think it's good. Yeah, I think you I think it's very funny, right?

2123
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:07,920
I could see you so I could see you getting I could see this being a hit

2124
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:09,600
No, I yeah, I agree

2125
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:14,640
I had this like in the back of my mind for a while now because I'm really I really like the idea of going to a con

2126
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:20,720
And I have like a little poster for it of like a sad ronald mcdonald and it just says mcplaglacci on it

2127
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,040
And people would be like what the fuck is that?

2128
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:29,680
I like it. I like it a lot. You sold me. Thank you. All right, perfect completely sold completely

2129
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:36,000
Perfect. I'm gonna try to have that done before this next con and then I'll sell it there and make a gang busters

2130
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:38,080
Hopefully what's the next con?

2131
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:40,720
What's um, it's called comic fest in san diego

2132
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:44,720
I'm actually on a wait list because um originally I thought I couldn't get in but then um

2133
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:49,280
One of our boof neighbors told us that um, oh you could you could still apply

2134
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:54,080
And they'll just put you on a wait list because apparently people just drop all the time which makes sense because at this con

2135
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:59,840
Um, there was like there was like two empty booths in our little section because they just didn't show up

2136
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:02,320
So i'm like, okay, so i'm just hoping that

2137
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:06,960
People just start dropping off the closer we get to it and then they they'll pull us in

2138
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:08,800
and um

2139
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,880
Yeah, and I think I think i'm gonna like email them again to sell them like

2140
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:19,440
Hey letting you know i'm on the wait list, but i'm i am like a local artist who makes comics and just

2141
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:22,240
just to see if like

2142
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:27,360
That gets their attention more than like look you don't need another person selling like anime prints there

2143
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,840
You know you can just have someone locally right like me

2144
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:35,760
You know maybe yeah, maybe yeah could could help. Yeah, that's the goal

2145
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,040
and I also

2146
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:42,480
And I also have a secret project much like you guys

2147
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,800
Have been talking about

2148
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:50,800
Now now it's cheesy's turn for the secret project and this might be announced sooner than anyone thinks but um

2149
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:54,400
I think I I think I cracked the code for the next hit

2150
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:56,480
um

2151
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:00,960
I'm going back to making slice of life comics. I'm making bongo and luna 2.0

2152
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:04,720
But it's not bongo and luna bongo and tuna. Yeah bongo and tuna

2153
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,240
Oh, like was it um, I forget my friends have like a parody name for the fake bongo luna

2154
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:18,400
A bingo or tango. I can't forget camera. Okay, but but basically I'm doing it's not bongo luna 2

2155
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:24,640
But it's it's gonna be kind of like a refined bongo luna. It's also gonna be gayer, right?

2156
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:30,960
Um, and and dare I say dare I say this is gonna this is gonna make a merry weather a run for his money

It's just the title of the thing. Yeah, which which which merry weather like uh

2160
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,200

I mean there's a cuz there's an internet explorer in it

2162
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,440

2177
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,520
I've learned like so much more new things

2178
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:16,640
To just pump out like yeah pump out shit faster. But yeah, this is just gonna be

But I do I do feel like now I could do

2183
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:32,560
I could draw faster I could make comics faster than I used to if I went

2184
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:37,520
If say, I don't know I made a vapors for or something, right? If I ever did that

2185
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,480
Ben you should make your own merry weather killer

2186
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:49,120
My my uh, what kind of girlfriend would it be my my dog is my girlfriend

2187
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:54,320
My mom is my girlfriend. She's also a goth male. My mom is my girlfriend

2188
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:59,840
Now there's now there's a comic my mom is my girlfriend, but I'm also her dad

2189
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,560
I saw that hazel video

2190
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:07,840
About that one manga. Do you ever watch hazel? Yeah, I love I love hazel. He's was pretty good. Um

2191
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,880
I don't want one about the kid the kid who's in love with his mom

2192
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:17,040
Yeah, because he's like secretly like the reincarnated like husband or something or some shit like that

2193
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:22,320
He's some sort of like genetic memory flashback thing going on. Yeah

2194
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:27,360
I don't know just thought that video was really funny. Yeah after watching that video

2195
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:31,280
I thought like oh man, you know, but I feel less bad about drinking off the incest more now

2196
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:36,000
Somebody else does it trans people do it too. So it's

2197
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,720
Progressive, I don't know

2198
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,720
People want to fuck their mom that's what Ben's saying

2199
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,680
That is what I said

2200
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,760
Oh christian did no

02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:03,040
All right, so just letting you know if if if pcp is too problematic for you now

2203

Um, you could always watch main character syndrome or as I like to call it the pc the pcp killer is gonna

2204
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,040
This is the name of my new podcast

It's gonna destroy

2206
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:18,880
I'm gonna finish with yeah go on to call to call to call something a pcp killer is to imply

2207
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:25,040
Like the pcp is like you could you could be so it's so frail has so few hit points

2208
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:29,280
It's it's just the slightest the slightest gusts the slightest gusts

2209
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,960
I'm gonna

2210
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:33,040
I'm we're like we're like mr. Burnt

2211
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:37,280
We're like mr. Burns with so many diseases that we we are not dying of any of them yet

2212
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:39,520
But even the slightest breeze could uh

2213
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,880
It would destroy everything. Yeah, it's um, I'm gonna finish what tricks he started

2214
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,720
Please

2215
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:49,920
Finally

2216
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,040
um

2217
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,560
Okay, uh

2218
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:57,760
Well, I don't want to rush anyone, but I we've been going for two and a half hours and I feel like voicemails are

2219
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:03,200
Coming soon. Yeah, I agree. I'm um, what do you what do you think gib?

2220
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Yes

2221
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:10,320
I don't really have too much else to say

2222
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:14,320
Because I have the topic the topic, but I could leave it for next time

2223
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:17,520
No, you could go ahead and say it if you want to say it

2224
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:24,400
This week well, it's just about the I've been playing a video game. I've been playing animal crossing pocket camp, but like

2225
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:27,920
It's not really that interesting wait. Um

2226
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:34,080
I don't know what pocket. It's the it's the mobile the mobile version of animal crossing, which is basically exactly the same

2227
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,080
Is it new? It's fun

2228
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:41,680
It's been out for a while. I think you played the old animal crossings, right like before new leaf

2229
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,640
Or no before new horizons

2230
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:52,640
I've never played a single animal. Oh, okay. Haha. So so uh pocket pocket dimension. What did you call it?

2231
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:58,720
Animal crossing pocket camp is so pocket camp is identity. You're saying it's very much like

2232
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:00,720
Ah

2233
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:06,720
Well from from from my understanding you gather things you shake trees you fish and you catch bugs

2234
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:09,200
And then you give it to animals and they say wow, thanks

2235
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:15,200
Yeah, and then you become friends with them and then you invite them to your campsite and you can craft furniture that they like and then

2236
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:21,120
They're like you put a microphone down. They sing at it. It's cute. It's been consuming my life

2237
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,120
It's this all I have to say about it really

2238
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:28,640
It must be it must have some differences from new horizons, right?

2239
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:37,120
I would yeah, I mean new horizons you have an island and you can like sculpt it. Yeah in in pocket camp you have

2240
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,920
like a grid based

2241
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:41,760
campsite and

2242
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:43,760
You can put tents down

2243
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:49,280
Uh two different like amenities and then a bunch of like furniture in this large area

2244
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,840
And then you can invite like 10 animals

2245
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:57,840
10 I think animals at a time can just be in there just hanging out and talking

2246
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:04,720
Chatting and like eating the food nice and you get like little quests to get like oh, I need like

2247
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:10,000
A fucking stick insect you got any of those and I do and I give it to them and they say wow

2248
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,760
It's great

2249
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:16,720
Whoa, I love it. And there's a little that

2250
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,680
There's a little garden to the side where you can like

2251
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:24,880
Make flowers and like cross pollinate them to get special seeds sure

2252
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,200
Oh

2253
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,200
It's fun

2254
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,760
You know what didn't um

2255
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:37,280
Didn't just a couple of like hours ago the new pokemons got announced for the next gen

2256
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:42,000
The next generation of pokemons. Oh, but they just but they just released a new pokeman

2257
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:48,960
They they um, I think well, they said that's that's pokemon legends arcades. So I guess it's like, uh,

2258
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:53,840
This is like the next one. No, this is like the next installment after sort of starting shield

2259
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:58,560
Marin said they just announced pokemon rowdy and pokemon killer. I thought he was lying

2260
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:04,320
Uh, it's kind of that it's scarlet and violet. Yeah, it's a red and purple. I am

2261
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:12,640
Scarlet and violet, huh? Have you seen the news new starters for it? I'm just seeing them right now and uh

2262
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,080
Is it is it just me?

2263
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:21,360
But didn't we are like when I first saw those I thought like they were like fan pokemon or something

2264
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:25,520
But then when I find out they're all pokemon look like fan pokemon these days

2265
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:26,800
um

2266
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:30,640
Right, but like to me they they look like pokemons that we that already exist like

2267
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,600
Don't we don't these pokemons already exist in the game?

2268
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,960
The they okay the the duck looks exactly like ducklet

2269
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:41,440
Right. Yeah, that that one looks like one that already exists for sure. Um, and the cat

2270
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:44,560
I know that ducks sometimes have like the funny afro

2271
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,560
And I see it and I like haha that's funny, but like it is just a duck

2272
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,760
It's they've done that already

2273
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:57,760
I didn't isn't the cat looks like a lot like the other cat starter. Uh, the one that eventually comes

2274
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:03,040
Yeah, yeah, like it looks it does kind of look like it just looks like green litten and it's like uh

2275
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,640
It looks a bit like yeah

2276
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:09,760
And then the uh, the middle guy the fire starter

2277
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:16,640
Um looks like an apple. Yeah, he's like a sliced in half apple. He looks like he looks like the little dinosaurs from bubble bobble

2278
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,240
Yeah

2279
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,240
Yeah

2280
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:22,240
They just feel like pokemon. We already got

2281
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:27,680
Whatever they do a little bit. I mean, isn't there like literally a pokemon that is just an apple

2282
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:31,360
Oh, there's appleton appleton and uh

2283
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:38,240
Yeah, there were some gen six or seven. There were some gen seven pokemon that are just apple apple dragons

2284
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,600
Yeah, yeah

2285
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:47,360
Um, there's yet another apple looking guy. I I

2286
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:54,000
I guess I'm I don't know if I guess I'm curious like why the fire guy is a is a plant

2287
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:57,760
That's that's unusual, but like sure whatever

2288
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:05,120
Um, yeah, I know the new game takes place in some sort of like spanish inspired like country or something

2289
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,680
um

2290
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,680
So maybe something to do

2291
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,360
I'm gonna do it there. I mean, I don't know. I haven't played a pokemon game since

2292
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:16,320
soul silver

2293
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:22,080
I haven't played a pokemon game since sun and moon. I haven't yeah, I haven't played one since

2294
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:26,800
Haven't played one since sun and moon. Haven't played a good one since black two

2295
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,600
Uh, or white two

2296
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,800
I might I might

2297
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:38,160
I played I played black and and then I and then I played white two

2298
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,560
Uh, yeah

2299
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:43,600
I might I might play uh with platinum

2300
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:48,400
I kind of want to play platinum at some point. Uh, I might do that in the future

2301
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:54,240
Uh, so I probably won't play these unless everyone says like holy shit. They revolutionized it

2302
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:57,520
I was I mean people people say that about arceus

2303
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:00,960
Yeah, they they love that game, but like yeah

2304
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:06,080
See seeing people really like our arceus made me a little bit like

2305
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:09,760
Kind of kind of want to try it because like it's it seems like

2306
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:15,360
People liked it a lot and it did look a little bit different and like yeah, that's kind of what I

2307
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:19,600
It's kind of what I was hoping for in a pokemon game. So I don't know

2308
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,960
But I don't know to switch. So like whatever

2309
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:25,600
What am I gonna do nothing? It's it's

2310
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:32,560
Like I know pokemon goes like the pokemon game on mobile and I guess they have a few other like mini game games, but like

2311
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,240
I feel like it wouldn't be very difficult to make

2312
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:41,120
An a 3ds style pokemon game for mobile

2313
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:45,600
You know like like like x and y sort of level of 3d

2314
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:52,560
I just would not buy a switch because it's a fucking thing I have to get

2315
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:56,480
But the the reason I get animal crossing pocket camp is because I just download it

2316
02:28:56,800 --> 02:29:01,520
I was like, I wonder if there's an animal crossing game that I can play on my phone right now and there is and it was great

2317
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:05,520
Everything should be on phones. I am a fucking mobile gamer

2318
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:09,040
You know, I'll I'll say

2319
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,960
I'll

2320
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:14,640
These these pokemon these these starters. They don't really look like pokemon

2321
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:20,000
They have the bit of like look like digimon syndrome to me or they look like they look like uh

2322
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,280
I mean whatever

2323
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:27,360
That's that's fine. That's not that bad. They look I like them better than

2324
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:31,120
Uh groovy sobble and uh score bunny for sure

2325
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:37,440
I yeah, I remember we had a very similar problem to those designs. Their silhouettes look too familiar

2326
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:42,720
They look yeah, they really all look like they're like the same base creature. That's just like different color

2327
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:47,520
Yeah, yeah, that I I hated that. Yeah here at least it's like

2328
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:52,640
Um, like one's like a four-layed creature one is like two the other one is two

2329
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,720
But it has like longer arms

2330
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:58,720
And the head shape is different. Yeah, there's there's more variety in their silhouettes, which I like

2331
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:01,760
But the but the little kind of I don't know they

2332
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:08,000
I don't know like what I think like what's the point if I can play about pokemon. I don't play the games

2333
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:13,520
Yeah, um people already there's already like 10 million fan art for all these characters

2334
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:18,800
I saw I saw way more. I had to scroll past a silhouette fan art before I found the official images

2335
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:21,360
I'm looking I'm looking at this

2336
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,040
Okay, here's here's my problem. Um

2337
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,040
Um

2338
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:34,720
The the new trainers uh their hat uh way worse than the hat that the sword and shield trainer

2339
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,040
Was there look uh, they look too young

2340
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:42,320
The what is the the the the girl is supposed to be 10 I may

2341
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,200
The girl in sword and shield was wearing

2342
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:52,560
The girl in sword and shield was wearing that like flat green, uh, scottish hat the like the clod clod hopper or something

2343
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:56,080
It's called you know what I mean that was way cuter. What is this fucking?

2344
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,880
Cowboy hat

2345
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:01,200
Too much like uh like school children

2346
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:07,920
Uh, they are dressed. They are dressed like school the school uniform. I'm gonna I'm gonna post I guess in recent years

2347
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,960
It's been a bit ambiguous the age like it's always been

2348
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,440
Initially it's like oh when you're 10 you go out and you do your pokemon adventure. You just don't know

2349
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:17,120
playing the game

2350

2366
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:27,280
She still makes the rounds. I I see you could sort of you could sort of imagine. She was any age really like she's

2367
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:29,600
You know, she's an anime character. She doesn't look

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't wait till they start dropping the gym leaders to see which one is going to be the the porn gym leader

2372
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:53,200

02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,360
Yeah, exactly. Yeah

2405
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:13,760
True. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So just check it out. Um,

2406
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:17,600
Yeah, I I mostly just do porn commissions nowadays

2407
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:19,200
um

2408
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:25,040
You should uh, you should everyone out there should uh follow me on the creamy pasta tca commissioned me

2409
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:27,120
I am currently

2410
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:32,800
About to be laid on my rent and also, um, I mean, I guess I'll make this a quick story before we go into the

2411
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:37,200
Into the questions, but um, yeah, yeah, I so

2412
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:42,480
Guess who owes like a shitload of debt because uh, one of my roommates just disappeared

2413
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:48,400
They just disappeared in November rents. Yes. He bailed on rent, but then we find out that he actually

2414
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:51,440
Since the start of the lease

2415
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:53,440
He has not been paying rent

2416
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,800
And uh, you got to take him to court

2417
02:35:57,440 --> 02:36:03,840
Yeah, exactly. And that's that costs money, but he avoids us like he actively just doesn't like want to come in contact with us

2418
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:07,520
Yeah, no shit. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, of course. Yeah

2419
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,720
So the the game plan right now is that like, I mean the landlord says like, oh, you got to pay all that off

2420
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:15,200
um before the lease is up

2421
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:16,880
and um

2422
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:20,720
And it looks like each each roommate here is going to have to pay over like 900

2423
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,760
Um to cover for it, but um, we we got a couple of

2424
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:32,400
You got a you got a you got to hold him responsible for that by any means necessary

2425
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:36,560
No, I I agree. I think um, well, I mean the plan now is to

2426
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:41,760
Cover just cover that the debt we owe and then sue him afterward none

2427
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:49,040
And just just to fucking make sure and then he and then he'll give us the money we spent and plus more hopefully what

2428
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,600
Hold on, uh

2429
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:53,440
How how has it?

2430
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:56,160
I mean, you've been living there. How long you've been living there? Um

2431
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:01,360
Since I think the start of I think the end of june, maybe

2432
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,880
How how have how has how has the landlord

2433
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:09,680
Not said anything. That's another

2434
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:14,080
That's another fucked up thing. That's the landlord told us like hella late

2435
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:17,280
The landlord told us like six months in basically

2436
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
That this has been going on and it's very

2437
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:24,000
It's not good. We don't like I don't I didn't feel like

2438
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:27,520
I don't know that yeah, that does seem fucked up like

2439
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:30,720
I feel like she should

2440
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:33,200
Like how how are you supposed to know?

2441
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:38,800
Like yeah, I I have to like double check our like lease and just see like what's

2442
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:44,880
Distipulations for her not telling us cuz I feel like she should not be able to

2443
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,520
Just be like hey by the way

2444
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:51,120
Yeah, one of you didn't pay rent for six months and the rest of you got to pay it now

2445
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:53,680
Like I don't think she should be able to do that. That doesn't seem legal

2446
02:37:54,400 --> 02:38:00,240
No, no, I mean I I agree. Um, yeah, and uh, we've been talking about that with the other roommates

2447
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:02,160
um

2448
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:05,840
And it's I I don't know I have not taken the time to look at the lease and like

2449
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:10,160
Yeah, I feel like you should be able to like just refuse

2450
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,560
To pay for because that you're not responsible for that there's

2451
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:18,560
Well, it's all there's all of our names on the lease like we all signed it together

2452
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,360
So that's that's the thing we all owe it

2453
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:27,840
I just don't uh, I'm confused how he was able to just not pay rent for six months

2454
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:33,200
Like how like how does that just happen? I'm fucking surprised. I mean maybe like because it seemed like

2455
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:36,880
I don't know this this landlord like

2456
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:39,120
Is lenient

2457
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,760
But like also like this leniency has like

2458
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:48,080
Like she's let like too much terrible shit like slipped by you know negligent is the word. Yeah. Yeah

2459
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:51,440
You're right negligent right because the thing is that we were like

2460
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:54,320
We were like late on rent for a couple of months

2461
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:58,000
And then she and then after like two months she dms. I was like, yo, what's up?

2462
02:38:58,720 --> 02:38:59,840
And um

2463
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,800
And then we tell her like oh, we'll get you we'll pay it all back by the end of like january and we did

2464
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:07,360
Um, I did start that one and go fund me

2465
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:09,920
To like pay like the my late rent

2466
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:12,640
But then around that time is when she told us that like oh this guy

2467
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:17,600
This guy who the thing is this guy disappeared like at the end of like no like in the middle of november

2468
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:20,240
This guy just disappears. We don't see him

2469
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:25,120
For all of december. We don't know what's going on. Well me and my partner don't know what's going on

2470
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,360
um

2471
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:30,240
and then suddenly like um, she tells us this and it's

2472
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:35,520
It's very garbage very garbage that she like waited this long to tell us this is bullshit

2473
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:38,400
and

2474
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:41,680
And apparently this guy just owes a shitload at that at other places too

2475
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,560
Because he apparently can't pay his car

2476
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:47,360
It's just so much

2477
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:49,440
Yeah, it's fucking frustrating

2478
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:54,000
Damn what a what is what a scam though like just move into a new place

2479
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:59,040
Don't pay a rent for six months and then when and then just bail as soon as the landlord's like, hey, uh

2480
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:05,200
What about rent for the last six months? Oh, he's gone already. It's just so genius. It's genius

2481
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:10,800
I was was fucking annoying is that I know for a fact other landlords would like if you're like a couple days late

2482
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,800
The dm you like yeah, what's up?

2483
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:16,000
my my landlord uh when I was

2484
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:20,400
I was uh a little I was I was like three weeks late on rent

2485
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:25,760
And she and and she called me and was like you're late on rent and I was like lull. Sorry

2486
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:30,480
And uh, yeah, well, uh tough tough titties bitch, and then you leave

2487
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:33,280
Basically, yeah

2488
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:36,880
Yeah, three three weeks free three weeks for rent. I'm out. Bye. Yeah

2489
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,600
Uh, oh my god, exactly

2490
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:46,080
Epic. Yeah, I gotta uh, but there's well you're in you're in california, right? So

2491
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:51,120
I don't know. I know the massachusetts is very uh legal legally

2492
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:55,120
Massachusetts gives renters a lot of protections which is pretty based

2493
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:01,840
In massachusetts in massachusetts it is illegal for a landlord to charge

2494
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:06,560
Did I I might have told this already? I won't go into it that long, but

2495
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:11,520
She was she said like hey your rent is rent is late

2496
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:15,360
You got to pay me two hundred and fifty dollars extra because your rent is late

2497
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:23,200
Which is like so that's so that's a totally unreasonable. That's a huge amount of money. That's way more than is is reasonable

2498
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:25,680
um, and it's also

2499
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:29,680
It's just illegal for her to charge me anything late at all

2500
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:36,880
Uh, because in massachusetts, it's specifically not allowed to like find a renter for a late payment

2501
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:41,840
Unless they are more than a month late, and I was not more than a month late. So it was a complete like

2502
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:47,840
Not not only was the number would not hold up in court, but just she's it would it's just can't do that

2503
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:53,360
You just can't do that. Um, and I know that now. Um, so, uh, you know, I don't know

2504
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:56,320
Renting shit renters laws

2505
02:41:56,800 --> 02:42:03,120
It's good to know if you're renting. It's good to know and look into and learn all the laws and shit because uh,

2506
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:07,120
There might be some shit in there that your landlord you can you can kill him

2507
02:42:07,360 --> 02:42:10,880
You'd be like well, mr. Landlord sir, you violated

2508
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:18,320
You violated code 17 146 and now I am the owner of the elder wand actually

2509
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:22,000
And your spells will not affect me sir

2510
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,240
I gotta yeah, this landlord has been kind of doing us some screwy shit

2511
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:29,440
I mean she's led like a lot of shit slide, but then she's also like yeah

2512
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:33,280
Like I remember she my deposit from the previous place

2513
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:37,600
She tried to like give me less and I'm like no no I my deposit was this and I had like

2514
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:40,960
I had like the receipt like on venmo for it and I

2515
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,560
Screenshot and I shut it to her and she stopped arguing with me and she just like

2516
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,280
Sent me the actual amount

2517
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:50,400
I saw you my my um, I had a

2518
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:57,200
Roommate here for a few months. He moved out and then just actually just by coincidence this last weekend

2519
02:42:57,280 --> 02:43:00,160
I ran into him. I ran into him on the the tea

2520
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:05,280
And I'm like, oh, hey, man. What's going on? What's up? And he talked about stuff

2521
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:08,400
We talked about this place and he said

2522
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:12,240
He had told me previously that someone else that lived here told him

2523
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:16,640
Don't even don't even worry about like forget about your your deposit

2524
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:20,000
Like you're never getting it back the landlord won't give it back and this guy

2525
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,800
He said well, you know, I moved out

2526
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,760
Uh, she said he said the landlord gave him half of his deposit back

2527
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:31,120
Because he agreed to like like give the keys

2528
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,200
In a timely fashion

2529
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:35,200
So he should have got the whole thing

2530
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:41,120
But like he because of like some key shit he uh, she he was able to uh

2531
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:46,320
She oh, she gave him half she gave him a half of what he of what he she owed him. So that's great

2532
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:51,520
Is that legal to just give him half of the deposit back yet? Like no, of course not

2533
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:57,920
Of course, I mean she could claim she could claim that there was some reason why she could claim that there was some damage to the room or something

2534
02:43:57,920 --> 02:43:59,920
Which like obviously there wasn't

2535
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:02,080
um, so I'm

2536
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:04,240
My goal

2537
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:06,240
My goal is to I'm gonna try and be

2538
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:09,680
As late on my rent as possible

2539
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:12,640
for for the next

2540
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:17,840
I'm gonna try and be as late on my rent as possible for until the end of my lease and then

2541
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:21,520
I'm gonna not pay my last month's rent

2542
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:27,520
This is my plan and then I'm gonna until you know, maybe maybe three months later. I'll pay it

2543
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:30,400
Or maybe three weeks like three weeks later

2544
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,760
um, and uh, I just I'll just I'll just like not pay the last one

2545
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:40,960
And then my my and then if she asks me like hey, where's last month's rent?

2546
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,680
I'll tell you like well, you have my security deposit, you know taking that

2547
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,360
That's pretty good

2548
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:49,760
I think it might work. I think there's a chance it might work

2549
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:51,520
um

2550
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:56,160
So, yeah, that's my that's my plan to try and not let her screw me

2551
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:01,760
On my deposit because I know because I know she wants to I know this lady's fucking evil

2552
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:03,840
Jesus Christ

2553
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:10,240
Yeah, so I gotta I like your situation sounds pretty fucked up though. Yeah, I gotta I gotta look up

2554
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,720
I need to look up like what are the

2555
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:16,320
Our landlords really supposed to tell us if someone else is late on the rent

2556
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:24,160
That something is not something is not kosher about that situation right exactly because like if that's the case

2557
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:27,520
Like oh, yeah that landlord has to tell you right away when someone's like late on the rent

2558
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:30,640
Then it's kind of like okay. Well, she hasn't told us in like six months

2559
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:37,760
Right, so yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem so if we can like if we can like use that against her

2560
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:42,400
Also, this place was like a kind of a shithole before we moved in and luckily one of our roommates

2561
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:47,840
Recorded everything that was like bad like everything that was bad in the place before they all moved in

2562
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:50,560
So we all have that

2563
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,760
um

2564
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,760
It's just it's just annoying

2565
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:57,120
And I think I've been too much on the sideline in this whole situation

2566
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,920
I've mostly been letting my partner and other roommates kind of handle this

2567
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:05,520
And maybe uh, maybe it's time to man up. I mean it's time to grow a pair and take my t-shots

2568
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:08,320
Wow

2569
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:10,320
Cheesy Manfredo, uh

2570
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:13,040

Um, oh, it's comparison of things

2585
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:58,560
Oh, it's uh, it's one piece versus uh

2586
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:02,480
Uh rank and bass rank and bass, uh, yeah

2587
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:05,360
Like stop motion

2588
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:06,880

02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:23,120
They disney totally ripped off the ideal for their whale movie off of hiyao Miyazaki's

2593
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:26,320
A famous whale manga from the 80s

2594
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,400
Uh

2595
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:32,000
Next yeah next voicemail is called

2596
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:35,840

2597
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:38,720
Three two one go

2598
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:44,240
Also, anybody knows of any connections between the ranking best movies and one piece that I didn't call

Oh, these are monsters just like in a thriller bark. I'm like, yeah, but that's like

Marmite is that marmite is that australian stuff right no no that's vegemite

Marmite is the english one

02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:22,960
But it's okay, but it's similar though

2636
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:28,080
I can't confirm, but I've heard it similar. It's like it's like a it's like a brown or deny

2637
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,960
It's like a brown like kind of tangy like fermented paste

2638
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:34,320

You got to do it candid you got to have like you got to have a

A secret journalist paparazzi

2653
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,200
Candid photo is the only way you'll get that

02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:44,800
Right exactly like if it's so precious then that means it should be worth your precious dollars that you have in your pockets right now

2658
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:51,120
Yeah, don't don't beg put the put your money where your mouth is put your money where her mouth is

Oh

2676
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:00,960

Ben uh ben saint talking about his never changing fear of getting his head smashed by a train truly is light life chaining

2679
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:20,800
I think they meant to say life changing

2680
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:22,800
Thank you

2681
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:24,800
He's life chained

2682
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:30,960
Is is this youtube like asking people is it bringing back the five star rating to get like an accurate

2683
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:32,720
Is this good?

2684
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:37,680
Yeah, I think so. I've been seeing people say that youtube has been asking them has been

2685
02:53:38,400 --> 02:53:40,400
Making them answer questions lately

2686
02:53:40,800 --> 02:53:45,680
That's so weird. Yeah, I don't know. I suppose I suppose the whole like publicly

2687
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:47,680
viewable

2688
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:53,520
Rating system does encourage people to like performatively make the number go big or small

2689
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:55,920
Depending on like the community

2690
02:53:56,480 --> 02:53:58,480
Does youtube rather than their actual

2691
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:02,000
Interests like does youtube want the number to go big? Do they care?

2692
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:04,720
If like people rate videos well

2693
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:07,840
I I don't know probably just so like did you like it?

2694
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:13,600
Hmm, would you recommend youtube would you recommend youtube to friends and family?

2695
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:16,960
No, but the thing is like people will always joke

2696
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:22,400
Like this and then like people who are typing in heartwarming video will get the pcp

2697
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:26,960

2702
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:51,760
Multiple songs on spotify with over a million plays or something

2703

It was the bail jpeh song. I was the halloween special song

2707
02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:13,360
I have clout and I have a history with the show. I'm the perfect guest and

2708
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:18,480
We can reminisce on old times like that remember when you guys were like

2709
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:24,000
Hey, jesse your video is a yellow and jesse was like, no, they're not yellow

2710
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:28,640
But they were totally yellow, but they were totally yellow. So like, you know

2711
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:33,520
I don't know how to get on the podcast, but this is I want can I

2712
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:36,320
Yeah

2713
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:43,040
Yeah, I remember hearing about like maybe like no, thank you was like a commenter that I'd seen before and then

2714
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:48,560
Like not too long ago. I'd learned they were only evolved with 100 geck's which is pretty cool

2715
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:53,200
That's kind of wild. I I recognize the screen name

2716
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:57,680
I didn't know they uh, I didn't know they were racist far

2717
02:55:58,480 --> 02:56:00,480
Okay, yeah, maybe yeah

2718
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:05,440
Not that jesse ain't here. You can't defend himself when we totally say that video was yellow

2719
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:11,440
You fucking idiot. Check your eyes. I mean we said it then too. We said it was fucking yellow because it was fucking yellow

2720
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,480
Obviously any idiot could see that it was yellow

2721
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:16,480
um

2722
02:56:16,480 --> 02:56:18,480
Yeah, yeah

2723
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:19,840
I'll

2724
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:21,840
I said it that and I'll say it again

2725
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:28,400
Uh, that's neat. Uh, yeah, okay. Maybe we can get no. Thank you in the in the fucking

2726
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:31,360
guest discord. I guess

2727
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:34,000
Probably, uh, I'm on the spot. Uh

2728
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,720
Why what you're on the spot about?

2729
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:39,840
I mean, I don't know. I don't I guess I don't know too much about them

2730
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:42,320
But like uh, why not?

2731
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:45,120
Yeah, sure. Okay

2732
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:49,600
Now now I hope now we're gonna have a flood now

2733
02:56:49,600 --> 02:56:54,560
It's gonna be thousands and thousands of thousands of people who are involved with 100 geck's saying oh, I have a plot too

2734
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:57,200
Yeah, yeah, all right

2735
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:01,600
Okay, next whatever next next voicemail is called, uh

2736
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:06,480
No, here it is long huang long huang dong

2737
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:09,280
three two one go

2738
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:17,680
Long chun is obviously just a bad riff on samurai sama. Yes, except where samurai sama. It's an actual character

2739
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:20,320
Long chun is just a bad stereotype

2740
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:25,040
Yeah, and being half chinese have bitten me. This partially offends me

2741
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:30,080
Like that's not even a chinese accent. All your chinese half is offended

2742
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:36,240
I say throw the fucker in voice jail. I would oh and also throw the on an iranic crypto bro there too

2743
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:39,520
Yeah, bye

2744
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:43,040
I think there is a voicemail. Well, uh, um

2745
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:47,600
What was wang wang chang? What's his name?

2746
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:53,680
Something he's got a voicemail coming up and last week he said big big things next week

2747
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:57,440
So let's let's see what is let's see what his final his final plea

2748
02:57:58,080 --> 02:58:02,880
For his life and his freedom is before we before we put him in the slammer. All right

2749
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:07,600
He's he's on trial this week. Yeah, so he better impress us

2750
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:09,840
Next

2751
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:13,760
Oh, yeah, uh next one is uh a youtube video

2752
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:17,280
Yeah, and it is a link to okay. I watched this

2753
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:23,120
Okay, i'm actually glad this person sent this video in this is a guy

2754
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:29,120
CJ makes videos he made or he is making a uh

2755
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:32,340
Like a retrospective series

2756
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:35,600
About uh the pcp

2757
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:38,560
Ha and this is his

2758
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:40,640
first

2759
02:58:40,640 --> 02:58:44,080
Video about it. I think I think has he made any more since then?

2760
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:46,800
No, he made this video three weeks ago

2761
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:49,680
um

2762
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:51,680
Okay, and

2763
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:59,200
It's really funny. This is the story of this is the first bit it talks about like basically the the formation of the horse cast

2764
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:00,800
but

2765
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:08,640
Hilariously and and I appreciate it. It's does not start with digi. It starts with tbap. It's it's like, uh,

2766
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:15,440
This guy basically, uh, he he diagnoses it as like tbap is the like, uh,

2767
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:19,200
The central point around which the horse cast

2768
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:20,880
uh

2769
02:59:20,880 --> 02:59:22,480
formed

2770
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:25,520
And uh, I think it's I don't know. I just thought that was interesting

2771
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:29,680
I'm not sure if I wonder what their argument is about that because it well, I

2772
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:31,840
Yeah

2773
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:33,840
It was definitely like it very initially

2774
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:36,480
A jesse digi thing

2775
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:38,480
And then I was in there

2776
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:44,960
I guess maybe maybe if you want to say like, okay, but that wasn't it wasn't really like the pcp until

2777
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:49,680
Kagan phantom. I don't know. Yeah, you two definitely had like a

2778
02:59:50,640 --> 02:59:55,200
A good mix with the rest of us to make her like a group dynamic that was fun

2779
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:59,600
Yeah, I remember some of the earlier horse cast was extremely awkward

2780
03:00:00,480 --> 03:00:02,480
Where it was just me and the other two

2781
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:06,640
This guy it's funny. This guy doesn't even like mention digi brony

2782
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:14,480
Like he mentions digi brony as sort of a like, oh, yeah, and then one time, uh, tbap mentioned this other guy digi brony

2783
03:00:14,480 --> 03:00:16,480
And that kind of started a whole thing

2784
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:20,080
Uh, I feel like if I were, uh, to

2785
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:25,440
He does not mention to me to me the moments that kick started like hey

2786
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:34,960
Maybe we should all be friends and make a podcast was, uh, when he doesn't mention when you made the the weekly roundup videos and you included, uh

2787
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:39,040
You know, you would have include our videos in your in

2788
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:42,240
Right. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

2789
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:45,680
He doesn't mention those

2790
03:00:46,240 --> 03:00:52,000
Yeah, anyway, uh, this was a pretty good analysis assemblage. I came up with a yes

2791
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,040
analysis assemblage, uh

2792
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:00,400
Anyway, I like this video and I recommend people to watch it and I hope

2793
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:06,880
It's good. And I hope uh, I hope he makes I hope he keeps going with it. Uh, I like it

2794
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:08,800
um

2795
03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:13,200
Next voicemail is called. Uh, sorry. Where did or did they put it?

2796
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:15,920
Um

2797
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:19,200
No, I gotta go to

2798
03:01:20,320 --> 03:01:22,320
Oh, it's from son of marowak

2799
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:25,040
posting it in the chat right

2800
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:26,160
there

2801
03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:28,320
Okay, three two one go

2802
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:37,520
So I've recently been reacquainted with twilight sparkles secret ship Vic folder and I've really been itching to make

2803
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:46,400
Horseshoe crew style cards. I have ideas for goals ship cards and pony cards inspired off of the horseshoe crew

2804
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:48,160
and

2805
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:52,400
probably just general pcp lore talking about the horseshoe crew a lot today

2806
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:55,520
I would make a digi bro card a princess

2807
03:01:56,240 --> 03:01:58,240
Unicorn well, it should be digi brony

2808
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:00,720
and

2809
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:03,440
I would have funny effects like

2810
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,120
Uh, the meme that tom will never die

2811
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:14,160
He could be a card that you can like take from the discard pile and put back on put back into the game whenever you want

2812
03:02:14,480 --> 03:02:17,440
Uh, I would uh, there would be goal cards like

2813
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:20,800
For instance, it could be called rad con

2814
03:02:21,760 --> 03:02:23,760
And the goal of that

2815
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:27,280
A card would get all the crew together ship

2816
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:34,640
Uh, at least six like the lens of exodia horseshoe crew keywords so to speak and you get that goal

2817
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:38,560
Uh, if you guys don't know the game like the ins and outs

2818
03:02:39,360 --> 03:02:41,360
I think it's a really fun game

2819
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:43,840
If I know you've heard about it because you've talked about it

2820
03:02:44,720 --> 03:02:45,600
but

2821
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:50,640
I'm really itching to make a expansion deck and if you guys

2822
03:02:51,280 --> 03:02:53,280
Would like to lend me your

2823
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:56,640
Your voice and your opinions. Let me know

2824
03:02:57,520 --> 03:02:59,520
Yeah, I uh

2825
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:04,160
I've never played the game. I'm I'm vaguely familiar with it. I'm I've seen it played

2826
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:08,400
I understand sort of how it works. I've never played it. I don't really know

2827
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:10,880
I I always assumed it was like

2828
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:18,240
A pony version of cars against humanity. I'd never really looked into it at all. No, it's it's not like that exactly

2829
03:03:18,720 --> 03:03:20,720
I know you have to

2830
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:23,360
You sort of build

2831
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:25,360
Like a sort of like grid

2832
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:29,040
You sort you sort of build like out in like chains

2833
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:35,440
You chain like chain cards together through like shipping them together or something and you you're building towards some sort of like

2834
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,040
goal

2835
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:40,560
With it and I don't know that's probably uh wrong

2836
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:43,440
But it's it's something like that

2837
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:50,000
Uh, yeah, I don't really know how it's played. I know chris chan makes uh or was used to make uh, uh

2838
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:56,560
Like she made uh, she made the slime city, uh new new los angeles city uh expansion deck

2839
03:03:57,280 --> 03:03:59,280
Which would be a funny thing to play with

2840
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:01,680
um

2841
03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:07,120
Yeah, you could i'm sure you could make uh, you could make uh stuff out of lots of pcp memes

2842
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:14,640
Uh, uh, yeah, you could definitely do it. Uh, I don't know if I have any like specific ideas off the top of my head

2843
03:04:15,360 --> 03:04:16,640
Uh

2844
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:18,640
milking uh former members

2845
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:20,640
for

2846
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:23,440
For this new this new content. It's just all

2847
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:26,640
uh, uh

2848
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:33,600
If you make it about make it about the horseshoe crew and then we don't have to worry about the fact that nobody in the pcp is still here

2849
03:04:34,160 --> 03:04:36,160
Uh

2850
03:04:36,560 --> 03:04:39,760
Because the p the horseshoe crew is preserved in amber in the past

2851
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:42,560
Along with everything else

2852
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:49,440
Uh, next voicemail is called mario movie three two one go

2853
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:53,280
I had this dream where I saw the mario movie

2854
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:57,440
And instead it was a loop on the third movie or loop on the gang

2855
03:04:58,080 --> 03:04:59,440
brain, uh

2856
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:03,120
Fucking made a movie set for chris batten all those other losers in the movie

2857
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:08,800
And it was like that one episode where they took the old nazi and make them think he's in a world war two

2858
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:11,120
In world war two in a movie set

2859
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:13,680
But it's like kind of like that

2860
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:14,560
Fucked up

2861
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:16,560
So like the the real

2862
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:19,440
Like a roger rabbit situation where everyone's loop on the third

2863
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:24,480
But there's a live action chris pratt and they're they're trying to film him being mario

2864
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:31,840
It's it's okay. No, it's a cartoon loop on the third they're cartoons

2865
03:05:32,720 --> 03:05:34,720
And live action chris pratt

2866
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:38,720

2904
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:20,480
I was making sure the full picture was being understood

2905
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:24,960
Anyway come see our minecraft server cuz it's fucking good

2906

So so we have we have no that was great. That was great. I can't believe he wrote a whole song for it

2908
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:40,960
All right, first of all, yeah, it's been a really long time. So we look at the minecraft server

2909
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:45,920
We should look at the minecraft server. We should definitely do that. Yeah, we should definitely do that

2910
03:08:47,280 --> 03:08:48,480
Definitely do that

2912
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:51,200

2915
03:08:58,080 --> 03:09:01,040
Uh, second of all, I did not misrepresent your intentions

2916
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:05,440
Meron Meron Meron sent me a dm about this before and I said, uh

2917
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:11,520
He said he said that I was I was narcing. He was like, hey, I didn't I wasn't narcing and I was like

2918
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:16,960
I didn't think you were narcing. I understand that you just wanted to inform me. That's what I said

2919
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:22,800
I said you want you you messaged me. I don't know. I just I don't think I misrepresented whatever

2920
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:25,040

2922
03:09:27,360 --> 03:09:32,400
Uh, okay. Good song though. I can't believe you wrote that whole stupid thing for the stupid

2923
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:35,280
voicemail

2924
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:41,440
Yeah, okay, uh, I'll be right back. Yeah, okay continue with the voice. Okay. Okay. We're we're moving right along here

2925
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:45,520
Uh, the next the next voicemail is a Japanese

2926
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:52,080
It's it's title is in Japanese and google translate tells me that this means defecation

2927
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:56,320
Uh in japanese, so uh, that's pretty cool

2928
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:01,840
Um, anyway, uh three two one go

2929
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:09,840
The pro krastinators podcast why this name who came up with it and what is a krastinator? Come on

2930
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:13,280
That's that's like the top of the iceberg

2931
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:15,920
Come on come on

2932
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:17,920
bro

2933
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:24,960
Come on. All right next uh next who came up with it. Uh, I don't even know I don't remember was it nate

2934
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:30,960
I think mage may have come up with it, but I'm not sure. Yeah

2935
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:37,520
Yeah, somebody said it and everyone was like ha ha that's really funny because we don't work

2936
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:41,840
Sometimes it wasn't it wasn't me for sure

2937
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:46,880
I don't actually don't remember who I think actually it must have been because

2938
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:49,680
It must have been mage must have been who mage

2939
03:10:50,240 --> 03:10:52,000
I think so. Why do you say that?

2940
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:57,520
Because it was sort of a disparaging remark and I remember her being involved in the naming of the group somehow

2941
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:03,680
Obviously the podcast is just named after the group and that came first. It's like what should we call ourselves?

2942
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:05,680
We're not the horseshoe crew anymore

2943
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:08,720
Actually it was a disparaging remark, you know

2944
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:13,760
It was like ha ha like we're pro crest and aiding all the time

2945
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:20,160
But I actually can't remember if it was major or not. I know mage had the discord server or something

2946
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:23,680
The the skype group mage started the skype group

2947
03:11:24,320 --> 03:11:27,520
She yes, okay. Well, I don't know

2948
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:34,640
And then she and then she also I mean then she also started the discord server when we decided to migrate to discord

2949
03:11:35,440 --> 03:11:36,720
um

2950
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:38,880
Yeah, okay, uh, something like that

2951
03:11:39,520 --> 03:11:46,800
Um, I don't remember next one is a question. Ben. Have you played delta ruin chapter two yet? Uh, shamefully no

2952
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:52,880
You shamefully I I was gonna I was gonna do it on stream and then I just never did it do it off stream

2953
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:55,520
Yeah

2954
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:58,480
Maybe that's what a gamer would say

2955
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:02,640
I just don't want to do it. I don't want to do anything until slime and punishment is done

2956
03:12:02,800 --> 03:12:06,640
I can't justify anything. Well, that's fair. So maybe after that maybe

2957
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:08,240
Uh

2958
03:12:08,240 --> 03:12:13,600
Next one is will jeff ever get cancelled for being on this podcast. Uh, I'm gonna say probably not

2959
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,640
Who cares? No. Yeah

2960
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:18,000
uh

2961
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
Next one is uh

2962
03:12:20,240 --> 03:12:23,360
Message for crack on the episode 300

2963
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
opening

2964
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:32,560
Here posting a message for crack on the 300 episode opening three two one go

2965
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:39,120
Hey crack. Um, first I want to say, uh, fuck you and second of all I want to say no

2966
03:12:39,120 --> 03:12:43,360
I genuinely want that to be opening for every episode. So, uh, yeah, you're wrong

2967
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:50,320
And uh, fuck you again. Okay. Uh, well, yeah. Oh, I see crack assumed something

2968
03:12:50,640 --> 03:12:57,520
He I I did watch the last episode. Yeah, this this guy said make the opening for the 300 the opening for every episode

2969
03:12:57,840 --> 03:13:01,440
Crack said I think what this guy actually means is just that he likes

2970
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,000
The episode that opening

2971
03:13:04,240 --> 03:13:06,640
But not that he would not that it would actually make a good

2972
03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:11,840
Opening for every episode, which I also don't think it would make a good opening for every episode

2973
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:14,880
But apparently this guy's serious. Okay, that's fine

2974
03:13:15,920 --> 03:13:17,120
You know

2975
03:13:17,120 --> 03:13:19,120

Wang chan very sorry

2984
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
In the meantime, how are you?

2985
03:13:44,480 --> 03:13:46,480
Okay, well next time

2986
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:48,640
So so it's not even your big thing

2987
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:50,720
Uh voice jail

2988
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,200
Took too long voice. Yeah. No, I

2989
03:13:54,400 --> 03:13:59,840
He's got something. He's cooking up something. It's bad. Yeah, you're you should he's just a

2990
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:04,640
He's got nothing to it. He's gotten I don't I don't believe he's got anything coming

2991
03:14:05,360 --> 03:14:07,360
It's probably gonna be bad. Yeah

2992
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:10,400
It's probably gonna it's not gonna be good

2993
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:14,880
It's not gonna be good, but I'm more I guess I'm curious. I don't know like maybe it's something

2994
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:20,560
Well, if it if it appears you can still play it. I guess okay. It's definitely in jail right now

2995
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:22,960
You know what? All right. I'll agree to that. I'll agree to that

2996
03:14:22,960 --> 03:14:31,440
We can get him out on uh on um parole for uh for a for a new hearing. Oh, this is this is like a

2997
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:36,880
It's changed up from it's changed everything. He was going he was going somewhere with it the whole time

2998
03:14:36,960 --> 03:14:39,440
It was an ironic commentary on um

2999
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:43,600
Anyway, next voicemail

3000
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:49,920
It's uh next voicemail is a youtube link. Uh, let me post it here for you

3001
03:14:50,800 --> 03:14:52,800
All right

3002
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:58,320
Yes, it's a link to the new uh the new void gazers podcast

3003
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:04,560
That oh, oh, I I love this thumbnail. What's going on? I love this

3004
03:15:05,280 --> 03:15:07,280
This thumbnail is like fucking

3005
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,240
The new adventures of batman thumbnail. Yeah

3006
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:14,000
Uh, it's uh, you know, whatever

3007
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:17,360
So I saw

3008
03:15:17,360 --> 03:15:23,200
I saw someone asking in a in a comment. No, there's one there's one comment on this video. That's really funny

3009
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:26,400
It's a guy says uh great episode

3010
03:15:27,200 --> 03:15:31,200
Too bad no one's gonna see it because of this channel's limited reach

3011
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:32,880
Uh

3012
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:37,280
Boy, this is actually riley. I thought it was like a joke. No like channel

3013
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:43,600
No, this is actually riley. What's happening? I thought riley left. I'm not up to speed with

3014
03:15:44,160 --> 03:15:47,360
Oh, okay. No riley, um

3015
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:54,560
I mean who we can only speculate as to why but uh riley quit yig

3016
03:15:55,440 --> 03:15:57,440
And he cancelled void gazers

3017
03:15:58,320 --> 03:16:00,320
but he

3018
03:16:00,560 --> 03:16:03,600
But I guess he I think he just didn't want to edit it anymore

3019
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:05,680
I think it probably was like

3020
03:16:05,680 --> 03:16:09,520
It's just not worth it and like I guess I who can blame him

3021
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:15,600
Uh, so they're not doing so he cancelled void gazers, but then they started the new void gazers podcast

3022
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:18,960
Which is like, I don't know, you know

3023
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:25,520
Because they're not going to be traveling anymore, right? They're not going to like be doing road trips and seeing each other because that's expensive

3024
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:31,680
Uh, so instead of doing that riley, trixie, mint and birds. It's just the same people

3025
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:34,480
Yes, it's just the same it's just the same people

3026
03:16:34,720 --> 03:16:40,160
But only but it's only instead of seeing each other in person. They're just uh, I don't know

3027
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:42,640
talking about how

3028
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:45,920
much how revolutionary the donda stem player is

3029
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:48,880
uh, yeah

3030
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:50,480
so, uh

3031
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:55,680
What else what else do I have to say about this? Um, did you watch this whole podcast episode?

3032
03:16:55,840 --> 03:16:57,760
No, some people in the discord in my discord

3033
03:16:57,760 --> 03:17:02,640
We were talking about it and I know riley is like really into the donda stem player for some reason

3034
03:17:05,440 --> 03:17:12,000
Uh, uh, he's trying to he's trying to get sucked up. He's sucking up to cotton. Yeah, he's trying to he's trying to get

3035
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:14,080
He's trying to get that in with the a

3036
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:16,000
right

3037
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,800
What else what else is there to say about this? Um, I feel like there was maybe

3038
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:21,120
um

3039
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:23,600
I don't know nothing everything everything

3040
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:28,560
Everything everything trixie tried to do with her channel was eventually

3041
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:33,840
Fail a failure and just had to be had to be shunted off to some side channel never to be seen again

3042
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:36,480
Void gaze is just no different. LeMau

3043
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:39,040
Damn

3044
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:43,600
She should go back to her anime podcast. She should go back to her anime podcast. Um

3045
03:17:44,640 --> 03:17:49,520
Anime videos are also not doing well. They're barely they're not even the new one got like 3000 views

3046
03:17:50,480 --> 03:17:52,480
LeMau

3047
03:17:52,480 --> 03:17:54,480
She should copy hazel again

3048
03:17:54,880 --> 03:17:59,680
Uh, I think she tried I think the new one is another attempt to be do copy hazel

3049
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:02,640
But it didn't work

3050
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:04,000
Yeah

3051
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,480
Oh god, the next one is also called, uh

3052
03:18:07,280 --> 03:18:09,280
Void gazers lives on

3053
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:10,880
All right

3054
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:13,600
Three two void gazers three two one go

3055
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:16,480
It's not dead. It's not dead

3056
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:18,880
whoo

3057
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:24,800
Hell void it should be they should have renamed the podcast the void gazers right on

3058
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:27,680
Then it'd be ironic because they don't travel no more. Yeah

3059
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:32,480
Uh, the void gazers, uh live live from detroit

3060
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:34,880
It's

3061
03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:40,000
Okay, next force mail is called, uh, vacation time, baby three two one go

3062
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:42,160
Hello comrades

3063
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:44,960
Nikolai would like to apologize for waiting Ukraine

3064
03:18:45,520 --> 03:18:53,600
Nikolai would stop Nikolai on vacation right now drinking vodka. Yeah, not I know you I know you would never

3065
03:18:53,680 --> 03:18:57,840
I know you would never do such a thing. Nikola. Oh, is it is it is it unfair?

3066
03:18:57,920 --> 03:19:04,720
Is it unfair for us to uh, it's for us to, uh, hate Wong Chung, but uh, we're cool with Nikolai's, uh

3067
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:09,120
shitty russian impression. Are we being are we every double standard?

3068
03:19:09,360 --> 03:19:14,320
I think it's mostly because russian isn't like a race. It's fine because in my head, um

3069
03:19:15,280 --> 03:19:18,080
In my head, I imagine that he's white passing. So it's okay

3070
03:19:18,880 --> 03:19:20,640
I think russians are white

3071
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:23,280
They named a whole drink after it. Aren't they asian?

3072
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:26,800
They're the same continent as asia, right

3073
03:19:26,960 --> 03:19:32,000
But they're you're right. Because they're such a white asian. What?

3074
03:19:32,480 --> 03:19:34,480
um, um

3075
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:37,840
Yeah, we didn't even oh, yeah, we didn't even talk about uh

3076
03:19:38,720 --> 03:19:43,920
Uh, Ukraine this week. I don't think we have to I don't yeah, I don't really have any uh,

3077
03:19:44,160 --> 03:19:46,560
Trenching insights about it war war is bad

3078
03:19:47,680 --> 03:19:49,680
War war never changes

3079
03:19:49,920 --> 03:19:51,760
yeah

3080
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:53,680
it's uh

3081
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,360
Yeah, I

3082
03:19:55,360 --> 03:20:01,200
A lot of better people better equipped to talk about the situation I'm talking about yeah, and a lot of and a lot of

3083
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:03,200
Worse equipped people too

3084
03:20:03,200 --> 03:20:08,000
Oh, yeah, especially I guess they see that one guy. Did you see that one guy who was encouraging?

3085
03:20:08,640 --> 03:20:13,120
Uh, uh, ukrainian civilians to throw paint balloons at russian tanks

3086
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:15,840
Yeah, that was

3087
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:19,200
No, I didn't see I mean that's it

3088
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:25,120
What would have that done? Well, he was saying that like you can disable their cameras by hitting them with a paint balloon

3089
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:28,160
Oh, see see oh, yeah

3090
03:20:28,720 --> 03:20:34,960
So yeah, yeah, so just just just go close to it go close to the invading army with their tanks and their infantry

3091
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:38,320
And uh, real home throw paintball a long time. Shit

3092
03:20:39,360 --> 03:20:45,760
Real home. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we must uh, we must adopt the strategies of makaulik hulkin and home alone to repel

3093
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:50,000
Yeah, you get a bunch of fucking grease on the road like oh

3094
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:55,680
It drops where it was a couple of marbles on the ground and put in walks by and trips on them

3095
03:20:55,680 --> 03:20:58,960
Like oh, he flings up in the air before he lands on the ground

3096
03:20:59,360 --> 03:21:07,840
Uh, if only if only an frank had just hung a paint can from a string on the staircase leading up to the attic

3097
03:21:08,400 --> 03:21:12,000
Uh, that would have repelled the the invader

3098
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:18,960
Uh, the nazis coming in right right and and I think ukraine can learn a thing or two as well

3099
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:20,880
um

3100
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:22,880
Yeah, so uh

3101
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:24,480
ukraine

3102
03:21:24,480 --> 03:21:26,000
War is bad

3103
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:30,000
Maybe maybe I'll explain it to the to the people in a way. They'll understand you see

3104
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:32,480
Putin is emperor palpatine

3105
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:35,040
And uh, russia is the empire

3106
03:21:35,280 --> 03:21:38,400
He he kind of is he kind of is like an insane

3107
03:21:39,120 --> 03:21:44,000
He is this crazy old fuck right now to get the fuck out. I mean, I guess he always was

3108
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:45,760
um

3109
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:49,280
You see ukraine are the rebels they're much like harry potter. You see and

3110
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:53,840
Oh god, you uh ukraine is like

3111
03:21:54,720 --> 03:22:01,840
Uh, oh wait, you victor crates from in the in the in the uh, try no in the uh in the quidditch

3112
03:22:02,480 --> 03:22:05,920
I was gonna say the quidditch the quidditch world cup was the was what I was looking for

3113
03:22:06,160 --> 03:22:08,160
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

3114
03:22:08,240 --> 03:22:14,160
Ukraine is a kim kardashian while russia's kanya. Have you seen the

3115
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:16,000
the

3116
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:22,560
Have you seen the the president of ukraine is just hanging out on the streets in Kiev while it's I've seen people

3117
03:22:23,280 --> 03:22:28,560
Like he's he's like vlogging from there like yeah, fuck really. I ain't going anywhere. Wow. Yeah

3118
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:32,320
Like a big hard ass. It's just like it's just like out in broad daylight

3119
03:22:32,320 --> 03:22:40,000
Then there's like that's awesome to be like expected to happen. He's like we will not stand down to you bullies you motherfuckers

3120
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:46,720
We're cool. That's like coming. You know, that's pretty cool. He's probably he's gonna die if you know, I hadn't seen that

3121
03:22:47,120 --> 03:22:55,600
I have seen people uh being pretty uh positive on zolensky. I have seen people talking about how he's a comedian turn president

3122
03:22:56,560 --> 03:23:02,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've heard that. It's pretty funny. So he's got he's got a he's got a I guess a neck for dramatic

3123
03:23:02,480 --> 03:23:09,120
That's very funny. What he's doing is is yeah, wait a second and it's really good for morale apparently because like

3124
03:23:09,840 --> 03:23:15,760
A lot of the russians who are being sent in are like teenagers who are forced to go and they were like tricked into

3125
03:23:16,640 --> 03:23:18,640
Like going yeah, I've seen

3126
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:21,760
And they didn't even realize they were supposed to be killing people and they surrendered

3127
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:26,960
It doesn't really yeah from what I've been seeing like a lot of russians don't like the war either

3128
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:33,680
It's it's just like a which is good. Um, wait a second is it's it's really just a putin

3129
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:37,280
That's what I'm sick. Yeah, like insanity thing and it's really

3130
03:23:38,240 --> 03:23:40,240
That he's has that power still

3131
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:42,720
did wait a second in zolensky the

3132
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:47,840
Wait, the ukrainian president the ukrainian president cranium wasn't he

3133
03:23:48,800 --> 03:23:51,920
Wasn't he the president who was who before became president?

3134
03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:56,400
He was in a comedic series about a comedian who becomes president and then when the series was over

3135
03:23:56,400 --> 03:23:59,040
He actually ran for president and won. Is that true?

3136
03:23:59,840 --> 03:24:05,280
I'm trying to look it up. I remember that I heard that like a year back or so. I'm like uh, phil the franco

3137
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:10,080
I mean that would be that would be really funny. Okay. Yeah, so let's keep in 2015

3138
03:24:10,240 --> 03:24:15,520
Zolensky played the star of the television series servant of the people where he played the role of president of ukraine

3139
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:17,760
You

3140
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:24,640
The ukrainian president used to be a comedian and he's fucking he's like a mean

3141
03:24:24,720 --> 03:24:29,120
He's unironically more of a mean president than donald trump and he's like out there on the streets

3142
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:31,440
Like with the fucking troops and everything. Holy shit

3143
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:33,200
Amazing

3144
03:24:33,200 --> 03:24:38,800
He's what a basement. Yeah base. Um, he might he might suck. He might suck in other ways

3145
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:42,240
He might but like I mean if you're getting invaded

3146
03:24:42,800 --> 03:24:49,120
Be like being being like showing solidarity with your people as they're being invaded is pretty cool

3147
03:24:49,520 --> 03:24:54,080
No, don't get me. Don't get me wrong. I hate your policies. Maybe I hate all hierarchies

3148
03:24:54,560 --> 03:25:01,200
You know, like a good little like a good little anarcho boy. I am but um, even even even an archo cheesy could say, uh,

3149
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:08,080
Based I love presidents. I love I love liberal democracy. I love the free market

3152
03:25:18,080 --> 03:25:23,840
Uh, he he loved uh, i'm trying to think what's the end of the end of 1984 is like he love he loved nato

3153
03:25:25,520 --> 03:25:27,520
Winston Winston loved nato

3154
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:29,120
uh

3155
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:32,960
Okay, next voicemail is uh from overwatch

3156
03:25:33,760 --> 03:25:37,680
1984 is a good book. I like it. You know, you know, I think um

3157
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:44,080
Damn, I don't know. I I'm gonna I'm gonna start. I want to start reading books. Uh, I should read books

3158
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:50,320
Uh, I think I might go to the library. Maybe after maybe after phantom's revenge. I might go to the library and just pick up

3159
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:53,520
Some books I never read before and read them

3160
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:58,320
I don't know what to read. Wow. Make sure you take a selfie while you're down. So people

3161
03:25:59,280 --> 03:26:02,000
Books are for suckers bad read more comics

3162
03:26:02,880 --> 03:26:04,080
Here's the thing

3163
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:08,320
Books books are for suckers, but I feel like I don't know. I think I

3164
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:10,800
I think I want

3165
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:16,640
To maybe start like writing stuff and I think that starting to read stuff might be a good

3166
03:26:17,920 --> 03:26:21,440
First step, you know what I mean? Okay, I got you. Yeah, I got you

3167
03:26:22,240 --> 03:26:27,760
Okay, but if you read enough comics, eventually you would have read the same amount of a regular book and that way

3168
03:26:28,480 --> 03:26:33,600
Uh, comics are for babies comics are for little babies that need pictures. I'm

3169
03:26:34,480 --> 03:26:37,360
Want to be in the realms of pure ideas pure thought

3170
03:26:38,080 --> 03:26:40,560
Damn Ben read read more dead clouds. That's

3171
03:26:41,280 --> 03:26:46,320
That's that will feel that'll stimulate you. I did stimulate your underside your your brain will tickle your brain

3172
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:50,400
I did really like uh, fuck. What was the name of the one you gave me? Uh

3173
03:26:51,360 --> 03:26:53,360
It's david boring. Yeah

3174
03:26:54,240 --> 03:26:58,160
Yeah, david boring. I did I did like david boring a lot read. Um, you should read a

3175
03:26:59,200 --> 03:27:05,680
You should read a defray next because that's kind of like david boring, but there's like a superhero angle to it

3176
03:27:06,640 --> 03:27:09,680
I should I should read some more. Yeah, that's that's fair

3177
03:27:10,400 --> 03:27:16,400
All right, that'll stimulate your other side right there, buddy. Let's let's do the next one the next one wait

3178
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:19,120
I post I posted the wrong one here. This is

3179
03:27:21,280 --> 03:27:23,280
What wait, um

3180
03:27:23,840 --> 03:27:29,120
No, no, I didn't the next one is called local print shop quote quandary 3 2 1 go

3181
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:37,280
Hey last episode ben mentioned that his local print shop wouldn't give him the formula to determine prices and he had to

3182
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:41,840
Bespokely ask them for every permutation. He was interested in yeah

3183
03:27:41,840 --> 03:27:46,880
And I wanted to mention that this is not just your local print shop. My local print shop is the same way

3184
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:50,320
I expect it's uh every local print shop in america

3185
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:57,840
And I think uh, I it doesn't make any business sense why they would do that. I think it's just not their bread and butter and uh

3186
03:27:58,480 --> 03:28:00,480
maybe like when

3187
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:05,440
Companies want something printed. They already know what they have in mind

3188
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:09,440
And maybe they're less price sensitive, but I don't know

3189
03:28:10,080 --> 03:28:14,400
If someone works in a print shop, it could be interesting to figure out why I figure they're

3190
03:28:15,120 --> 03:28:17,440
They're just not focused on it. They're stuck in the past

3191
03:28:17,920 --> 03:28:21,360
Model of uh, you call somebody up and you ask for quotes or something

3192
03:28:22,640 --> 03:28:28,160
Anyhow, just wanted to let you know that you weren't alone and it's a problem everywhere and it's aggravating. I mean

3193
03:28:28,880 --> 03:28:30,880
Seems like there's a really simple solution

3194
03:28:32,400 --> 03:28:35,440
Just tell me the fucking formula you fucking hacks like

3195
03:28:36,480 --> 03:28:39,520
Crap, I was giving me the crappy patty formula, please

3196
03:28:40,320 --> 03:28:41,200
the

3197
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:43,280
The the mixam

3198
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:48,880
Was the company I used for the lot of ghosts and they have a really good online like quote

3199
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:54,400
You don't have to like give them your specifications. They don't email you later. You just type in the like

3200
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:57,120
Like whether you want it to be hardback or like

3201
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:00,400
Glossy I specifically mentioned how many pages

3202
03:29:00,960 --> 03:29:04,480
Uh, what page thickness and then they just give you exactly how much that would come

3203
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:11,120
I specifically mentioned mixam last episode as one that I found while I was looking around for alternatives

3204
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:15,680
Because uh, maybe you probably didn't catch it. Oh, no, you did. You said you did listen

3205
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:17,200
I

3206
03:29:17,200 --> 03:29:22,160
Yeah, they were quoting me like they were quoting me like 30 dollars plus on like per copy

3207
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:28,080
At my local print shop and I'm just not that's just not a uh, manageable

3208
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:31,200
Threshold

3209
03:29:31,200 --> 03:29:36,480
So that's full color. How many pages is slime and punishment? It would be uh, it

3210
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:42,960
It kind of depends. It would probably be somewhere around like 150 to 180

3211
03:29:43,440 --> 03:29:44,560
Ish

3212
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:48,240
Okay, so not insubstantial. Yeah, it's not insubstantial

3213
03:29:49,280 --> 03:29:50,000
um

3214
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:50,960
it

3215
03:29:50,960 --> 03:29:52,480
just so

3216
03:29:52,480 --> 03:29:57,760
Yeah, I print stuff through mixam too and I really fucking they get back to you quick too. Something's like wrong with your like

3217
03:29:58,160 --> 03:29:59,600
You know printing

3218
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:03,760
Cheesy did they send you a sample pack because I I tried to get them to send me a sample

3219
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:08,080
Pack of like different papers and they said it's like not available in my country

3220
03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:12,080
Which is very disappointing. They didn't send me a sample pack

3221
03:30:12,720 --> 03:30:15,200
Okay, who said that mixam

3222
03:30:16,240 --> 03:30:18,240
Mix it. Yeah, that uk based. That's why

3223
03:30:19,360 --> 03:30:23,520
Shifting is quite easy for me. Yeah, I just want to I just like trust them

3224
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:28,080
There were there were a few there were a couple alternatives that I was looking at too though

3225
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:32,160
So I may go with mixam or I may go with someone else, but uh, yeah

3226
03:30:32,960 --> 03:30:36,880
Okay, uh next one is called how do bicycles

3227
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:40,240
Stay up three two one go

3228
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:46,080
Hey crack if c is so good then how come endless war isn't written in c

3229
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:50,560
endless war. Yeah crack endless war is written in python

3230
03:30:51,920 --> 03:30:56,000
Uh, and I don't know why I don't know if there's a good reason for that

3231
03:30:56,000 --> 03:31:03,120
I just I just started writing it in python. I think you know, I think it might be

3232
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:07,200
Shit is it written in python just

3233
03:31:07,920 --> 03:31:13,520
Because I was learning no because I was learning python specifically to make endless war

3234
03:31:14,480 --> 03:31:19,520
And someone recommended python to me. I think I'm probably asked crack

3235
03:31:20,400 --> 03:31:23,200
And he recommended python as the language to do it in

3236
03:31:24,160 --> 03:31:29,280
But I don't remember why so yeah, you would have to ask him why it's and why it's not in c. I don't know

3237
03:31:30,080 --> 03:31:34,320
Uh, well crack was earlier in the call before I've been stepped in

3238
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:39,600
He did he was here before we started and he and he spewed a bunch of like racial slurs

3239
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:44,240
Yeah, yeah, I I believe you

3240
03:31:45,360 --> 03:31:48,400
Yeah, it's crazy. So I don't know. Do you have crack of

3241
03:31:49,280 --> 03:31:53,840
A characteristic behavior for him honestly. Yeah, just DM crack

3242
03:31:54,480 --> 03:32:00,240
Yeah, also there was a period where I would follow crack on twitter and he never followed me back. So I unfollowed him

3243
03:32:01,840 --> 03:32:08,720
Just want to throw that out there. That's uh, it's valid. That's a character character exposed

3244
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:14,480
Exposed, you know, you know me. I check everyone who follows or unfollows me. That's my that's the strat

3245
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:20,480
Next next voicemail is called a ramble three two one go

3246
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:24,480
Okay, so I'm just calling into vent. I have no idea what's going on in the episode

3247
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:27,280
But for some reason things weren't working well on my speak type on desktop

3248
03:32:27,280 --> 03:32:30,320
And it just wasn't picking up my audio even though when I did it on my mobile phone

3249
03:32:30,320 --> 03:32:31,440
It picked up things just fine

3250
03:32:31,440 --> 03:32:34,800
And I didn't know it was wrong given the fact that I could pick up my microphone fine on discord

3251
03:32:34,800 --> 03:32:36,800
But it turns out if I go into my audio settings

3252
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:39,280
I didn't have my microphone set correctly

3253
03:32:39,280 --> 03:32:44,080
So make sure that you set your microphone correctly in your audio setting so that make sure that people can hear your voice

3254
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:48,480
You guys understand that also give a good job with the game. I'm glad to see that you were able to make that

3255
03:32:48,480 --> 03:32:51,280
And I hope you can make more in the future. Yay. Thank you

03:33:03,360 --> 03:33:06,240
Uh, check check your microphone settings everyone

3263
03:33:24,400 --> 03:33:28,240
Yeah, thank you for thank you for that sound effect. I will use it in the game

3264
03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:30,800
That guy sounds like they were in pain

3265
03:33:31,200 --> 03:33:37,040
Uh, he could be next one is called pcp revolution three two one go

3266
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:40,400
Remember when jesse during raccoon four was like

3267
03:33:41,280 --> 03:33:46,000
Man, it'd be great if the there's a pcp revolution where everyone was against each other

3268
03:33:46,080 --> 03:33:50,320
They'll hate each other the pcp breaks up and all that she needs like I would love that

3269
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:56,080
And look what happened now that basically happened. I don't remember jesse's dream came true

3270
03:33:56,640 --> 03:33:58,640
pcp revolution forever

3271
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:02,880
We should change the name of the of the show to pcp revolutions

3272
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:07,520
Uh, I don't that sounds like something he would say I don't specifically remember

3273
03:34:08,400 --> 03:34:10,400
him saying that but that it's

3274
03:34:11,040 --> 03:34:16,240
It must have been in a video or something. It must have been in a video

3291
03:35:24,400 --> 03:35:26,400
Slave and over a hot stove

3292
03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:28,800
You're welcome. That's how much I care

3293
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:31,520

3295
03:35:38,160 --> 03:35:42,480
Good day slime city. Good. Welcome back to the slime times weekend update

3296
03:35:42,880 --> 03:35:49,520
This week features some spectral news an old state ad by the name of taco a living taco from outer space

3297
03:35:49,760 --> 03:35:52,720
Has made their return to the slimy streets and the sewers

3298
03:35:53,200 --> 03:35:54,240
in addition

3299
03:35:54,240 --> 03:36:00,480
This week marks the one year anniversary of state ad auger don refusing to revive as state ads tend to do

3300
03:36:00,720 --> 03:36:05,600
auger don is in my lord of ghost comic cap and metalheads animal fact segment

3301
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:11,600
Which has been going daily for what has to be over a literal year. Yes approaching its 700th installment

3302
03:36:12,080 --> 03:36:17,920
The skeleton-based fellow has reported on regular fauna and slime based life forms alike

3303
03:36:18,400 --> 03:36:22,400
And we're excited to see what special info he brings us during the anniversary

3304
03:36:23,040 --> 03:36:28,320
Finally, there seems to be a contest going on for people regaling others about their epic back stories

3305
03:36:28,880 --> 03:36:34,320
Word on the street is the new los angeles literary community is getting especially excited about it

3306
03:36:34,960 --> 03:36:36,640
curious

3307
03:36:36,640 --> 03:36:42,000
That's it for this week. We hope to see you next time and remember the slime time is the best time

3308
03:36:43,040 --> 03:36:47,040
Thank you. It really is the best time. Thank you, uh prince isolation

3309
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:52,640
the uh, yeah, I remember in the last contest judging a bunch of people were talking about

3310
03:36:53,360 --> 03:37:00,240
Captain metal heads animal facts segment, uh, which I thought at first was in an anamorphon time

3311
03:37:01,200 --> 03:37:06,960
Reference because they have an animal facts segment on that show, but I guess not it's just independently

3312
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:09,200
independent

3313
03:37:09,200 --> 03:37:11,200
convergent evolution

3314
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:14,320
700 insolence

3315
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:17,120
Wow, um

3316
03:37:17,440 --> 03:37:18,960
and then

3317
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:20,320
uh

3318
03:37:20,320 --> 03:37:26,640
Oh, yeah the uh, yeah the backstory contest the the theme for the next. This was my idea. I thought it would be pretty good

3319
03:37:27,520 --> 03:37:33,040
Uh, the theme for the next contest is like people it's like tell your backstory. What is your

3320
03:37:33,760 --> 03:37:38,560
What is your your oc? What's there? What's their deal? What's their what's their backstory?

3321
03:37:38,800 --> 03:37:44,320
What's yeah, what's going on there? Yeah, because because everyone's got because everyone's got like some weird stupid

3322
03:37:44,960 --> 03:37:47,840
avatar, right? Everyone is like a sentient like

3323
03:37:48,480 --> 03:37:51,840
piece of bread or like a like a you know a fish

3324
03:37:52,480 --> 03:37:55,920
A fish with a gun coming out of its mouth or something everyone's some dumb thing

3325
03:37:56,480 --> 03:38:01,920
Everyone's like what where what's your what's your what's what are you right? Like what like why are you here?

3326
03:38:02,160 --> 03:38:04,960
Well, how did you end up in slime city, right?

3327
03:38:05,200 --> 03:38:07,600
Everyone's a blimbo everyone's a squimbo

3328
03:38:07,920 --> 03:38:11,360
Everyone is scrimblified. We're extremely scrimblified over in

3329
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:16,560
The scrimblified population you should be able to you you can pick your race

3330
03:38:16,720 --> 03:38:19,280
You should be able to uh, you should be able to spec into scrimblow

3331
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:24,720
That would be pretty good. That would that's a mechanic that endless war could use and would use

3332
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:32,800
I am I called my the style of characters that aren't going versus us scrimblows. They're uh, grimblows

3333
03:38:33,680 --> 03:38:34,720
Oh

3334
03:38:34,720 --> 03:38:38,560
Good wouldn't want them to be wouldn't want them to to to be uh,

3335
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:45,440
Too similar or anything. No, I don't want them to be scrimblows. I gotta be grimblows. You know just edgy or scrimblows

3336
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:49,040
Much much better much better with angry eyes

3337
03:38:49,440 --> 03:38:53,760
I guess all your eyes is a grim blow and and sharp teeth. Everyone has sharp teeth

3338
03:38:55,920 --> 03:39:02,320
Next voicemail is uh, what is it called base? It's just called base three. We're almost done. But we have three more

3339
03:39:03,360 --> 03:39:05,360

3340
03:39:06,960 --> 03:39:08,960
Hello, Ben

3341

Yay, thank you. Thank you. You too and you too and you too voicemailer

3345
03:39:28,320 --> 03:39:29,600
they

3346
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:36,560
He said he said, uh, we're based here and you're not he said any potential guests are based except for cheesy manfredo

3347
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:40,320
Damn, he said that really quickly. I know it's really messed up

3348
03:39:40,960 --> 03:39:48,080
Yeah, I hear that from my mom every single day. She's like, yeah, he's pretty based after when cheesy's on but i'm like, but mom i'm cheesy

3349
03:39:49,280 --> 03:39:54,160
Uh, she she said, uh, whatever happened to the pizza party podcast. I never liked him on that either

3350
03:39:54,400 --> 03:39:56,400
Yeah

3351
03:39:56,720 --> 03:40:01,280
That boy that boy. He's just uh, he's a he's toxic for podcasts. He's

3352
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:03,280
poisoned

3353
03:40:03,280 --> 03:40:05,280
He's fucking problematic

3354
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:06,960
problematic

3355
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:12,400
Uh, next next voicemail is called. It's ya boy three two one go

3356
03:40:13,200 --> 03:40:19,760
Hey guys, it's your boy here. Just letting you know that yix studio is officially dead boy gazers is no longer on yix studio anymore

3357
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:25,680
Fuck trixie. Fuck you. Fuck everyone on there. Fuck you. We saw we saw that uh,

3358
03:40:26,560 --> 03:40:27,760
shunt it off

3359
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:29,760
I I

3360
03:40:29,760 --> 03:40:31,760
I don't get why though

3361
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:33,600
What do you mean?

3362
03:40:33,600 --> 03:40:36,800
But why is it different if all the same people are doing it?

3363
03:40:37,520 --> 03:40:40,480
Well, it's a different. Yeah. Well, it's a different show

3364
03:40:41,920 --> 03:40:46,640
Because in the sense that it's uh, it's no longer like video. It's just it's just audio

3365
03:40:47,200 --> 03:40:49,200
That's why it's the podcast now

3366
03:40:49,760 --> 03:40:51,760
They it's funny they

3367
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:58,720
Riley called void. He he used to consistently call void gazers a podcast even though it's obviously not one

3368
03:40:58,800 --> 03:41:00,800
It's obviously like a vlog

3369
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:02,480
Slash like

3370
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:08,480
I guess you maybe could call we could generously call it like a variety show like a variety comedy show the times they would

3371
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:10,320
do like

3372
03:41:10,320 --> 03:41:15,440
Live like, you know, it's like question people about stuff on the street or whatever

3373
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:17,200
um

3374
03:41:17,200 --> 03:41:20,240
So it was definitely not a podcast, but he always called it one

3375
03:41:20,640 --> 03:41:26,800
But now it's the pot. It's the new void gazers podcast, which is an actual podcast, which is just them talking

3376
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:29,520
Uh

3377
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:31,280
So I

3378
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:33,280
So, I mean, yeah

3379
03:41:33,600 --> 03:41:40,880
I get I I think I think that's why because there's no more there's no more video component or uh, or riley just doesn't want to edit video anymore

3380
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:43,760
Uh, so now it's

3381
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:47,840
Now it's the podcast now it's on his channel and that's what he wants. He wants that content

3382
03:41:48,480 --> 03:41:49,920
Now he's got it

3383
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:51,680
I'm good for him

3384
03:41:51,680 --> 03:41:53,360
All right

3385
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:55,360
One more voicemail

3386
03:41:55,680 --> 03:41:57,600
One more voicemail

3387
03:41:57,600 --> 03:41:59,600
Is uh, Nate is back

3388
03:42:00,080 --> 03:42:02,080
three two one go

3389
03:42:02,880 --> 03:42:05,200
I'm reaching back today. Thank you boys. That's good

3390
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:10,480
Yeah

3391
03:42:10,960 --> 03:42:12,960
Wow, you're excited. Yeah

3392
03:42:13,840 --> 03:42:15,840
I love voicemails

3393
03:42:17,440 --> 03:42:19,440
Okay, well, that's it we listen to them all

3394
03:42:20,240 --> 03:42:21,760
Oh good

3395
03:42:21,760 --> 03:42:25,200
Somehow I had big nice. We did it. Yeah. Yeah

3396
03:42:25,760 --> 03:42:30,160
And only under four hours. Excellent. Uh, god, are we under four?

3397
03:42:30,800 --> 03:42:33,120
We're just yeah, we we we kept it under four

3398
03:42:33,680 --> 03:42:38,640
Shit, I had somewhere to I had somewhere to be at four actually. So that's a little fucked up. That's why I had to uh

3399
03:42:39,520 --> 03:42:40,480
Oh, well

3400
03:42:40,480 --> 03:42:45,600
Oh, well, uh, anyway any final thoughts before we conclude today's episode

3401
03:42:46,320 --> 03:42:48,320
Play pumpkin alley

3402
03:42:48,640 --> 03:42:53,520
Free demo you don't even have to pay, but it's nice if you do but you don't have to and

3403
03:42:54,080 --> 03:42:56,560
Leave feedback and look forward to

3404
03:42:57,520 --> 03:43:01,040
Kickstarter and other things in relation to it. So I was

3405
03:43:01,520 --> 03:43:07,120
Ish I was kind of curious actually I wanted to ask and I don't know if you'd be comfortable talking about this

3406
03:43:07,120 --> 03:43:10,560
But I was wondering if you like made any money in donations

3407
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:15,600
Because I'm all I'm also hoping that people will donate to my to my game when it's out

3408
03:43:16,480 --> 03:43:18,480
We got a few donations. Yeah

3409
03:43:18,960 --> 03:43:21,920
Yeah, I think I got a big one from crack actually. That was nice

3410
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:24,320
Oh, wow

3411
03:43:24,320 --> 03:43:28,000
Uh, can I like how many people donated? Uh, I don't have the

3412
03:43:28,800 --> 03:43:32,320
The numbers it's like maybe 10 people

3413
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:36,560
It's something it's not it's not nothing. So it's pretty good

3414
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:41,040
Uh, well, I mean, uh, I don't hopefully more will trickle in

3415
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:45,200
I mean the the the point of the demo is not to make money is just to show people

3416
03:43:45,600 --> 03:43:50,400
To have something to show people when we're trying to like actually fund it and make the real thing. Yeah

3417
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:57,360
Yeah, sure. Sure. Um, it's also a good thing. We can like bring to like a games convention and say, hey, we're working on a game

3418
03:43:58,080 --> 03:44:00,480
Any journalists want to write an article about it?

3419
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:03,840
Yeah, I uh

3420
03:44:04,320 --> 03:44:08,880
You should have pushed the diversity angle. Here's a game made by a trans creator

3421
03:44:10,160 --> 03:44:12,800
I guess I guess I could throw that in there if it will work

3422
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:18,160
For a thing or two, but I don't really care. But then for then wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute

3423
03:44:18,720 --> 03:44:25,600
Wait a minute a a trans gender game developer. Are you are you are you serious?

3424
03:44:29,120 --> 03:44:31,120
Are you

3425
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:36,000
Unfathomable

3426
03:44:36,480 --> 03:44:41,040
Yeah, um, I don't know. I said gamer. I know trans people. So I don't think I'm gonna

3427
03:44:41,840 --> 03:44:46,240
Partake in this. Well, well, well gamers and game developers are like natural enemies

3428
03:44:46,320 --> 03:44:50,800
They're like lions and hyenas. They hate each other and they always will true true

3429
03:44:51,520 --> 03:44:54,480
True. It's uh, it's it's a abusive relationship. They share

3430
03:44:55,120 --> 03:44:59,680
Quite toxic to one another. Mm-hmm. I want the game to stand on its own. Um

3431
03:45:00,640 --> 03:45:06,960
First and foremost, I get you if I need if it could help I'll just say, um, yeah, can I have a table at this con?

3432
03:45:07,280 --> 03:45:11,760
Sorry, we're booked. Well, I am trans. Sorry, please. No, sorry

3433
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:19,360
No, no, no, no cis people allowed at this convention. Yeah, no sissies at this convention

3434
03:45:19,520 --> 03:45:23,040
I'll I'll weaponize my minority status if I need to

3435
03:45:23,840 --> 03:45:27,280
But like I don't I don't care. Put that put that sound bite sound bite

3436
03:45:28,240 --> 03:45:30,240
I'll bludgeon people

3437
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:39,200
Yeah, just just as you apply to convention. Just letting you know, I am trans. They're like, um, this is a transformers convention

3438
03:45:39,280 --> 03:45:45,760
It's not the same thing. Just letting letting you know. I'm trans. Uh, uh, sorry, uh, don't care that much

3439
03:45:45,840 --> 03:45:49,120
And it just smacks your own head with a hammer and I'm disabled now

3440
03:45:49,680 --> 03:45:51,680
Plus ratio plus

3441
03:45:52,640 --> 03:45:59,120
Yeah, yes, it's it's like the like a version of like, uh, do you know who I am? I'm making youtube videos. Um

3442
03:46:00,320 --> 03:46:05,280
Yeah, I have the I have so much social cloud. I could make you take a big L if you don't let me in

3443
03:46:06,640 --> 03:46:12,800

3458
03:47:11,840 --> 03:47:15,280
Because I love money so much. Let me just ching ching

3459
03:47:16,160 --> 03:47:18,800
Okay, now it's my turn mom says it's my turn to show

3460
03:47:19,440 --> 03:47:21,440
Okay, so I I have

3461
03:47:22,080 --> 03:47:24,080
Read everyone read Villainverse everyone

3462
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:29,200
If you have not read Villainverse, please read Villainverse. It's actually good. It's free to read or not

3463
03:47:29,920 --> 03:47:36,320
Actually, um, if you and you remember back in that shonen contest where everyone was posting their comic on medibang

3464
03:47:36,800 --> 03:47:37,600
Yes

3465
03:47:37,600 --> 03:47:38,640
You remember that

3466
03:47:38,640 --> 03:47:42,880
Oh, you mean um this the show the jump the one that give entered Clarissa in

3467
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:45,280
Yeah, yeah that one right so

3468
03:47:46,160 --> 03:47:48,160
Villainverse is on medibang

3469
03:47:49,120 --> 03:47:55,360
And I looked at kind of like the ranking for like I guess I guess medibang just shows you kind of like western comics or anything

3470
03:47:55,360 --> 03:47:57,360
That's like in english instead of like

3471
03:47:57,520 --> 03:47:59,920
The popular stuff in japan, right?

3472
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:06,480
And it got me and I saw like kind of like how popular kind of like western stuff is in medibang

3473
03:48:06,640 --> 03:48:09,200
And like it only gets a handful of likes

3474
03:48:09,840 --> 03:48:11,840
and and I and I see that um

3475
03:48:13,520 --> 03:48:18,880
I see that I tend to have like a bigger following than a lot of these other like western comics guys

3476
03:48:18,880 --> 03:48:22,400
So I'm like if anyone out there is a fan of Villainverse and you have a medibang account

3477
03:48:22,960 --> 03:48:25,680
Um, go to medibang. I mean just look at Villainverse

3478
03:48:26,080 --> 03:48:29,440
Go yeah, look at Villainverse on medibang and just give it a couple likes

3479
03:48:29,440 --> 03:48:33,200
And I'm pretty sure I could get pushed to the top of the ranking just with a handful of likes

3480
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:35,200
Yeah

3481
03:48:35,200 --> 03:48:38,880
Yeah, dog and I'm yeah, I'm still cheesy manfredo on medibang

3482
03:48:40,400 --> 03:48:47,120
Uh, check them out. Check out. Check out cheesy manfredo on medibang. So is that where is that the only place the comic you can you can get

3483
03:48:47,840 --> 03:48:52,960
Is on medibang or is there the Villainverse? You you can read it on medibang. You can read it on tumblr

3484
03:48:52,960 --> 03:48:58,000
There's actually a discord this villainverse discord where it has a chat that just has the whole comic right there

3485
03:48:58,640 --> 03:49:05,040
And people can read it by the box by the books. They're all on itch. Also. I have new books

3486
03:49:05,600 --> 03:49:09,600
If anyone remembers luna from bongo luna, I have made two porn comics

3487
03:49:10,240 --> 03:49:12,880
And those are on itch. They're called graveyard smash

3488
03:49:13,680 --> 03:49:18,800
Yeah, and I yeah, they're pretty good. Um, she bangs a werewolf then she bangs a ghost and

3489
03:49:19,600 --> 03:49:22,080
I don't know what she's gonna. I don't know what she's gonna bang the third book

3490
03:49:22,160 --> 03:49:24,160
But it's not gonna be a ghost or a werewolf

3491
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:30,960
Yes, yes toby fox crossover

3492
03:49:31,920 --> 03:49:37,680
Uh, I was gonna say a revenant, but those are those are just zombies basically those are just zombies. I can talk

3493
03:49:38,160 --> 03:49:39,520
So that sucks

3494
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:45,120
She needs to bang someone with a vagina in the third book. We already have like two penises in a row. We need a vagina

3495
03:49:45,200 --> 03:49:48,000
I would say succubus then a fuck you. Yes

3496
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:51,920
Herm Herm I might go with that angle

3497
03:49:51,920 --> 03:49:58,960
So I got that going on for me and the nsfw account is a creamy pasta tc on twitter

3498
03:49:59,920 --> 03:50:03,760
And I post a lot of uh, I'm actually doing reduces have vaginas

3499
03:50:06,400 --> 03:50:08,400
Everybody knows that everybody knows

3500
03:50:08,800 --> 03:50:12,320
Medusa has vagina. I checked. I looked at her vagina not her face

3501
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was uh, it was a perfect plan

3502
03:50:16,480 --> 03:50:21,120
Work her work perfect. If you look at her vagina, you become unstowned. Oh, no

3503
03:50:21,360 --> 03:50:25,760
She saw her own face reflected in her vagina and turned herself to stone

3504
03:50:26,320 --> 03:50:28,320
Fuck

3505
03:50:28,640 --> 03:50:30,640
Excellent. So yeah, I got

3506
03:50:30,880 --> 03:50:37,280
She was she was so horny that's like she she her vagina juices drip down her legs and formed a slick

3507
03:50:38,000 --> 03:50:41,200
Shiny pool at her feet and she looked down and saw her own face

3508
03:50:41,920 --> 03:50:43,680
No

3509
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:44,880
tragic

3510
03:50:44,880 --> 03:50:50,960
But who hasn't been there am I right ladies who hasn't slipped am I right ladies who hasn't slipped on your own pussy juices

3511
03:50:51,360 --> 03:50:53,760
Where you're walking down the stairs and snap your own neck

3512
03:50:54,080 --> 03:50:54,880
It's just you know

3513
03:50:54,880 --> 03:51:01,040
It's just like when when you're playing a handheld video game and then the screen turns off and you're you're there and you're looking down

3514
03:51:01,200 --> 03:51:05,920
And like you got double chins because you're looking down and like you look you're old and you look like shit

3515
03:51:06,320 --> 03:51:11,600
It's like that when you when you're so horny that you just piss pussy juice out into a big slippery puddle on the ground

3516
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:13,920
And you look down and you see your own face and you go

3517
03:51:15,120 --> 03:51:17,120
How do they get so old and stupid?

3518
03:51:17,440 --> 03:51:21,120
Oh, you know, it's just it's just hashtag just medusa things

3519
03:51:23,680 --> 03:51:29,200
Medusa's historically they have snakes for hair and they have an incredibly heavy flow

3520
03:51:29,440 --> 03:51:31,440
All right, an incredibly heavy flow

3521
03:51:31,520 --> 03:51:33,520
Vaginal flow is what i'm referring to

3522
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:35,840
I I love all this new

3523
03:51:35,840 --> 03:51:38,240
