00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,560
Hello! Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. What? Craig. And immediately Craig craps out.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
That's fine. We don't need him.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
That's a good way to start an episode.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,320
Craig is like, no, I won't record. Fuck you, Craig. All we need is me, Ben Saint, and my

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,120
good friend, Gamers Tavern here.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,800
Uh, what's long, hard, wet, and full of semen? A submarine.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:50,840
Oh, God. God. Um, Gamers Tavern. I was, uh, last night, I went on the, uh, the podcast

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:01:00,680
Shreddit. And, uh, this was a guy, a guy, Pyro, who I, who I knew from the Minecraft

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,560
stream, uh, and he introduced me to, uh, Murilogic, that fucking moron.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
Oh yeah, I know who that is. Uh, it's the Wonderbred guy, right?

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Murilogic is the Wonderbred guy. Um, but that's-

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,320
Yeah, I saw you did a, uh, episode with him. I haven't listened to it yet.

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,240
Everyone, everyone hated him. And, and, and for good reason.

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, I looked at the comments.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Lamal.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,960
And, uh, people didn't seem too happy about it.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:39,520
Very funny. Very amusing, uh, uh, to me. The plan worked perfectly. Um, uh, uh, uh,

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,600
but I went on, uh, yeah, that guy, Pyro, uh, he has his podcast Shreddit. It's not only

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,320
his, there are other people, whatever. I went on Shreddit and we talked about adultery.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,520
We went on r slash adultery and we read tales from adulterers that wanted to post online

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:07,440
about their adultery. And you just reminded me of the, one of the stories that I was particularly

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,160
aggrieved by, and I'll sum it up for you here. The story basically went, man who is

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,360
cheating on his wife, goes to the grocery store and gets a call from his wife and the

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,160
wife says, honey, pick me up an avocado. And he says, what kind? And she says, a big hard

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:38,980
one. And he smirks, uh, impishly and says, uh, well, he's like, I'm gonna, I'm going

26
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,400
to amuse my wife who remember I have been cheating on for years now, but I'm gonna,

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm gonna give her a treat. She, she, she's earned a treat. So I'm gonna give her, I'm

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,200
gonna show her a good time. And he says, I got a big hard one for you right here. And

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,160
his wife, who obviously loathes him, obviously detests this man and cannot fucking stand

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:10,880
to hear him say anything at all. She says, why would you say that? And he is like, I

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,800
can't believe that. Can't believe my joke didn't get appreciated. And then so he calls

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:23,960
up his, his mistress or in the parlance of R slash adultery, his AF or a fair partner.

33
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:31,800
And he says, Hey, sweetie, sweetie bushel, uh, if I said, if you, if you said, um, if

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:39,480
I said, I got a big hard one, a big hard one, what would you say? And she says, I got a

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,200
big hard one for you right here. And he says, Oh my God, this is why, this is why I cheat.

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,320
This is what it's all about. She's such a, such a free spirit, such a wonderful soul.

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,480
You know, she's got such a, such a glowing sense of humor. She understands me. We get

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,800
each other. She appreciates me. This woman appreciates you. Not like my, not like my

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,680
dumb wife, who hates me for who, for who have been cheating on for decades and hates me

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,000
for some reason. You know, this woman gets me and thank you are slash adultery for getting

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,040
me this woman who appreciates my biting wit. But that's what I need. Anyway, I'm saying

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:31,280
that you are this man. Yeah, pretty much. It's not true. It's not true. You're, you're

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
a man of good, outstanding moral character, gamers tavern. And I know that because you

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,120
are here now on the podcast with me, unlike everyone else who has abandoned their posts,

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,880
left me to defend the Alamo against the arm of a single cannon. I basically say it.

46
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,240
Come and take it. I say another solo then cast it. I guess it would have been another

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:04,600
solo been cast. Um, we had, we, other people were supposed to be here. We even had another

48
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,000
guest lined up. There was another guest who was supposed to come on this week and just

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,480
nobody's here. And, and, and I, I, I do not understand it, but it's okay. We're gonna,

50
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
we're gonna be fine. All right. This, the show must go on.

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,880
Well, maybe eventually it's just going to be just us running the entire thing.

52
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,760
God, I hope so. I hope so. It's squatters rights. You know, if nobody, if nobody shows

53
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,040
up to the podcast for long enough, it becomes our podcast.

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,680
Uh, yeah, that's, that's my understanding. That's the rule. That's why you basically

55
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
run the show now because Nate doesn't show up anymore, right?

56
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Um, basically,

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,440
you know, it's funny because, um, the first time I was on in 2018, I believe it was Nate

58
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
who invited me on.

59
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,520
Hmm. I think that's sound, that's probably right.

60
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:05,240
And, uh, back then I didn't know who he was or I didn't know anything about the PCP itself.

61
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,320
So is, um, I had to do a lot of research before I came on back then.

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,440
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He had to dig up all our skeletons.

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,000
But I did, um, I didn't know, uh, of you had to, had to make sure none of us had ever

64
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
said the N word.

65
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah.

66
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry we disappointed you.

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,080
You couldn't do it.

68
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I did know about you and, um, uh, Jesse and, uh, Gib before I was on, but I didn't know

69
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,560
that you three knew each other and that you all did a podcast together. That's, uh, I

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,960
discovered later.

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
You knew me and Jesse and Gib.

72
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Yeah, I knew you from Twitter.

73
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Oh yeah.

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
You followed me on Twitter and you tweeted stuff.

75
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,920
I knew Gib and Jesse because they left comments on my videos and I checked out their channels

77
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
back then.

78
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
I never, I never leave comments on videos.

79
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Almost, I almost never do that.

80
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't really do that either anymore.

81
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah. Twitter though. I'll leave, I'll leave a comment on Twitter.

82
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Oh, I'll, I'll leave a reply thread on Twitter.

83
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Yeah, I see. I've been pretty active on Twitter.

84
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I've been too active on Twitter.

85
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
It fucking sucks.

86
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Hey, you should probably, uh, uh, hold back on that.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Twitter is not, um, it's not too great of a place to spend all your time.

88
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,880
No, no, it's bad.

89
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
But I'm just so powerless in my life.

90
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,880
But you know, Twitter gives me the illusion that I can affect change.

91
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Yeah. But I saw something kind of interesting about the Wonder Bread guy.

92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Um, because I looked at the comments of the video, uh, that you posted with him.

93
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,880
And most of the comments that mentioned him were pretty negative.

94
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Yes.

95
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,880
But then on Twitter, uh, I think you tweeted or somebody tweeted the episode on Twitter.

96
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
And the comments on Twitter.

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
I did and did you did.

98
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Right. So the, the comments on Twitter were actually pretty positive or neutral.

99
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
I hardly saw anything negative.

100
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
So, uh,

101
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,880
There were, there were a lot more comments than there were Twitter replies though.

102
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah.

103
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,880
But it was just interesting how, uh, on Twitter it was mostly positive and neutral.

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
And in your comments section, it was mostly negative.

105
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:35,880
The, the, I mean, there's, there's, you know, I don't, I don't want to go too hard on it

106
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,880
because I pretty much agreed with every comment from last, last week.

107
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I was right.

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
I was right there with those commenters.

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Like, yeah.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Yes.

111
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Correct.

112
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Um, but our comment section is, is a pretty negative place pretty often.

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Yeah.

114
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I'm surprised, you know, uh, I didn't get very, very many, many negative comments, uh,

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
both times that I was on.

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
We didn't, we get, uh, you know, it's fine.

117
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
It's not a problem.

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
But yeah, we get, we get a lot of, we get a lot of, we get a lot of good faith.

119
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,880
We get a lot of good faith criticism down in the comments.

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,880
We get a lot of people saying, uh, giving, giving us a helpful, helpful tips on how we

121
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
can improve the show.

122
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Yeah.

123
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Um, I remember, uh, one of the comments I read on, on the last episode I was on, they

124
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,880
were like, uh, oh yeah, that gamer's Taiwan guy back when the PSP used to be good.

125
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Um, good old days.

126
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Yeah.

127
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
The funny thing is back when I first was on in 2018, even back then I saw comments on

128
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,880
that episode that I was on that was like, uh, the PCP is on a downward spiral.

129
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
It's not as good as it used to be.

130
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,880
You know, even back then in the good old days.

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Yeah.

132
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,880
You know, life is basically just one big decline into nothingness.

133
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Well, if you want to look at it that way, I guess so.

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,880
And you know, that's just, you know, PCP is no exception.

135
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Uh, yeah.

136
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Although I do think, uh, sometimes people, uh, will, um, they will, they will have a better

137
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,880
opinion of the past than is actually realistic.

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Yeah.

139
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah.

140
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I mean, I think so for sure.

141
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,880
But, uh, as far as the PCP is concerned, they're probably, uh, correct this case.

142
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Uh, uh, I mean, you know, when the, I mean, if anything was like more, uh, uh, exciting

143
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,880
in a way, everything, you know, novelty is just fun.

144
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,880
And so like just one of things newer, it's kind of just more exciting, like by default.

145
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Uh, you know, what can you do?

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Yeah.

147
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,880
That reminds me actually, um, I think that's the reason why, in my opinion.

148
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Uh, the game groups are not good anymore.

149
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Hmm.

150
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Because I haven't watched the game group in forever.

151
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Uh, when John was on the game groups, in my opinion, was pretty good.

152
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,880
And then when he left, it started to be less good.

153
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
But I don't think that's because of John leaving.

154
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,880
I think that's just because, um, the novelty wore off and they were no longer excited about

155
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
the project they were doing.

156
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Uh, man, I don't know.

157
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I listened to a bunch of game grumps.

158
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Like, I think I listened to a bunch like pretty shortly post Dan swap.

159
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Uh, so like the first game grumps I ever really listened to was a bunch of like early Dan.

160
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
And I thought that was pretty good.

161
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
And then I went back and I listened to John and Aaron.

162
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
And I thought that was pretty good.

163
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
And then I maybe listened to a little more Dan and I was like, yeah, this is good.

164
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
And then I just stopped listening because like, yeah, I get it.

165
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Well, I checked out some of the newer episodes.

166
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I go back every once in a while just to check on them because I used to like them a lot.

167
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:12,880
And now I find it really difficult to listen to the newest ones because you can kind of tell that both Aaron and Dan don't, uh, their hearts just not in it anymore.

168
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
That's a bummer.

169
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
That's not a good feeling.

170
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,880
They become like a typical nine to five job for them.

171
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Yeah, I mean, how could it, how could it not?

172
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I mean, that's literally what it is.

173
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,880
You can't do that for years and still care about it.

174
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
You must, you must settle into a routine at some point.

175
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
But I have to feign interest.

176
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,880
I have to pretend that they still are as into it as before.

177
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Yeah, of course.

178
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
You know, for the sake of the audience.

179
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
For the sake of the audience.

180
00:12:49,880 --> 00:13:00,880
But in my opinion, I don't know, this is controversial to say, but I think Dan should pull a John and leave Game Grumps and do his own projects.

181
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,880
I mean, Dan did his own projects before and I mean, some of them were kind of successful.

182
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Because he has his own band.

183
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Yeah, he's always had his own band.

184
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Yeah, but I mean, imagine if he just did that full time instead of splitting his time between that and Game Grumps.

185
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I mean, I kind of, he already kind of does both, doesn't he?

186
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Yeah, but I would prefer to see him do more of the music stuff, which I think is better.

187
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Because you're only one person, you can't do too much at a time.

188
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,880
It's like if he just focused 100% on the music, he could probably make more music and better music.

189
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,880
I mean, maybe, perhaps, perhaps.

190
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
As opposed to spending his time.

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:07,880
It's not necessarily the case that like, if he had more time to do it, that he would do more of it or make better.

192
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I mean, it could just be that like, I don't know, maybe Game Grumps takes enough of his time that the amount that he's got left over is, you know, give or take the amount that he likes to spend on music.

193
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,880
And if he spent more time than that on music, it would be less productive, you know?

194
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Yeah, I suppose that's a good point.

195
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
It's possible.

196
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:43,880
But I think that's why John claims to have left Game Grumps because he wanted more time to work on his own content.

197
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
So I'm just going by that logic.

198
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,880
But of course, that might have not been why he left.

199
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
No, I don't think so.

200
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,880
No, there was bad blood, right? There was bad blood.

201
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Possibly. It's never been confirmed.

202
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Yeah.

203
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,880
You know, I'm not a huge fan of like, Dan's music.

204
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm not a big, I'm not a big Ninja Sex Party fan, honestly.

205
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,880
So I, you know, and I'm also not a big Game Grumps fan anymore.

206
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
So I guess I don't give a fuck what he does.

207
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I actually do like Dan's music.

208
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I think it's, it kind of reminds me of like a sign filmed if it was music.

209
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
It's my kind of humor.

210
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I mean, I haven't listened to a ton of it.

211
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I've listened to some and I thought, like back in the day, I heard the Unicorn Wizard one and I was like, that's pretty funny.

212
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
And then I've heard, you know, other songs since then.

213
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,880
And usually I'm like, okay, it kind of feels the same.

214
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,880
I guess it's true that it's all kind of themed after a similar thing.

215
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
But there are a couple of songs he's done that I really like.

216
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,880
One of them for obvious reasons is I think it's called Objects of Desire.

217
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,880
And it's basically all puns.

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Objects of Desire. Okay.

219
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,880
It's the entire song is puns.

220
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
So obviously I'm a huge fan.

221
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Can you, can you, can you give us a sample?

222
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,880
What are some good lines?

223
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I didn't memorize any of the lines, unfortunately.

224
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I memorized my own stuff, but I don't memorize other people's stuff.

225
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Okay.

226
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
All right.

227
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I know you're shy.

228
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I get it.

229
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
It's fine.

230
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
You don't know.

231
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
I just don't legitimately don't remember.

232
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I think there is one line in it because every, every song he does has a plot kind of.

233
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Yeah.

234
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
So the plot is that he moved in with, with this new girlfriend he got.

235
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,880
And then he reveals the secret that he's having sex with all her objects.

236
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
And all the puns are based on that.

237
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,880
So I think there's one that's like, I'm going down on your stairs, which is.

238
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Okay.

239
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Great.

240
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
And that's pretty good.

241
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm slamming your door.

242
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
All right.

243
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Okay.

244
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
So that's, that gets the official gamer's tavern seal of approval.

245
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah.

246
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
That sounds about right.

247
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
All right.

248
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
That's reasonable.

249
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,880
And I think another song that he did that I really like just because of how absurd it

250
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
is.

251
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
It's like the, the story of it is funny.

252
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,880
And it sounds pretty good too, but it's like a story where he sets up a woman's rights

253
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
seminar or something like that.

254
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,880
And by giving them in solidarity, you know, empowerment, empowering messages.

255
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,880
But the thing is the empowering message he gives them is just that they can do him, you

256
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
know.

257
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Hmm.

258
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Yeah.

259
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,880
If they, if they work hard enough someday, they'll get to be able to sleep with a ninja

260
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
sex party.

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Very nice.

262
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
And then that's true.

263
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,880
They all get really upset and grossed out and start to leave.

264
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
So it's unbelievable.

265
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
The audacity.

266
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Yeah.

267
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:33,880
So it's that kind of a, it's basically just in my mind is like the George Costanza

268
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,880
relationship comedy, but in musical band form.

269
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,880
You know, many trying to go after women and striking out in funny ways and coming up with

270
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
elaborate schemes to, to get with women.

271
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
I kind of like that story story of my life.

272
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Yeah.

273
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I kind of like that type of comedy.

274
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Did you ever listen to starbomb?

275
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Yeah, I listened to it.

276
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
You must have.

277
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
What did you think of it?

278
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
I thought the first album was all right.

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
It had a couple of catchy songs.

280
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,880
And I thought the second one was pretty underwhelming and I didn't listen to it much.

281
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I wasn't.

282
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
I thought I listened to the first one a ton either.

283
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I thought, I thought it was all fine, but I wasn't really that into it.

284
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Yeah.

285
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Which is ironic because I'm supposed to be in the gamers tavern.

286
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,880
I was, I guess, you know, this, like it came out like at the time, the first one came out

287
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,880
like when I was sort of into listening to gamers tavern or law.

288
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Who would listen to gamers tavern?

289
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Nobody.

290
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:48,880
When I was listening to, when I was listening to a fucking, a fucking game grumps.

291
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Yes.

292
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Game grumps.

293
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
So I was like obligatorily.

294
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Okay.

295
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
They put an album.

296
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Gotta go check the album out.

297
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And I did.

298
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Okay.

299
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
This is fine.

300
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
All right.

301
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
This is fine.

302
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
And I don't remember any of the songs.

303
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,880
And there's the one that's about Street Fighter and there's maybe a Castlevania one.

304
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Yeah.

305
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I don't remember any of the specific songs, but I vaguely recall one I think about Final

306
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Fantasy seven or Metal Gear Solid.

307
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Maybe it was a mixture of all those games and one song.

308
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Oh, there's, there's one that just, there's one that just like goes from like game to

309
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
game to game.

310
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Right.

311
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:34,880
It's just like a bunch of, you know, it's weird, but I have trouble these days enjoying

312
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
gaming content.

313
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm not really, I'm just not into gaming based content on YouTube as much anymore.

314
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I am, I think I could listen to, I have an endless appetite for long videos of some guy

315
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,880
explaining why Sonic Adventure 2 is good.

316
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Specifically that one game.

317
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
That sounds, and I've never even played it.

318
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I don't know why.

319
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Sounds kind of like Cyber Shell.

320
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Um, I mean, yeah, he, he, yeah, but he's like, he's, I mean, he's far from the only one.

321
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,880
There's a whole cottage industry of video, long videos where some guy explains why Sonic

322
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Adventure 2 is a good video.

323
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
I didn't realize that was such a big industry.

324
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
It is.

325
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
There's, um, maybe I should make one.

326
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I don't know.

327
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
King K had one.

328
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Running, Running Shine did one.

329
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
The Cyber Shell did one.

330
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I've heard of King K, I think.

331
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
King K's fine.

332
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
He's fine.

333
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Um, he's the guy, he's the guy he's always like, and I certainly hope you have some well-deserved

334
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
fun today.

335
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Well, that's nice of him.

336
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,880
At the end of every, at the end of every Krug Smash video, Krug, Krug Smash ends his,

337
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,880
his videos with, until next time, you bearded bastards.

338
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
And then he, and he whistles and I can't whistle.

339
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
But their voices are like kind of the same tone.

340
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,880
So sometimes he'll say that sometimes I think he'll gonna say, uh, until next time you bearded

341
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
bastards, I certainly hope you have some well-deserved fun today.

342
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Whip, whistle.

343
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Uh, and he never does it.

344
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Uh, he never does.

345
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Uh, it's fucked up.

346
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Well, um, uh, I had a, it's kind of weird how I have such a disdain for gaming content

347
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:40,880
nowadays online, considering, um, you know, I'm, uh, running a gaming thing.

348
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Yeah.

349
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
But, um.

350
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Well, I mean, I don't read comics or anything.

351
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
And I guess I like make them or something.

352
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
I used to, I don't know.

353
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
I guess we have a lot in common.

354
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Yeah.

355
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
I just hate art.

356
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I hate all human endeavor, actually.

357
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Yeah, same.

358
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Well, you can just drop endeavor and just leave human.

359
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Yeah, that too.

360
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Sure.

361
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
It's different.

362
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
No, humans are good.

363
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
No, no, I like humans.

364
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
No, no, no.

365
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm a pro human.

366
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm a pro human, but I just wish they would stop doing, doing things.

367
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,880
You're a little bit more optimistic than I am.

368
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,880
If they would just quit doing shit, everything would be fine.

369
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Uh, it looks like, it looks like Cheesy is trying to join.

370
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
I don't know if he's going to join.

371
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I guess they'll just join late.

372
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
It's fine.

373
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I'm fine with whatever.

374
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
We should, we should, we'll let, we'll let them in.

375
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
It's fine.

376
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,880
It's, uh, it's your boat that you're running on here.

377
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
It is my boat.

378
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
It's my boat.

379
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:55,880
And, and what I, and what I say goes, um, man, what did I do?

380
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,880
I just, I just listened to, no, I fucking watched gaming content.

381
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,880
The other day I was watching, uh, I watched a bunch of Jim Sterling and I made myself

382
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,880
sad thinking about what if Jim Sterling died like total biscuit.

383
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Well, I used to watch a Jim Sterling occasionally in the past and, uh, I think it's pretty good.

384
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Uh, I guess.

385
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
I don't know what he does.

386
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I really like him a lot.

387
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
I really like him a lot.

388
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
I just like people with British accents.

389
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah.

390
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I mean, I get that.

391
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I try, I try not to let it, I try not to let it persuade me.

392
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
I'm also a big fan of Yahtzee.

393
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Jim doesn't really have like a smart British accent.

394
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Jim has like a dumb British accent.

395
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Uh, so it doesn't count.

396
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Uh, cheesy welcome.

397
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,880
You've, you've, you, you, you arrived here.

398
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm fucking here.

399
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh my God.

400
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
You're on a pro crass news podcast.

401
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah.

402
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I was running, I woke up late in my hotel bed, um, cause I showed up to New England and

403
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,880
then my taxi was running late and I showed up to the PCP HQ building.

404
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,880
There's, there's security guard out in the front and he was, he was hassling me.

405
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm like, no, I'm a guest on today's episode and he's like, I have no idea what the fuck

406
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
you're talking about.

407
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
It was a, it was a whole ordeal.

408
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
I left my, I left my VIP pass in my other clown pants.

409
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Yeah.

410
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Yeah.

411
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
No, I left it back at the hotel and then when I drive back and I call Ben and I interrupted

412
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,880
him while they were recording another episode and he had to come down and explain to the

413
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,880
security guard for me to be let inside the building.

414
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,880
It was fucking, it was fucking ordeal.

415
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
No benefits.

416
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Clown.

417
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Well, two hyenas were eating a clown and one says to the other, does this taste funny to

418
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
you?

419
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Oh my God.

420
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Cheesy.

421
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Yeah.

422
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Your response?

423
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Um, my response are the, is one of the clowns like a, is one of the hyenas a female?

424
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Uh, possibly.

425
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Okay.

426
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Well, she, um, she grows her giant hyena penis and she says, shut the fuck up bitch.

427
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
And it fucks him.

428
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Yeah.

429
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Which is very, which is very accurate to hyena.

430
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,880
You know, hyena, you know, hyena biology, uh, gamer tavern.

431
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Uh, not really.

432
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Uh, the female hyena like in growth, like her clitoris grows massive, like the size of

433
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
a penis.

434
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
She knots him.

435
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Yeah.

436
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
She knots him.

437
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh yeah.

438
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
I think I have heard of this from somewhere.

439
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm not sure why.

440
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Yeah.

441
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
It's, it's kind of crazy.

442
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
I wish humans could do that.

443
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
It's kind of based.

444
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Like really get right.

445
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,380
It's kind of unfair that God gave like animals all the cool dicks and we got, we got the

446
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
lame dicks.

447
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,880
We know human dick is pretty fucking sick.

448
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,880
No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stick my neck out for human dick.

449
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't know.

450
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Cheesy.

451
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Have you ever tried a human dick?

452
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
It kind of, it kind of changes your world.

453
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,880
And you know, the best, the best human dick circumcised baby.

454
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Whoa.

455
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
See, this is why I was brought on.

456
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,880
This is why I brought on because I am the elusive, uncircumcised guest.

457
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Finally, I am here, right?

458
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Fuck off.

459
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
No, wait, we don't.

460
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Okay.

461
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Here's the thing.

462
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I didn't really want to argue about this.

463
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
I'll just say one fucking Gentile.

464
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I'll just say one statement.

465
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
I just want to make one statement.

466
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
All right.

467
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Okay.

468
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
All right.

469
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
So, so it's, it's no, it's no rumor.

470
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Ben, Ben circumcised confirmed, right?

471
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Sad but true.

472
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Sad but true.

473
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Right.

474
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Um, but, and Ben circumcised, um, there's only two vapors books.

475
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Hmm.

476
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Cheesy, uncircumcised, there's a, there's four chapters of villain verse.

477
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
What?

478
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
That's crazy.

479
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Numbers don't lie.

480
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
That's just not right.

481
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Yeah, exactly.

482
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Like, um, yeah, in my foreskin, that's where I keep the extra chapters of villain verse.

483
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Did I forget to buy chapter three?

484
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I don't know.

485
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
And four.

486
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I don't know.

487
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Um, something.

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
You got one and two.

489
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Uh, four is not out yet, actually.

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
It's going to be.

491
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay.

492
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I may have forgotten to buy number three.

493
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Hopefully it's out by today.

494
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Actually, wait, you're a patron.

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
So you get a number three for free.

496

Yeah.

You're a patron of my Patreon.

I'm pretty sure.

500
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
That's, that's fucking epic.

501
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Yeah.

502
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
If you go to fucking epic.

503
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,880
If you go to my Patreon is probably one of the last or third posts.

504
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,880
The only thing I post on the Patreon anymore is a villain verse chapters.

505
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880

Uh, yes.

This will be coming out on Friday.

510
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,880
And it would also be the last day to pre-order your own physical copy of villain verse.

You get your own.

517
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Shouldn't we try to explain who the guest is to the viewers in case somebody doesn't know?

518
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Um, oh, um, yeah, we should probably that's smart.

519
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
That's smart.

520
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,880
I guess I just assumed that people know cheesy cheesy Manfredo is, uh, is, uh, the cloud is

521
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
a clown.

522
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Uh-huh.

523
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
That is me.

524
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
I am the one more.

525
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
What more is there to say?

526
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Um, I've been, uh, I've been Pete.

527
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm, I'm what the cool kids like to call PCP adjacent.

528
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Right.

529
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
So there's, yeah.

530
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Yeah.

531
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,880
And author and author of, and author of monkey Jones favorite webcomic, uh, Bongo and Luna.

532
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Bongo.

533
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Yeah.

534
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Monkey Jones did say when monkey Jones and, uh, I think he interviewed, uh, Pickle.

535
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Rhee.

536
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
You guys remember Pickle.

537
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Rhee.

538
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
God.

539
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Of course.

540
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
That was like three years ago.

541
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Um, on that video, we interviewed Pickle.

542
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Rhee at the end.

543
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
He expresses his love of Bongo and Luna.

544
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,880
I, I totally did not pay him, uh, 15 bucks to say that.

545
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
I did.

546
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
I did not do that.

547
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
And the notion is, yeah.

548
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
What kind of asshole like markets their comic with money?

549
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I've, I can't.

550
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
I don't know anyone who does that.

551
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Yeah.

552
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Yeah.

553
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Let me like a piece of shit, dude.

554
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Agreed.

555
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
A real, a real artist.

556
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,880
A real artist is on Twitter talking about how much depression they have and how much.

557
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh, I wish I could make a comic.

558
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
I'm so depressed.

559
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
That's it.

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
That's how you really market your webcomic.

561
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
That's the best way.

562
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Cause it, cause it's related.

563
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
It's related.

564
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Yeah.

565
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Exactly.

566
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Well, this person has depression.

567
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
I'm going to check out their comic.

568
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Oh, wait.

569
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
They don't got one.

570
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
This person's just like me.

571
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
They suck.

572
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Let me see what they make.

573
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
I am, um, hot take.

574
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
I don't have depression.

575
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,880
So it's, it's kind of a struggle for me to promote my webcomic.

576
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
That's fucked up.

577
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Yeah.

578
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
I can't relate to the masses.

579
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Wait, you don't?

580
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
That's weird.

581
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Yeah.

582
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,880
I was, I was born, I was born different, if you will.

583
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Um, uncircumcised, if you will.

584
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
And I think that probably like affected me not having depression.

585
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
It's crazy.

586
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Yeah.

587
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
That's a good point.

588
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Yeah.

589
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Exactly.

590
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I was, I, unfortunately, tragically, I was born depressed,

591
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
circumcised and vaccinated.

592
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,880
So, you know, the deck was stacked.

593
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,880
The deck was, it was a hat trick.

594
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Well, I'm not perfect either.

595
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
I'm vaccinated as well.

596
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
So, you know, not everyone's perfect.

597
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Then it's okay.

598
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
I'm still, I'm no God.

599
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Ben, I am human as you too.

600
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,880
I mean, if it helps, I was born, I was born brown in America.

601
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
And that's kind of like how cute.

602
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
That's like kind of having a deep, a deep up in America.

603
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
You know, if you're straight and white, that's like a might as well.

604
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,880
You're like, um, what would be a perfect word?

605
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
You're already like ahead of us.

606
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Like a, you know, you're like, um, it's like, that's like your,

607
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,880
that's like you got the world of Warcraft, uh, uh, like a demo pack

608
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,880
and they give you like the XP boosts, you know, so you level up faster.

609
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

610
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
You know, the first 20 levels like that.

611
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Yes.

612
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
You get those first 20 levels for free.

613
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Straight white boys get that bonus XP pack.

614
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,880
But if they turn trans, um, because the wow hates trans people,

615
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
they're like, ooh, yeah, sorry.

616
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
We're going to take those back, my guy.

617
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Fun fact.

618
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,880
You know, it's just, uh, it's just, uh, it's just the way the world, you know,

619
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
where there's nothing, nothing for it.

620
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,880
It's just, it's just, uh, immutable law of the universe.

621
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I think I was also easy come easy go.

622
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,880
I was also brought on this episode to kind of balance it out from last episode.

623
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Because, um, you guys, you guys have like a Nazi as a guest in the last episode.

624
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,880
And then out there in PCPHQ, they were like, oh, now we got to bring a lefty,

625
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
you know, to balance it out.

626
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
And I'm very, I'm very left.

627
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Fringe, fringe.

628
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,880
At least, um, nobody can accuse you of having an echo chamber now.

629
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Exactly. Exactly.

630
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
I'm the opposite of echo chamber.

631
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,880
I purposely try to like make tweets that piss off people.

632
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
So I get a bunch of like people shitting on me.

633
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Right.

634
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
And I'm like, finally different opinions.

635
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,880
This podcast is already communist propaganda.

636
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
True. True that.

637
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
That's just, that's just the way I like it.

638
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
You're welcome.

639
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,880
I mean, in the previous episode, you apparently had somebody who wasn't a communist.

640
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Well, you can't, well, you can't win.

641
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Well, Ben brought him on.

642
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,880
And if you have seen, if you've seen the last episode, you don't have to watch it.

643
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
I'll run it down for you.

644
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Ben had an epic debate against murder logic and he explained to him why he should stop

645
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
being a Nazi.

646
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
He should stop being a right winger.

647
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,880
He explained to him why, why the Mr. Medeker conspiracy theory is fake and he shouldn't

648
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
believe Mr. Medeker and then murder luck.

649
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Yeah.

650
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
There's a calm and reasonable discussion about it.

651
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,880
We all, we all, we all coolly, you know, we, without prejudice laid out the facts on

652
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,880
the table and examined them thoroughly and came, and came to the only logical.

653
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
It sounds amazing.

654
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I should have, I should have listened to it.

655
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah.

656
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
And then murder logic is like, Ben, you're right.

657
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,880
For now on, I'm only commissioning POC women feeding the, feeding the poor.

658
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
That's my fetish now.

659
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
No.

660
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,880
POC women feeding the poor.

661
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,880
He, he, he wouldn't like, he wouldn't like that because.

662
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,880
No, but you convinced them because you, you explained, he convinced him to stop being

663
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
a Nazi and he's like, you're right, Ben.

664
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
And then his fetish were, went in reverse.

665
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Oh, okay.

666
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Okay.

667
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Good.

668
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Yeah.

669
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
All right.

670
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
It's like opposite land.

671
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,380
The only thing I know about him is the Wonder Bread stuff.

672
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,880
I don't know anything else about him outside of that.

673
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,880
He didn't, he didn't really, he didn't really go into, he didn't really go into like things.

674
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,880
He'd just say, what if one thing he would say every now and then would give a pretty,

675
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
he's like, okay, I see where this goes.

676
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,880
If you're a high bread tube consumer like me, if you're a big brain breadtuber.

677
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
You can see the signs.

678
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Consumer.

679
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Yeah.

680
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
You can catch what we in the industry like to call dog whistles.

681
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
You can smell it.

682
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Yeah.

683
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
You can smell it on him.

684
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,880
God, while I was watching that episode, like the way he talked, I was thinking like, he

685
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
sounds like a dick show guest.

686
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Like he has that cadence to it.

687
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
I mean, he, he literally was that.

688
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Right.

689
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
I mean, I, I think I guessed that before you said that he was.

690
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
And I'm like, oh my God, this is crazy.

691
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,880
I think someone in the comments called it the white libertarian voice.

692
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Yes.

693
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
And you know what?

694
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I can think of, I can think of at least one other person who has the same voice.

695
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
And yeah, that's what it is.

696
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
That's what it is.

697
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I think that's where I first learned of him.

698
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,880
I, I, um, I listened to a clip of him on the dick show, I think.

699
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Because I don't, I don't listen to the dick show, but sometimes I, I watched the clips.

700
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,880
And I thought, wow, this guy is weird.

701
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Yeah.

702
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
It is the internet.

703
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
He's weird and he's pretty annoying.

704
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,880
I'm not, I'm not surprised he exists.

705
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm not.

706
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
No.

707
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
All right.

708
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,880
But, um, he's, um, he's a, he's a white kid dude.

709
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Um, shout out to Murilogic.

710
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Murilogic, it's capitalism.

711
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
That's the problem.

712
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Shout out to Murilogic.

713
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Murilogic, we'll have you back on the show anytime.

714
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Murilogic, we love you.

715
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Thanks for coming on the show.

716
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,880
You, you brightened our lives and our hearts.

717
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,880
I think it's, it's cool to have weird guests on every once in a while.

718
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I agree.

719
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
I agree.

720
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Honestly, honestly, like, like the people complain, like, like the people complaining in the comments,

721
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,880
like, I understand not liking Murilogic, but I don't see why that's a bad thing.

722
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Like, why is, other than the fact that his story was really long anyway.

723
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
That's how, that's how you tell shows.

724
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
That's how you tell stories on a dick show.

725
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
You got to tell them longer than they actually are.

726
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Hey guys, what's going on?

727
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Give and take.

728
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
There she is.

729
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Are you recording?

730
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Yeah.

731
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Based.

732
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
How long have you been going?

733
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
40 minutes.

734
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh, no problem.

735
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Crazy.

736
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Crazy.

737
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,880
I was just, I was just busy with a little thing called shirking my responsibilities and not looking at anything at all.

738
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,880
You didn't tell, you didn't tell Cheesy when we record.

739
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I was going to do that.

740
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Well, when?

741
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Well, you know.

742
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
You know, after the episode was over.

743
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
No.

744
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Nice.

745
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Before the episode, look, I just didn't turn on my computer all day and I was having fun with family.

746
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,880
So that's my bad.

747
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Frankly, that's despicable.

748
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Step first mistake you live with your family.

749
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
That's a no-no.

750
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
It's the holidays.

751
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
It's the December time.

752
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Wow.

753
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Fucking Europeans.

754
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Fucking Europeans all living with family.

755
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,880
You should be like Americans and bootstrap your ways out into a house with like seven other dudes that you've never met before.

756
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Unironically, that is, I'm literally living in a house with seven other dudes right now.

757
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Good.

758
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
You know what?

759
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Good.

760
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm living the Ben St. lifestyle.

761
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
It's nice except.

762
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
It's going to be kind of a full house.

763
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,880
It's nice except when I decide that I want some fried chicken at one in the morning and I tenderize the meat in the kitchen

764
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,880
and it's so loud that it wakes people up and they all yell at me.

765
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
You know, except for that, it's good.

766
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
I mean.

767
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
It's good, I promise.

768
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
That's every house.

769
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Unless you're completely alone.

770
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Yeah.

771
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Well, you know what?

772
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Fuck I'm Ben.

773
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
You know, you want some fried chicken?

774
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,880
All the fried chicken places are closed at one.

775
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
How are you going to get fried chicken?

776
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
You got to make it, you know?

777
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
You got to make it.

778
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Yeah, exactly.

779
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
And God forbid it not be tenderized.

780
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Yeah.

781
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,880
The Chad mood move is to just make the fried chicken and wake everybody up.

782
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Fuck them.

783
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Yeah.

784
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
That's exactly what I did.

785
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
I got to get all those gains.

786
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
And it was delicious.

787
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Exactly.

788
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
You say gave or Tavern knows.

789
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Yeah.

790
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,880
You know, it's about gains.

791
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I haven't worked out in a week.

792
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
I'm such a fucking idiot.

793
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm losing my gains actually.

794
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I don't work out.

795
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I'm going for it.

796
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
I had started working out.

797
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I was doing pretty good, but I've fallen.

798
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
I've slipped.

799
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I've slipped a little bit.

800
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
I haven't worked out this week.

801
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
It's bad.

802
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I got to get back on it.

803
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
What do you usually do?

804
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Where you work out, Regiment?

805
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Squat.

806
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
A squat and just, it's just been squatting and benching.

807
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Squat.

808
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Is your, is your, is your ass thick now?

809
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Is it, is it big?

810
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Is it, is it a big ass?

811
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
No.

812
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
It's normal.

813
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Damn.

814
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
That sucks.

815
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
It's normal.

816
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
It's, it's.

817
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,880
It may come as a surprise, but I actually work out almost every single day now.

818
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Nice.

819
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
What do you do?

820
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
What's your routine?

821
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Everything.

822
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
I've got a schedule.

823
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I do just 24 seven, just all muscles clenched all the time.

824
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,880
He's running right now as he's recording this podcast.

825
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:01,880
I wish, but I do like one day arms, one day legs, one day shoulders, you know, that kind

826
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
of thing.

827
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Nice.

828
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Do you do it in a gym?

829
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,880
I used to, but now, you know, because of COVID, I've been doing it at home.

830
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,880
I have a bunch of weights and stuff at home.

831
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
He's been doing it back at the tavern as his name implies.

832
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Back of it.

833
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Yeah, exactly.

834
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Yeah.

835
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I was working out sort of quite consistently a while ago, but I stopped and then just continued

836
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
to stop.

837
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Remember when Mary called you, remember when Mary called you a bitch boy?

838
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Whoa, what the fuck?

839
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
That was something like that.

840
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Yeah.

841
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
That was literally epic.

842
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Whoa.

843
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
That was a world conjecture.

844
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
They didn't have any evidence to support their claims.

845
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
They didn't.

846
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
And they need evidence.

847
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Yeah.

848
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
What was his marriage?

849
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
No, he's not real.

850
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
He's a Vtuber.

851
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
That's right.

852
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
They're not.

853
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
They're not human.

854
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I don't consider them human.

855
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
No.

856
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Danes neither.

857
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Oh, exactly.

858
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Especially the Danish.

859
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
Wait.

860
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Is he Danish or is he Finnish?

861
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
He's Danish.

862
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
He's Finnish when I'm done with him.

863
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
That's right.

864
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
He's gonna make that joke.

865
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Okay.

866
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
All right.

867
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
So I've come in late.

868
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
What have you already talked about?

869
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,880
We talked about, we talked about Game Grumps for a while.

870
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,880
We talked about gaming content on YouTube in general and how gamers have been

871
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
sick of it.

872
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,880
We talked about Villainverse and Bongo and Luna a little bit.

873
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,880
We talked about Circumstition, obviously.

874
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I want to talk a bit about Bongo and the cheesy verse.

875
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Oh, yeah.

876
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
What cheesy has been.

877
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,880
Because I've been following you on a few things and you have been pumping out

878
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Villainverse pages and chapters.

879
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Oh, yeah.

880
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
And it's quite impressive.

881
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Incredible, in fact.

882
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Thank you.

883
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I appreciate it.

884
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Yeah.

885
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,880
So I guess people don't know me for the cheesy and the PCP lore goes way back when I made

886
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,880
a call that was made a voice call to the PCP where I was actually secretly shilling Bongo

887
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,880
over the whole time and Ben figured out dead, dead away.

888
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,880
And then I made another one because Ben recognized real.

889
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
He knows when someone's shilling.

890
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Game recognizes games.

891
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Exactly, right?

892
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Like he saw that.

893
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
He's all like this mother.

894
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Have you ever seen the ending of Nightcrawler?

895
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
No.

896
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,880
It's literally the ending of Nightcrawler.

897
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm the Mexican within the car accident with the gun and Ben saying is a Jake Gyllenhaal

898
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,880
and it looks like I'm going to shoot a Ben say Jake Gyllenhaal, but I don't because I

899
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
recognize him as a psychopath just like me.

900
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,880
So, so basically after I pulled myself out of that car accident, I invited Ben onto my

901
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
podcast cheesy cast.

902
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
That was fun.

903
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
You should check that out.

904
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,880
It's the first episode of cheesy cast with Ben saying and it's kind of it's actually probably

905
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
perfect to watch it now because we're at the end of that podcast.

906
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Ben says everything he's going to do up to this point.

907
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Right.

908
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,880
So it's a good it's a good way to check to see if Ben went out and did all his promises.

909
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Oh God, I probably did.

910
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
It was a good way to get tabs on him.

911
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Yeah, you had tabs on Ben because he won't do it himself.

912
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,880
I can't I can't believe you got Ivy Adams on the cheesy cast.

913
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
That's so cool.

914
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,880
Oh yeah, that was extremely because I was talking to another Ivy Adams is the creator of a

915
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
comic called Pinky and Pepper.

916
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Actually, you might like that.

917
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
I'll send you a I'll send you a link to it.

918
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I bet you would like Pinky and Pepper.

919
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Ivy Adams is so fucking cool.

920
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
Yeah, I love I love Ivy Adams.

921
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
She's a she's a cool person.

922
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
And um, no, she was really easy because I was talking to another friend of mine.

923
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I was saying like, yeah, I'm going to email her right now and she's all like just DM her

924
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,880
and I'm like, what is like, yeah, if you DM her, she replies to anybody.

925
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,880
And then she showed me a screenshot of them just DMing them like a random thing and she

926
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
just replies.

927
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
And I'm like, oh, okay.

928
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
So I just yeah, I just DM there and it was it took a minute because she doesn't like

929
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
clowns.

930
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I'm at this point.

931
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
I'm like, at this point.

932
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Yeah, it's a struggle.

933
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
It's a handicap.

934
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
I got to live with, you know.

935
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Yeah.

936
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,880
Furries their handicap, you know, a lot of people don't like furries.

937
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm the same, you know, like I got the clown thing.

938
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,880
A lot of people don't like clowns, but getting up, but getting Ivy after moving past that

939
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
getting out was really cool.

940
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:27,880
But anyway, so at that point, I think I stopped doing bongo and Luna, which was like my slice

941
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,880
of life fetish comic on webtoon.

942
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,880
And yeah, it was pretty, it wasn't that fetish.

943
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,880
It's about it's not that fetishy.

944
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,880
It's like it's monster girls and clowns and there's some there's some kind of lewd humor

945
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
or some crude humor, I guess.

946
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
Yeah, it's a lot like it's not like a horny comic.

947
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,880
It's not too horny.

948
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,880
It's like it's kind of like it has there's a certain there's a dynamic.

949
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,880
So bongo is like the mature one and like Luna is like the horny one.

950
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
And that's basically the dynamic.

951
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,880
That's like the backbone of the whole series.

952
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Right.

953
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
If you ever seen a, you ever seen a key and peel?

954
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,880
I mean, it's just a little bit.

955
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,880
I mean, besides can feel, I mean, like, have you ever just any like routine any comedy

956
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
bit?

957
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,880
There's always like the serious guy and the silly guy, you know, like that's a

958
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Yeah, exactly.

959
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
That's cool.

960
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
That's called, I believe.

961
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
Not.

962
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Yes, exactly.

963
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
Classic.

964
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Yeah.

965
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
So that's basically bongo and Luna.

966
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Right.

967
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
And it wasn't making me that much money.

968
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
No.

969
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Because there's no money in comics.

970
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
That's unironically true.

971
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
Don't do, don't do comics if you want to make money.

972
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,880
If that's like your first goal, you're fucked.

973
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Unless you're like Mary, whether it's just, it was just, um, it was just fucking wild.

974
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
It was just crazy.

975
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,880
It was off the chain and doing anything online unless you're super popular.

976
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
True.

977
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Mary wither just has a compulsion to Mary withers brain is just wired so that he is

978
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:07,880
like, I think he just genuinely loves like, uh, uh, uh, like, Hey, what if this meme was

979
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
an anime girl?

980
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
Like, I think that's just what he likes.

981
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,880
This is a bread and butter.

982
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,880
And it just happens to be what like, it just happens to be like the perfect, like lowest

983
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
common denominator.

984
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Like everybody can, can appreciate the appeal of it.

985
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,880
The most marketable thing in the universe.

986
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
I am.

987
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,880
I see him when I, when it was on the podcast, um, he said, like, like, I wanted to get him

988
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
on my podcast at one point, right?

989
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,880
But that, that hasn't happened because he hasn't accepted my friend request on discord.

990
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
I told him to.

991
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,880
Yeah.

992
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Yeah.

993
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,880
I know.

994
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
And he said, and he said he would, he said he would.

995
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
Uh, it's been like months.

996
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
I guess it has.

997
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,880
Um, no, you should, you should just make a group chat and just add me into it or whatever.

998
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,880
Um, but anyway, it's just that I think, I think what's lucky about Mary wither is that

999
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,880
he had like the money to back him up to just get the first one done.

1000
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,880
And he just had to kind of like, there's a certain, it takes an amount of, uh,

1001
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
I started up capital startup capital and also some balls to do what he did because he,

1002
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,880
like how he said, like, oh, I basically just like DM like over 200 artists and see who would buy.

1003
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Right.

1004
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Yeah.

1005
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
Cause that's a, that's, that's crazy.

1006
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Cause I mean, that's like, I mean, logically, eventually someone's going to take the bay.

1007
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Right.

1008
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,880
And, um, yeah, I think another thing with Mary weather is that I think he unironically likes

1009
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
all that stuff.

1010
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Um, yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying.

1011
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,880
Like that's, that's what he likes.

1012
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Yeah.

1013
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,880
He's incredibly marketable.

1014
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,880
He, um, he, I watch another interview with him that web tunes did, um, because there

1015
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
was a couple of questions you guys didn't ask him.

1016
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,880
And I was still like, and I was like, Oh, ask him these questions for my podcast.

1017
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,880
But then I find that he answered these, uh, questions on other interviews.

1018
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
And one of them, he said, like, someone asked him, where do you get your ideas from?

1019
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,880
And then he said that he literally watches the first episode of every seasonal anime.

1020
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,880
And then he just takes con, he just takes concepts.

1021
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
And he's like, Oh, I can explore this concept.

1022
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,880
And I'm like, that explains so much because all of this stuff just feels like seasonal

1023
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
anime.

1024
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,880
That's so funny.

1025
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Yeah.

1026
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
Yeah.

1027
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
It's, it's crazy.

1028
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,880
And usually comes some of the, you usually need something for inspiration.

1029
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,880
Almost all ideas have an origin.

1030
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Yeah.

1031
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
Yeah.

1032
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,880
I mean, I agree.

1033
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
I do that too.

1034
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
When I like watch movies and I'm like, Oh, this is a cool concept.

1035
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,880
I wish this was like expanded on or I'll just expand it like, you know, fan fiction

1036
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,880
or something.

1037
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,880
Speaking of stealing concepts, we got to talk about villain verse now.

1038
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,880
And, um, I guess, uh, what's, uh, what should I explain here?

1039
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Should one of you guys try to explain it?

1040
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,880
See what the violence?

1041
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,880
Yeah.

1042
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,880
I think I've only read the first issue.

1043
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Yeah.

1044
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,880
Did you read the prologue and chapter one?

1045
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
I read the prologue and chapter one.

1046
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,880
Yeah.

1047
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,880
So there's this goblin guy with the big tusks.

1048
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah.

1049
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,880
He's the big bad guy.

1050
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,880
He's like, um, uh, I'm the number one villain as is ranked on this thing.

1051
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,880
I forget if he made the thing.

1052
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Yeah.

1053
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
He made it.

1054
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,880
It's like this giant ethereal list that just exists on the end of the, at the edge of the

1055
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
universe.

1056
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,880
And the names on it just keep shifting because like depending how evil you are, you move down

1057
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
on the rank or whatnot.

1058
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Or if you just straight up die, you disappear from the list.

1059
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
Right.

1060
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,880
So it's, it's for like a bragging rights competition to see who can be the most evil and dastardly

1061
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,880
devilish person on the list.

1062
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
Yeah.

1063
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
Yeah.

1064
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
That's right.

1065
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,880
That's right.

1066
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Yeah.

1067
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
That's, uh, that's like the backbone of the series.

1068
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,880
It's, it's really, uh, if you read the prologue, it's, it starts mostly as a feud between like

1069
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,880
the character give just explained.

1070
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,880
His name is the villain.

1071
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,880
Like that's his name.

1072
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,880
Right.

1073
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,880
And he has this feud with the devil, like the literal devil is like a character in this

1074
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,880
universe.

1075
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,880
Uh, and they're trying to compete to see who's the most evil.

1076
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,880
Yes.

1077
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:08,880
And throughout the story, like the villain has this very over elaborate 4d, like death note

1078
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,880
Kira style plan that we're going to see him like pull off.

1079
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
Right.

1080
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,880
And I, and I know exactly how it's going to end.

1081
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,880
I guess the only spoiler I could give about how it's going to end, it's going to parallel

1082
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,880
the, the prologue in chapter one, like a lot.

1083
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Right.

1084
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Like a book ending.

1085
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Right.

1086
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Um, I'm a big fan of those.

1087
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Some books.

1088
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,880
No, I don't read that shit.

1089
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
I don't read that shit.

1090
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Does that mean you're a prologue?

1091
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Yeah.

1092
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
I'm a prologue.

1093
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,880
I guess like trees and shit.

1094
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Yeah.

1095
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,880
I have trees like weed.

1096
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Yeah.

1097
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Exactly.

1098
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Yeah.

1099
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Yeah.

1100
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
We smoke weed.

1101
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,880
If you cut down trees, it's basically a comic about smoking weed.

1102
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
Exactly.

1103
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
It's a metaphor for smoking weed.

1104
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,880
It's like everyone's competing to see how much jaywalking they can do in one second.

1105
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
Exactly.

1106
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,880
That's why the villain is green.

1107
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,880
It's a parable as weed will kill you.

1108
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
His head is in the shape of a weed leaf.

1109
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
You're right.

1110
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
It's a, it makes perfect sense.

1111
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
I knew it.

1112
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
I knew it.

1113
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
Yeah.

1114
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
I knew it.

1115
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Yeah.

1116
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,880
That's what jaywalking you got to do, but it's not enough.

1117
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Like, it's not enough that you jaywalk on your own planet.

1118
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,880
You have to move from planet to planet and jaywalk on other planets, other solar systems,

1119
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,880
until you just jaywalk so much that you rise above the ranks.

1120
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,880
I don't, I don't see why jaywalking is illegal.

1121
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Doesn't jay deserve to walk too?

1122
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
Mike doesn't let him.

1123
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,880
Mike stochasta says, no, Jerry, stop jaywalking.

1124
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,880
That's why he was in that wheelchair.

1125
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,880
That's why he was in that wheelchair in that one episode.

1126
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Yeah, exactly.

1127
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
He fucking jaywalking before he got hit.

1128
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Like, fuck you jay, I'll jaywalk as much as they want.

1129
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Some crazy Milwaukee like driver hit him.

1130
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
Milwaukee jaywalking.

1131
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Oh my, it rhymes.

1132
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
It's like poetry.

1133
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
Here's the rabbit hole go.

1134
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,880
It's like poetry arrives.

1135
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,880
So what else about villain verse?

1136
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
Oh yeah.

1137
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,880
And I'll just tell you how it ends right now.

1138
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
I'll tell you what the final spoiler.

1139
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,880
All right.

1140
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,880
So, so at the end, the villain turns to the camera.

1141
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Yeah.

1142
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,880
At the end, the villain like turns to the camera and he says like,

1143
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,880
but the real villain is capitalism.

1144
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
That's a good one.

1145
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,880
Very clever.

1146
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
Yeah.

1147
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,880
It's a real thinker.

1148
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,880
It's a really nuanced, very subtle.

1149
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,880
He blow, he blows the dust off that off the list to reveal that

1150
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,880
capitalism was actually at the top the whole time.

1151
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Like, yeah, he, it's capitalism.

1152
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,880
The villain, then the devil, right?

1153
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
Makes you, makes you think.

1154
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,880
Yeah, exactly.

1155
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,880
It's supposed to make you think.

1156
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,880
Actually, there is kind of a message in villain verse,

1157
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,880
but it's not really revealed to like the last chapter.

1158
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,880
I, it's, I believe it's going to be more subtle.

1159
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
Like I have faith in my writing.

1160
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,880
I think I'm a good writer.

1161
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
I think.

1162
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
But yeah, you should check out villain verse.

1163
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,880
It's about a bunch of crazy wacky space villains all trying to

1164
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
murder each other.

1165
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,880
Meanwhile, the big bad space villain has like an elaborate plan

1166
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,880
that involves just like wiping everybody out in a specific way

1167
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
that you're going to see at the end.

1168
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
And there's a,

1169
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,880
I gotta get, I gotta get chapter three.

1170
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
I forgot to buy chapter three.

1171
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Yeah.

1172
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Yeah.

1173
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
You should, you should, you should, um, yeah,

1174
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
you guys should tell me what you think of chapter three.

1175
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,880
I like to hear people's feedback on each chapter.

1176
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
I forget.

1177
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
I, I, I supported your Indiegogo.

1178
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,880
I figured which, which things did I get from that?

1179
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Oh, you, I think I did.

1180
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,880
You got, I, you wanted a picture of Clarissa, but thick.

1181
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Yeah.

1182
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,880
Yeah.

1183
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
I got that.

1184
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Yeah.

1185
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
So I, um, I drew thick Clarissa.

1186
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,880
Um, it's, it's one of the things you could have gotten because,

1187
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,880
um, a couple of months ago,

1188
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,880
my computer was finally showing its age.

1189
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,880
And, um, I needed like, uh, I need a new one.

1190
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,880
I'm like, I can't finish villain versus without like a new computer.

1191
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,880
So, um, I ran a little Indiegogo for it.

1192
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
No, it'll go fund me.

1193
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
Yeah.

1194
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
I ran a go fund me for it.

1195
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
I had to get a new one.

1196
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,880
Now I got this brick of a gamer PC.

1197
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Um, I'll play video games, but, um, yeah, and I got that,

1198
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,880
I got that bullshit.

1199
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
Oh, that's nice.

1200
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,880
I need to get a new tablet.

1201
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Yeah.

1202
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
Tablet broke and I need a new one.

1203
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,880
Ah, I just keep not getting one.

1204
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,880
Um, it is, it is time to get a new tablet.

1205
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,880
I would argue.

1206
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
Yes.

1207
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,880
Yeah.

1208
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Sad.

1209
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Yeah.

1210
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,880
I just realized, uh, this is the first episode that I and Gib have been on in a while together.

1211
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,880
Oh, that's true.

1212
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Last time you were on, I wasn't for some reason.

1213
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
That's weird.

1214
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,880
Why was I, what did I do?

1215
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Why was I?

1216
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,880
Did, did Gabriel Tavern scare you off?

1217
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,880
Yes.

1218
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
I was terrified.

1219
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,880
I think maybe, um, it's better for only one of us to be on at a time because with two

1220
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,880
of us is just too many puns.

1221
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,880
Exactly.

1222
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1223
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
You can't say that now.

1224
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,880
I'll have pressure to do puns on my end.

1225
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
I haven't got anything in my head right now.

1226
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Say it.

1227
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,880
Hey, Gib, you're a, hey, you're a funny, you're a funny person.

1228
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Why don't you tell us a joke?

1229
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
Huh?

1230
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Why don't you make us laugh?

1231
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,880
Is that internet comedian Gib?

1232
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,880
Hey, Gib, play us a classic right now, Gib.

1233
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,880
Um.

1234
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Oh, classic Gib.

1235
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
That's a good one.

1236
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
Classic Gib.

1237
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
Don't, don't laugh at me.

1238
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Oh, what is, what a joke.

1239
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
What a joke.

1240
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
No, it's so embarrassing.

1241
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,880
What an absolute joke.

1242
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,880
But doctor, but doctor, I am Gib and take.

1243
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,880
Doctor, I think I keep thinking I'm Gib and take.

1244
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
That's cause you are.

1245
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
Honk, honk.

1246
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Oh, good.

1247
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
That's what the name was on file.

1248
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,880
Oh my God.

1249
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,880
But, but doctor, I am bongo and Luna.

1250
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,880
Shut the fuck up.

1251
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
Said the doctor.

1252
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,880
44 Magnum and blust you away.

1253
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,880
The real bongo and Luna was capitalism.

1254
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,880
And unironically.

1255
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,880
So that is the message of bongo and Luna.

1256
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,880
I'm going to talk about any of my comics having messages.

1257
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,880
Um, they kind of have been by accident really.

1258
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Yeah.

1259
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,880
I was, I was, I was like the message of bell jpe.

1260
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
That you should break out of jail and that it's fun.

1261
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Yeah.

1262
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,880
Fuck the police.

1263
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Anti-authority, anti-authority.

1264
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,880
Yeah.

1265
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Punk is the ultimate anti-fur.

1266
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,880
I was, uh, I was drawing someone, uh, uh, someone requested.

1267
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Cause I'm so stupid.

1268
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,880
I had still not completed all my, uh, uh, papers, uh, doodles.

1269
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
I was doing like one of the last ones.

1270
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,880
Someone had requested that I just draw some lore shit.

1271
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Like just any lore, like new lore.

1272
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,880
And I was like, okay.

1273
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,880
And I drew some champion related stuff.

1274
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,880
And I remembered like, oh, wait a minute.

1275
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,880
Uh, this premise and the setting is actually fucking based.

1276
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,880
And, uh, it was a genius to create it.

1277
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,880
And I should probably make some more of it.

1278
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,880
Um, that's kind of really cool about this whole thing with, um, people like to think

1279
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
that, okay.

1280
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,880
So amateurs, right?

1281
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,880
Um, they like to think that you need to wait for inspiration.

1282
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,880
Like a professional knows that you just got to start working and inspiration is going to hit you.

1283
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,880
You got to just have their brain rolling, right?

1284
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,880
And I feel like, yeah, I feel like what happened to you is like evidence of that.

1285
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Right?

1286
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Yeah.

1287
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Yeah.

1288
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Um, yeah.

1289
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,880
Cause I knew what I wanted to draw and I started drawing and it just got me, it just got me

1290
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,880
thinking about like, oh yeah, you know, I'm drawn this character and thinking about like

1291
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,880
them existing in the world and like what their role is in the larger setting.

1292
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
And I'm like, oh yeah.

1293
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Oh yeah.

1294
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,880
There's themes here that there's themes.

1295
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,880
I seem to recall.

1296
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Hmm.

1297
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Pretty cool.

1298
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
Actually.

1299
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
And then they turn to the camera and they say capitalism was the problem.

1300
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
They say the real champion was.

1301
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Yeah, exactly.

1302
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Whoa, no way.

1303
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
That would blow my load.

1304
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,880
I would be like, whoa, I guess maybe I should be circumcised.

1305
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
I would have said that.

1306
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,880
Sophia turns directly to the camera and says, I have become increasingly disillusioned with

1307
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,880
the white moderate who prefers a negative, a negative piece, which is the absence of

1308
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,880
conflict to a positive piece, which is the presence of justice and so on and so forth.

1309
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,880
And then her, and then her, her little friends is like, whoa, what are you putting in?

1310
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,880
She's like X-Men 2.

1311
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
That's right.

1312
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,880
X-Men 2 is pretty, pretty good.

1313
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,880
X-Men 2 is probably the smartest movie ever made.

1314
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
Unironically.

1315
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Yeah, probably.

1316
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,880
There's a chick.

1317
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
Don't remember.

1318
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,880
There's a chick in that movie who has like sharp claws and she's like, I'm the female

1319
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
Wolverine.

1320
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,880
And then Wolverine's like, you can't be, there can't be a female Wolverine.

1321
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
That's SJW shit.

1322
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
And then he, and then he murders her.

1323
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
He murders her right in front of everybody.

1324
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,880
You know what?

1325
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,880
I guess he made his point.

1326
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,880
Burst into laughter.

1327
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,880
Yeah.

1328
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
That's aspirational.

1329
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,880
Yeah.

1330
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
That's aspirational for me.

1331
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,880
Yeah, you're going to find female Ben Sane and you're going to love her, then murder

1332
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,880
her.

1333
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
You can kill him.

1334
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,880
You find your female doppelganger and you've got to kill him before they kill you.

1335
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
That's what I've been told.

1336
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,880
That reminds me of an episode of Seinfeld where George was dating a female Jerry.

1337
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,880
Does anyone remember that?

1338
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Yeah.

1339
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,880
That sounds, you know, you could have faked that, but it sounds like a real episode.

1340
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:52,880
I guess I haven't, I thought I'd seen a lot of Seinfeld, but I guess you, whenever you

1341
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,880
reference a Seinfeld episode, I've never seen the episode you're talking about.

1342
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,880
Maybe I haven't seen as much as I thought.

1343
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,880
Um, I found a DVD copy of season one, two of Seinfeld and a Bush when I was just walking

1344
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,880
there.

1345
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,880
Yeah.

1346
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,880
Just walking behind it.

1347
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,880
You know, it's, back in my old neighborhood, I found a lot of like just VHS copies like

1348
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
in Bush's for some reason.

1349
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,880
It's like, yeah.

1350
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Well, maybe it was like, like somebody just thought I don't want this anymore, but I can't

1351
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,880
think of a way to get rid of it.

1352
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,880
So I just threw in a bush near the same place.

1353
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
I think it was on there.

1354
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
Yeah.

1355
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Yeah.

1356
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,880
I have gamers to have or no copy of Seinfeld.

1357
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,880
Um, but I think the logic is that, you know how, uh, give, I don't know if they have this

1358
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,880
or you live, um, but like sometimes people just leave like a couch on the sidewalk.

1359
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Oh yeah, that happens.

1360
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Yeah.

1361
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,880
So I think the logic is like, oh, I'm just going to leave all this like bullshit.

1362
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,880
I think one of the best things I found, one of the best like VHS as I found was, um, a

1363
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,880
complete like set of like Rod Serlin's favorite episode of the Twilight Zone.

1364
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,880
And, um, yeah.

1365
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Was that?

1366
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,880
No, I was just going, huh?

1367
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
Yeah.

1368
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,880
Yeah, exactly.

1369
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
Yeah.

1370
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
It was pretty strange.

1371
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,880
It was like right behind like a little dumpster as I was walking to a middle school and I

1372
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,880
was like, whoa, what the fuck?

1373
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
And I was like, huh.

1374
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,880
And then I grabbed all of them as fast as I can and I ran back to my house, dropped them

1375
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
off and went back to school.

1376
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
Right.

1377
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,880
And then when I came back, I made sure to see if they work and they, and they do work.

1378
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,880
They're pretty, um, they're pretty good condition, but now I don't have a VHS player anymore.

1379
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,880
I was pretty lucky.

1380
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,880
Yeah.

1381
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,880
No, it's, uh, it's crazy.

1382
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,880
Um, I don't go outside anymore.

1383
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,880
So there's probably a shitload of other DVDs and VHS.

1384
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,880
It's just piling up like the bush is getting slowly overtaken by VHS and DVDs.

1385
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Yeah.

1386
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,880
Well, when I was younger, I was like, um, before I went to get into comics, I was really big

1387
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,880
into film, so I was trying to consume as much film as possible.

1388
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
And I would just kind of collect any VHS I would find on the, on the street.

1389
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
Right.

1390
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,880
But, um, over time I developed a taste and I was like, I don't really got to keep the

1391
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,880
VHSs for the movies that I don't like.

1392
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,880
They just take up too much room, you know?

1393
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,880
Like I've been really, I've been really good about that recently where I just, I just now

1394
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:20,880
buy like movies that I like or just right now I just buy comics I want to read in the

1395
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
moment.

1396
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,880
I don't try to buy a comic that I'll eventually read because I feel like that's a waste of

1397
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
money.

1398
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,880
I want to just buy something.

1399
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
I know I'm going to read it when I get back home.

1400
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
What's the last comic you bought?

1401
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Uh, uh, Jack Kirby by Tom Schiele.

1402
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,880
Um, do you have Jack Kirby by Tom Schiele?

1403
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,880
Do you know who Jack Kirby is?

1404
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,880
I've heard the name.

1405
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,880
I know that, God, he, he is like a Marvel.

1406
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
Yeah, he's like, there wouldn't be a,

1407
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
Wait, wait, wait, he made the Kirby Crackle.

1408
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,880
He made the Kirby Crackle.

1409
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
Yeah, Kirby Crackle.

1410
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
I love the Kirby Crackle.

1411
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,880
Was he a DC?

1412
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,880
Was he a DC?

1413
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,880
Yeah, he went, he went back and forth a lot.

1414
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,880
Um, but there wouldn't be like a Marvel Universe without him.

1415
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,880
Like, uh, like Stan Lee, like sure he's credited as a writer,

1416
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,880
but he was more of like a glorified editor.

1417
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
Right.

1418
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,880
I see.

1419
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,880
And because Stanley was also the only guy, the only guy in comics with

1420
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
charisma, everybody remembers him.

1421
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:19,880
Um, but yeah, but I think Jack Kirby basically like saved Marvel and

1422
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,880
created, well, like it's debatable, but he did create like the majority

1423
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,880
of the universe.

1424
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,880
There's also a rumor that he possibly created Spider-Man.

1425
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Um, because, uh, back in the, yeah, because back, because, you know,

1426
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,880
Spider-Man is credited towards Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, which is true.

1427
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
That, which is true.

1428
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,880
That's still true.

1429
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,880
But what happened was that back in the day, um, like artists would,

1430
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,880
artists and creators would just kind of stockpile just like any superhero.

1431
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,880
Like they'll just come up with a random superhero.

1432
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,880
Like, oh, okay.

1433
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
Um, Spider-Man.

1434
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,880
And then he drew a picture of a, of a spider themed superhero and he just

1435
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,880
kept it in a filing cabinet.

1436
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Like, oh, maybe later.

1437
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,880
Like we're going to need like another superhero book and I can just pull

1438
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,880
this off and I'm like, okay, cool.

1439
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
I'll expand on this character.

1440
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,880
Right.

1441
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
So he just kept that in the filing cabinet for years.

1442
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,880
And then when he went back to, to, to basically, he basically went back to

1443
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,880
save Marvel.

1444
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,880
Um, Stan is all like, we need a, we need another superhero.

1445
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
And then he went for his filing cabinet.

1446
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,880
It's like, what about this, uh, Spider-Man?

1447
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,880
And then Stan Lee's like, uh, I'm not really digging the design.

1448
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
I'm going to get Steve Ditko to redesign it.

1449
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
And that's the design we have today.

1450
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,880
That actually, uh, reminds me of the origin of Mega Man because, um, mega,

1451
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,880
a KG Inifuna is often credited as a creator of Mega Man,

1452
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,880
but I think somebody else actually, uh, created him.

1453
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,880
So it's, uh, I guess kind of similar.

1454
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Didn't he, uh, design Mega Man?

1455
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,880
I don't remember now if he was on the design it or if somebody that was

1456
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,880
working with him at the time actually, uh, did the design.

1457
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,880
I think, um, I, from what I, tell me if this is the story you heard where Mega

1458
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,880
Man was originally like an Astro Boy game, but then they lost the license

1459
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,880
for Astro Boy.

1460
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,880
And so they had to redesign like, um, the main robot boy character.

1461
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
And they came up with Mega Man.

1462
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,880
And I think that was a KG Inifuna, maybe.

1463
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,880
Uh, that story sounds familiar, but I don't know if it's true or not.

1464
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,880
Yeah.

1465
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,880
I don't know if it's true.

1466
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
I mean, I read it.

1467
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,880
I think I read it.

1468
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
I can't remember where I read it.

1469
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,880
It's pretty obvious that Mega Man is inspired by Astro Boy.

1470
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Oh, yeah.

1471
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,880
I think Inifuna, uh, has stated that before.

1472
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,880
Mm-hmm.

1473
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
I'm a, I fucking love Astro Boy.

1474
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,880
I grew up with the Astro Boy manga that was, uh, republished by Black Horse.

1475
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,880
When I was younger, I would just keep checking out the Astro Boy, uh, manga from the library

1476
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,880
because I wanted my art style to look like that.

1477
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,880
Cause it was like, I think it was one of the first comics that I read and I'm like,

1478
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,880
whoa, you can make a comic that looks like cartoony.

1479
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,880
You don't have to make it realistic.

1480
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:49,880
And then I just checked all the Astro Boys out and I just tried to copy his, uh, his art style as much as I can.

1481
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,880
And this was like back in the start of middle school.

1482
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,880
And then towards the end of middle school, I was like trying to draw out of his art style.

1483
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,880
And I, I don't know if you could still see Osamata Suka's influence in my art style,

1484
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,880
but maybe barely there, but, um, yeah.

1485
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Yeah, Astro Boy is pretty cool.

1486
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:12,880
I don't know too much about the lore and stuff, but, um,

1487
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
I've seen it and it's cool.

1488
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,880
Um, actually my first exposure to Astro Boy was the, the game for the Game Boy Advance,

1489
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,880
uh, Me and My Treasure.

1490
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,880
Uh, that's a progress game.

1491
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,880
Yeah, that game is amazing.

1492
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,880
Yeah, yeah.

1493
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,880
It's, it made, it's one of those, uh, uh, good games.

1494
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,880
It's one of those.

1495
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,880
It's one of those games where like, like, like as a, as a video game goes,

1496
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
you know, it's like fun, like play in the game.

1497
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,880
But then there's a story element, which is like surprisingly gripping

1498
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
and like makes me cry.

1499
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,880
Ah, nice.

1500
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Yeah.

1501
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,880
The Astro Boy stories are like tiered jerkers.

1502
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,880
They also like move like really fast.

1503
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,880
Like they'll have like, they'll have like an anti-war message,

1504
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,880
but at the same time, like then in the next scene,

1505
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
like Astro Boy's got a beat up big robot.

1506
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
The pro war.

1507
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,880
No, no, no.

1508
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,880
Astro Boy is very anti-war.

1509
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,880
I mean, it came out post, um, post, uh, World War II

1510
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,880
and Japan was very like anti-war.

1511
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,880
And like, why do, why do, why do we live just to suffer?

1512
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
It's basically Astro Boy.

1513
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Um, they only said that because they lost.

1514
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,880
That's so serious.

1515
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,880
Leah, we'll lose your mentality.

1516
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Well, wow, maybe.

1517
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,880
War is actually good as long as you win.

1518
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,880
Maybe they shouldn't, they shouldn't stop being fascist

1519
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,880
and just became hardcore capitalists like us Americans.

1520
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
Asians are so bad at driving.

1521
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,880
I'm starting to think that Pearl Harbor was an accident.

1522
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Oh, no.

1523
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Oh, I swear I've heard that exact same joke somewhere.

1524
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
Actually, maybe I shouldn't have said that.

1525
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
Edit that.

1526
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,880
No, it's okay.

1527
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
Cancel the podcast.

1528
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,880
Cancel the podcast.

1529
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,880
Cancel the podcast.

1530
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,880
No, it's okay.

1531
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
I'll vouch for you.

1532
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,880
It's all right.

1533
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,880
Um, what was I going to say?

1534
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,880
Something about Imperial?

1535
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,880
I'll defend.

1536
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
What was I going to say?

1537
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,880
Racism.

1538
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,880
We're talking about Astro Boy.

1539
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,880
Oh, yes.

1540
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,880
Astro Boy.

1541
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,880
Uh, pretty sick.

1542
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
If there's only one Astro Boy story you should read,

1543
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,880
it's probably, uh, the world's strongest robot.

1544
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,880
Um, that's a good ass story.

1545
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Is that like a Shonen tournament arc?

1546
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,880
No, it's about, it's about some rich, uh,

1547
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,880
soddy looking asshole who like,

1548
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,880
who pays for the strongest robot called Pluto.

1549
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,880
And he's like this giant like devil looking robot.

1550
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,880
He has a really cool design.

1551
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Yeah.

1552
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,880
I think I remember Pluto.

1553
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,880
Yeah.

1554
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,880
There's like a list of,

1555
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,880
there's basically a list of like the most powerful robots

1556
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
and Astro Boy is on that list.

1557
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,880
Right.

1558
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1559
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,880
Is this the one Cyborg?

1560
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Is this Cyborg 009?

1561
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,880
They all wear red.

1562
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,880
No, no, no.

1563
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,880
That's a different thing.

1564
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,880
Cyborg 009 was created by a,

1565
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,880
I have this fucking,

1566
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,880
I have one of his mangoes right in front of me.

1567
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,880
It's, it's got that Astro Boy logo.

1568
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,880
Well, because the thing is that,

1569
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,880
um, he was the apprentice for Osamatsuka.

1570
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,880
Like he worked under him.

1571
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Yeah.

1572
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,880
Yeah.

1573
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
And then he became his equal.

1574
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
Okay.

1575
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
His name is Ashotaro Ishii Nomori.

1576
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
He, um, he created a Cyborg 009.

1577
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,880
He also basically created the Power Rangers too.

1578
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,880
And, um,

1579
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,880
A base.

1580
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,880
That's pretty interesting.

1581
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,880
Yeah.

1582
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,880
He, uh, he also created Common Rider.

1583
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
You guys ever heard of Common Rider?

1584
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,880
Yes.

1585
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,880
Yeah.

1586
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,880
And Common Rider basically has the same plot of Cyborg 009.

1587
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,880
The only difference is that in Cyborg 009,

1588
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,880
it's like a group of Cyborgs,

1589
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
but in Common Rider,

1590
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,880
it's only one Cyborg.

1591
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
Fun fact.

1592
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,880
How much do you think Mega Man is ripped off of Astro Boy?

1593
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,880
I haven't really played Mega Man games,

1594
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,880
but he looks so similar.

1595
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,880
I don't think,

1596
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,880
Not,

1597
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
I haven't really seen Astro Boy.

1598
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,880
I think actually,

1599
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,880
There is a heavy inspiration from Astro Boy.

1600
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,880
You know a lot about Mega Man and Astro Boy?

1601
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,880
I mean,

1602
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,880
Dr. Light is basically the guy who created Astro Boy.

1603
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,880
Does Astro Boy never kill a single robot master?

1604
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,880
No, no, Astro, no.

1605
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,880
Okay.

1606
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,880
So in Astro Boy,

1607
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,880
he kind of has two dads almost,

1608
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
or he has like three dads, technically,

1609
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
because the Astro Boy story is basically,

1610
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,880
there was,

1611
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
there was his kid,

1612
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
and he was like the son,

1613
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,880
like the head,

1614
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,880
yeah, Tobi,

1615
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,880
he was the son of the head ministry of science guy.

1616
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,880
I forget his name,

1617
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
but he was voiced by Nicholas Cage in the movie.

1618
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,880
Anyway,

1619
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,880
Nicholas Cage dad who kind of looks like Dr. Wiley,

1620
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
like a proto Dr. Wiley,

1621
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,880
like his son was driving and got into a car accident and died.

1622
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,880
And then he's all like,

1623
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
Oh no, my son.

1624
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
He's like,

1625
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Oh, I know,

1626
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
I'll build a robot son who's better

1627
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
and has a shitload of superpowers.

1628
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
So he builds his robot son.

1629
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
I wish my dad had said that to me.

1630
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
When Ben St died,

1631
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
I wish his dad was like,

1632
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
I'll build a better son.

1633
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
And he did.

1634
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,880
And his name was Nate Besman.

1635
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Oh my God.

1636
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,880
Yeah, you're right.

1637
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
It's in the name.

1638
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
It was, that's why he has the best mid name.

1639
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
Oh my God.

1640
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,880
It's glorifiedly exclaimed.

1641
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,880
That's why you can't see,

1642
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,880
he covers his eyes

1643
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,880
because you can see the circuitry through his pupils.

1644
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,880
That's why you two can no longer be in the same podcast.

1645
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
Right, exactly.

1646
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,880
Legally the same person.

1647
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,880
So he built his robot son

1648
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,880
and then he's like,

1649
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,880
Oh, I love my robot son.

1650
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,880
And until he doesn't,

1651
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,880
until he stops loving his robot son,

1652
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,880
because he's all like,

1653
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,880
he's only pretending to be human.

1654
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,880
I hate him.

1655
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,880
Get out.

1656
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
I hate you robot son.

1657
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,880
I don't want to be with you anymore.

1658
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,880
Right, exactly.

1659
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,880
And then his robot son gets adopted

1660
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
by the new head of the Ministry of Science

1661
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
who basically looks like Dr. Light,

1662
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,880
only with a huge nose.

1663
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,880
Yeah.

1664
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,880
And he's all like,

1665
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,880
I'm going to teach you how to be a good boy.

1666
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,880
Your name is Astro Boy now.

1667
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,880
You're like a superhero and shit.

1668
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,880
And I'm pretty sure.

1669
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,880
Wait, what was that?

1670
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,880
Did you say my name is asshole boy?

1671
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Okay, I'll be an asshole.

1672
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
He's called asshole boy.

1673
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
Isn't there a character named Astro Boy?

1674
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,880
Isn't there a character named Astro Boy

1675
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,880
that's like a proto man from Mega Man?

1676
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
Or, you know, do you know what I mean?

1677
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,880
Uh, Atlas.

1678
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,880
There's a couple of...

1679
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,880
Yeah, yeah, Atlas is like the anti-astro boy.

1680
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,880
But, um, I know the anime,

1681
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
he shows up pretty early on,

1682
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,880
but in the manga,

1683
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
which I'm more familiar with,

1684
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,880
he shows up like way later.

1685
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,880
And, um, yeah, Astro Boy is pretty sick.

1686
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,880
I think Astro Boy is kind of like a Mega Man

1687
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,880
with a much more detailed, complex plot.

1688
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,880
Because Mega Man just takes the basic premise of Astro Boy.

1689
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
It doesn't really, um,

1690
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,880
it doesn't really go too in depth on anything.

1691
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
A lot of, um, a lot of messaging.

1692
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,880
So, like, basically in Astro Boy's world,

1693
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,880
this is kind of crazy that, like, he was doing this

1694
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,880
like way before even, like,

1695
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,880
I think even the start of the civil rights movement,

1696
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
Osama Tsutsuko's writing of...

1697
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,880
Like, robots were so abundant in Astro Boy's world

1698
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,880
that they're like their own ethnicity at this point.

1699
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,880
Like, they're their own minority group, right?

1700
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Who wants, who wants, like, rights and whatnot.

1701
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
Yeah, that's like the part of Mega Man X.

1702
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically.

1703
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
And in Astro Boy's world, like, um,

1704
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
usually there'd be a bad robot,

1705
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,880
but they're only bad because they had, like, a bad creator,

1706
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,880
or were designed with evil purposes.

1707
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,880
Um, there's, like, a big thing in Astro Boy where it's like,

1708
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,880
the more human a robot looks, the more human it'll be,

1709
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
and the more good it will be.

1710
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
But if you make a robot look like a gun,

1711
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
it's gonna be a gun, right?

1712
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,880
And some, and then it's just gonna be programmed

1713
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,880
to wanna, you know, shoot people.

1714
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,880
Although, like, um, in Astro Boy's world

1715
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,880
they do follow, like, the three laws of robots.

1716
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Uh, what's it called?

1717
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,880
Yeah, the laws of robotics, I think.

1718
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,880
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, yeah.

1719
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
Exactly.

1720
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
It's also mentioned in Mega Man as well.

1721
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,880
Yeah, yeah, so in Astro Boy's world they have that.

1722
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,880
So Astro can't, like, can't kill any humans.

1723
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Although a lot of times, like,

1724
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
a lot of times they do the irony thing

1725
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
where it's like the evil human, like,

1726
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
collapses the building to collapse

1727
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
and then the rubble kills them, right?

1728
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,880
So robots didn't technically kill them, right?

1729
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,880
I'm quite familiar with that trope.

1730
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,880
What was that?

1731
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,880
I'm pretty familiar with that trope.

1732
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Uh, lots of media uses it.

1733
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Yeah, yeah, it's a very classic trope of, like,

1734
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,880
oh, it was his own undoing, right?

1735
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,880
Like his own selfishness causes his demise, right?

1736
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Yeah, basically.

1737
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,880
He's very, he's very classic trope.

1738
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,880
Um, and that's how, and that's how villain versus basic,

1739
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
we're gonna end, uh, spoilers.

1740
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,880
Okay.

1741
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
It's gonna be all the villain's fault.

1742
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,880
Oh, the villains were the fault?

1743
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,880
That comfy.

1744
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,880
Who could have seen, yeah, that's a, yeah.

1745
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
The villains were the bad guy?

1746
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,880
What the fuck?

1747
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,880
That's unusual.

1748
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,880
I, I hate it when comics tell me who the good guy

1749
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,880
or bad guy are.

1750
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,880
They need to be nuanced and subtle.

1751
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,880
I hate it.

1752
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Jesus Christ.

1753
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
Very cringe.

1754
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,880
Very cringe.

1755
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Very cringe.

1756
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Very cringe.

1757
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,880
But I think, uh, where Mega Man separates from

1758
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
the Astro Boy influences is probably, uh,

1759
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,880
from X onwards.

1760
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,880
That's when it becomes a lot less like Astro Boy.

1761
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,880
Mm-hmm.

1762
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,880
When it becomes base.

1763
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
It stops being stupid.

1764
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,880
When it gets a fucking dash button already.

1765
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
Yeah.

1766
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,880
Yeah.

1767
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Astro Boy doesn't have a dash button.

1768
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
Yeah.

1769
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,880
He doesn't.

1770
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Like he, he loves Tumblr.

1771
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,880
Yeah, because he's always tumbling down the stairs.

1772
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,880
He's, watch out for those stairs, uh, Mega Man X.

1773
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
Uh, I don't know what you're about.

1774
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
I can't deal with stairs.

1775
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,880
I, I only need, I, I, I can only do inclines that are smooth.

1776
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,880
The stairs.

1777
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,880
I can't dash up and down those.

1778
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,880
I always get strange stairs when I take the stairs.

1779
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,880
So I take the elevator instead.

1780
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,880
And then people elevate you in the elevator.

1781
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,880
Yeah, exactly.

1782
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
You get strange stairs because, um,

1783
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
because people are races.

1784
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,880
Uh, you mean races against stairs?

1785
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,880
We fixed races.

1786
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Oh yeah.

1787
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,880
Racism is gone.

1788
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,880
Once Obama was elected, like racism was over, right?

1789
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,880
That's right.

1790
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,880
That's the first thing you did.

1791
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Exactly.

1792
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,880
Yeah.

1793
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,880
He made racism illegal.

1794
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,880
And then, then Donald Trump went into office

1795
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,880
and made racism, racism legal.

1796
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,880
It's okay.

1797
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,880
God damn fact.

1798
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,880
It's going to be illegal.

1799
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,880
That orange man.

1800
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,880
It's going to be illegal again.

1801
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,880
It's going to be illegal again very soon.

1802
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,880
You just have to sign it.

1803
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,880
Thank you, Biden.

1804
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Oh, thanks, Biden.

1805
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,880
God, I'm, I'm writing Biden so hard I broke his dick.

1806
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,880
We know, we know Joe, right?

1807
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,880
We know him and he knows us inside and out.

1808
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
It's inside, whether we want to or not.

1809
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,880
That's right.

1810
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,880
Yeah, he, he, he knows that we're smooth.

1811
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,880
He hacked into all my emails so he knows a lot about me.

1812
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,880
Yeah.

1813
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,880
He's, he's petting me right now with his weird wrinkly old manhand.

1814
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,880
Joe Bile.

1815
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,880
It's going to be a, it's going to be a sexy four years.

1816
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,880
Oh, with Joe, Joe vile.

1817
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,880
Oh, I like that name.

1818
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,880
Are you going to use that name?

1819
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,880
Cause I'm going to use it for a villain name.

1820
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,880
I said Joe Bile, but vile also works.

1821
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,880
Bile, that's pretty good.

1822
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,880
He could be like a villain who pukes on people.

1823
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,880
Just got to remove his gold bar.

1824
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,880
Yeah, exactly.

1825
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
He could be like a wacky guy who just pukes on people.

1826
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,880
Um, I like, I come up, I have like a, I have a sketchbook, like a big sketchbook called

1827
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:40,880
the villain versus catalog and it just has every villain that appears in the, in the

1828
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,880
comic.

1829
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,880
Cause sometimes I can't remember how they all fucking look like.

1830
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,880
So when I need like a background shot with several villains, I go through it and I'm

1831
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,880
like, okay, that guy's going to be there.

1832
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,880
That guy's going to be there.

1833
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,880
Yeah.

1834
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,880
There's also a couple.

1835
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,880
Yeah.

1836
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,880
There's a lot of designs, a lot of, a lot of crazy guys in that, in that comic.

1837
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
It's impressive.

1838
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,880
Oh yeah.

1839
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,880
When it comes to me.

1840
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,880
Every page has like a new like fucking weird costume.

1841
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,880
Yeah.

1842
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Yeah.

1843
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
It's, it's a lot.

1844
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,880
I, I try so hard, but when I say that, I mean, I try not at all to make characters.

1845
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,880
Um, it's, um, it's really like easy.

1846
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,880
Like, so I guess I could, I could talk a little bit about the, the actually the real origin

1847
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:22,880
of Villainverse.

1848
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,880
Villainverse.

1849
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,880
Villainverse.

1850
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,880
Yeah.

1851
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,880
Exactly.

1852
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
Everyone's Velma.

1853
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,880
Everyone wants to be the most velvety of all the Velmas.

1854
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,880
Um, but back in a 2019, there was this guy called Craig Gleason on Instagram.

1855
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,880
And he's a really good artist and he has something called the bad guys club.

1856
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,880
Right.

1857
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,880
And basically it's like his, it's well that I like the son of that club.

1858
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,880
Oh yeah.

1859
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,880
It's a pretty cool club.

1860
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,880
Um, and he basically has, um, he has like the set of like characters called the bad guys

1861
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:00,880
who are members of the bad guys club and all just a bunch of wacky different monster guys.

1862
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,880
And every, every October he does like a, he does like a, his own version of Inktober called

1863
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,880
the season of the bad guys club.

1864
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,880
And every month you draw a different bad guy and he, but he also encourages people to like

1865
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,880
redesign the bad guys.

1866
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,880
Like, oh, just like take the name and just come up with a cool design for that name or

1867
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,880
whatever.

1868
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,880
He doesn't really care because he kind of likes when people like draw it and way wackier

1869
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,880
art styles or just, just anything.

1870
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,880
He just loves seeing it.

1871
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,880
And, um, and I was doing that.

1872
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,880
And I mean, I've been, I've been fans of this guy for like, I've been a fan of this guy

1873
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,880
for like years.

1874
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,880
And then, um, I finally did it back in 2019 and every bad guy I created, I was thinking

1875
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,880
like, huh, I like, I think I'm pretty decent at coming up with like stories for characters

1876
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,880
on the spot.

1877
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,880
And, um, and I came up with like a lot, several stories.

1878
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,880
And I was like, I could probably make a comic about like all these characters existing in

1879
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
the same universe.

1880
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Right.

1881
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,880
And originally I was going to pitch it to Craig Leeson as like some sort of anthology,

1882
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,880
but then I thought, why should I give that guy like my good ideas?

1883
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
I should just use my good ideas for myself.

1884
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,880
I don't need to like get someone to do a good idea.

1885
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,880
Yeah, exactly.

1886
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,880
So I'm thinking like, okay, time to, time to take all the designs that are different

1887
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:15,880
enough and then take all the other designs that I like, but like change them to make

1888
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,880
them legally distinct.

1889
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,880
Right.

1890
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,880
And then, and then, and then you, did you see the logic there?

1891
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Like, I mean, it's easy to see how I jumped from that guy's club to villain verse.

1892
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,880
Right.

1893
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,880
I don't get it.

1894
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,880
I don't get it.

1895
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:36,880
And, and basically like the list, the list exists because, um, because like it's kind

1896
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,880
of like, how do I make these guys like, what's the relationship between all these like villains?

1897
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,880
Like, why do they give a fuck about each other?

1898
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,880
Then it's like, well, there's a list.

1899
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,880
So they're in a constant competition.

1900
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Right.

1901
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,880
And, um, and basically like, I think from there it's like, like, I think some good advice

1902
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,880
for like a designer character is to kind of know exactly what you like.

1903
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,880
Right.

1904
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Like, um, like for example, there's a, there's one character in villain verse called dirty

1905
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,880
bomb.

1906
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,880
Um, yeah, she's like a bomb girl.

1907
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:12,880
And she's actually based on another character called the moon goon from bad guys club basically

1908
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,880
right.

1909
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,880
And the moon goon is like this guy who has like a, who has like a giant like moon for

1910
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,880
a head.

1911
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,880
And, um, and so I looked at that guy and I thought to myself, what do I like about this

1912
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,880
guy?

1913
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,880
Well, I like his like round head.

1914
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,880
I like his like constant smile.

1915
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,880
And I kind of like all the accessories he has on him.

1916
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,880
Right.

1917
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,880
So it's like, well, I like his round head.

1918
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,880
What else is round?

1919
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,880
Oh, well, bombs are round.

1920
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,880
Right.

1921
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,880
Like the little cartoon bombs are round.

1922
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,880
Right.

1923
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,880
So it's just from there.

1924
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,880
Like then I kind of like, oh, you know, spots are also round.

1925
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,880
So I added that on her.

1926
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,880
Um, gave her a couple like frills and whatnot.

1927
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:48,880
Yeah.

1928
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,880
Yeah.

1929
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,880
That's what he looks like.

1930
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,880
Right.

1931
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,880
God, what a freak.

1932
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,880
That's an interesting design.

1933
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,880
No, I, no, I, yeah, I love them.

1934
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,880
I got them.

1935
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,880
I have a shirt of him.

1936
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,880
Um, and so yeah.

1937
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:04,720
So basically you kind of see how I jumped from the moon goon design to a dirty bomb over

1938
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,720
here.

1939
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,720
Oh, I really liked that one.

1940
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,720
Right.

1941
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,720
That's pretty cool.

1942
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,720
Thank you.

1943
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:16,040
And, um, and basically like, um, her like, we don't see this in like chapter one, but

1944
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:20,280
like what she could do is like those spots on her clothes, like she could peel them off

1945
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,280
like stickers.

1946
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,920
But once she peels them off, they turn it to like little like bombs, right?

1947
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,480
Then she could throw and her, her, um, her suit just like respawns them.

1948
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,480
That's very clever.

1949
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,240
She has like a, yeah, she has like a near infant internet, like amount of bombs.

1950
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,160
I feel like there's another character.

1951
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,160
They don't make bombs.

1952
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:47,520
I just think like some, some looney tunes thing where like the, like holes, like pulling

1953
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,240
like holes off there.

1954
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,240
Yeah.

1955
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,240
Oh, wait.

1956
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,240
Oh, wait.

1957
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,760
I'm talking about Maggie and her ferocious beast.

1958
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,760
Am I?

1959
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,640
Cause the ferocious beast has spots that could be removed.

1960
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,640
Shit.

1961
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,640
Yeah.

1962
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,760
Maybe I'm thinking of Maggie, the ferocious beast.

1963
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,760
Uh, possibly.

1964
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,760
It's a good show.

1965
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,760
Pretty, pretty base.

1966
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,760
Pretty, pretty good.

1967
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,760
There's pretty good lineage there.

1968
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,920
There's also a Bomberman.

1969
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,760
Does anyone remember that guy?

1970
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,760
Oh yeah.

1971
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,760
That's true.

1972
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,760
Love that guy.

1973
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,760
Of course.

1974
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,760
Who could forget Bomberman?

1975
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,760
Who could forget Bomberman?

1976
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,760
He's requested a Super Smash Brothers character.

1977
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,760
Even, even more requested than Goku?

1978
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,760
Uh, well, that was a joke, but.

1979
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,760
Oh, okay.

1980
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,760
Oh my bad.

1981
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,760
I, I took Goku 100% seriously.

1982
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,760
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1983
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,760
Wait, why isn't Bomberman in Smash?

1984
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,760
They, they made a, um, uh, a skin, like a me.

1985
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,760
I think he's in as an instant movie now.

1986
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,760
That doesn't count.

1987
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,760
No, he's in as a meat costume.

1988
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,760
I think.

1989
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,760
Yeah.

1990
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,760
And also as a costume.

1991
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,760
I'm, I'm sorry.

1992
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,760
If ice climbers get in, Bomberman should be in.

1993
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,760
Yeah.

1994
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,760
I mean, they should have them in because they have a Simon Belmont and Bomberman is not

1995
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,760
currently owned by Konami.

1996
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,760
Um.

1997
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:15,760
I've never, I've never heard a more obvious pick.

1998
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,760
The next, um, the next reveal is going to be a Fortnite, uh, character.

1999
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,760
No.

2000
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,760
No.

2001
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,760
Fortnite doesn't have characters though, does it?

2002
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,760
It just has.

2003
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,760
Yeah.

2004
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,760
Humanoids.

2005
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,760
Humanoids with guns.

2006
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:35,760
So actually the main story, the main story of Fortnite is like a zombie survivor game.

2007
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,760
I knew that.

2008
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,760
So like that, that story.

2009
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,760
That's not the thing people care about though.

2010
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,760
That's like, no, no, they care about the free, like, battle royale thing.

2011
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,760
Right.

2012
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,760
They put Steve for Minecraft.

2013
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,760
Plants versus zombies and smash.

2014
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,760
They've already got Piranha Plant.

2015
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,760
Yeah, exactly.

2016
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,760
I'm going to put Sands on the tail and smash.

2017
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,760
I want Sands.

2018
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,760
He's in here.

2019
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,760
Yeah.

2020
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,760
Yeah.

2021
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,760
We should get Sands.

2022
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,760
It's not the same.

2023
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,760
We should definitely get Sands.

2024
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,760
Oh my God.

2025
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,760
Where is he?

2026
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,760
Where is the boy?

2027
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,760
Where is Sands?

2028
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,760
Where is Sands?

2029
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,760
Where is Sands from the best video game ever made Undertale?

2030
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,760
Where is he?

2031
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:23,760
You know, I was playing Smash Wii U with my brothers just now before I got in the call.

2032
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,760
Or maybe a few hours ago.

2033
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,760
So that's what you were doing.

2034
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,760
Well, it wasn't just that.

2035
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,760
It was just like hanging out and having fun.

2036
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,760
Shut up.

2037
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,760
Shut up.

2038
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,760
Anyway.

2039
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
That sounded like a smashing good time.

2040
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,760
It was cool.

2041
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:42,760
We were all playing as our Mies and I had to, I had the, I could change my Mie to be like

2042
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,760
a female and like make it look different.

2043
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,760
And it was cool.

2044
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,760
Nice.

2045
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,760
And I shot them and I was shooting them just in the side.

2046
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,760
Nothing special about that.

2047
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,760
But Smash Brothers is fun.

2048
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,760
It doesn't matter what characters are in it.

2049
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,760
You just play the game and you win and you destroy the competition.

2050
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:59,760
Yeah.

2051
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,760
It's just like war.

2052
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,760
It's cool as long as you win.

2053
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,760
Yeah.

2054
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,760
It is fun, but I usually lose in it nowadays.

2055
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,760
I don't usually typically win.

2056
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,760
Yeah.

2057
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,760
Yeah.

2058
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,760
I'm not super great at it.

2059
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,760
Online.

2060
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,760
I'm prone to underhanded tactics.

2061
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:19,760
Online is terrible just because people care about Smash and they practice and they're

2062
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:27,760
on the line, but in a room with siblings, you can say fuck and then you can have like

2063
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,760
a cup of tea and talk about something else afterwards.

2064
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,760
God.

2065
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,760
With a person online, they just, I don't know, they do a Dark Souls emote and they shit on

2066
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,760
your face and you don't feel like anything is good.

2067
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:45,760
When I was younger, I was playing Smash Brothers at a friend's house and I was like saying fucking

2068
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,760
shit and when I was playing and then their mother snitched on my mom and told her that

2069
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,760
I was cussing and I'm like, that fucking cunt bitch.

2070
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,760
That's a tale as old as time itself.

2071
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,760
Yeah.

2072
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,760
Fucking bitch.

2073
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,760
She fucking ratted me out.

2074
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,760
I hope she gets lung cancer.

2075
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,760
She's gonna probably eventually.

2076
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,760
She smoked a lot.

2077
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,760
Did you know that your son cussed?

2078
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,760
I think that's more of like a thing she's saying about like to your mom like, oh, you're a bad

2079
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,760
parent.

2080
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,760
You have a child that cusses.

2081
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,760
I just want to rub that in your face.

2082
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
Yeah.

2083
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,760
Yeah.

2084
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:22,760
But then obviously the wrath is going to fall on the son.

2085
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,760
The mom is gonna be scolded because her son is like, isn't potty trained.

2086
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,760
Hasn't been broken like a horse and re-forced into a valuable citizen.

2087
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,760
Rats from full metal.

2088
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,760
She's gonna unleash her vengeance upon him.

2089
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,760
And then as my mom was beating me for cussing at Smash Bros.

2090
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:43,760
She says, don't blame me.

2091
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,760
Blame capitalism.

2092
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,760
That's when it all connected.

2093
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,760
Everything clicked in my brain.

2094
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,760
I was like, of course.

2095
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,760
Obviously this is capitalism right now.

2096
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,760
She was beating me.

2097
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,760
I'm only doing this because it's advantageous to me financially.

2098
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,760
Exactly.

2099
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,760
Ironically though.

2100
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,760
This is what you get for not performing your role as a member of society.

2101
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,760
Isn't that why anyone does anything?

2102
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:13,760
Yeah.

2103
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,760
Yeah.

2104
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,760
We'll get spanked in certain ways.

2105
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,760
To avoid the big beating and rich people, they hate getting the beating.

2106
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,760
That's why they try to make as much money as they can to avoid it.

2107
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,760
They've got weak buttocks.

2108
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,760
That's what it is.

2109
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,760
Exactly.

2110
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,760
They've got buttocks made of paper.

2111
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,760
They need to do more squats.

2112
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,760
I think Donald Trump is probably the only rich person with a good butt.

2113
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,760
It's massive if you've seen the photos.

2114
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,760
I'm sure there's got to be some other people.

2115
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,760
I have not seen the photos of Trump's massive behind.

2116
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,760
Yeah.

2117
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,760
I've seen diaper Trump.

2118
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,760
Yeah.

2119
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,760
It's pretty huge.

2120
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,760
Have you seen his son?

2121
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,760
His son is like tall as fuck.

2122
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,760
Holy shit.

2123
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,760
Baron is a real beanpole.

2124
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,760
He's a real fucking monster.

2125
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,760
You can fucking...

2126
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,760
Yeah.

2127
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,760
He's a real super soldier in the making.

2128
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,760
You could say he's pretty good for a Baron.

2129
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,760
He's a real...

2130
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,760
If you see Baron right next to Trump, they look like one piece characters.

2131
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,760
Yeah.

2132
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,760
Yeah, a little bit.

2133
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:16,760
Wait, isn't that the best way to look?

2134
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,760
Trump's like pretty tall, right?

2135
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,760
Trump's like six foot one or something, right?

2136
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,760
So Baron's got to be like eight foot nine.

2137
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,760
Wait, how old is Baron?

2138
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,760
He looks like an eight year old.

2139
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Eighteen?

2140
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,760
He's like a teenager.

2141
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,760
He loves anime.

2142
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,760
Yeah, he was like ten or something.

2143
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,760
I think when the presidency first started, now he's like straight up ten.

2144
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,760
Now he's like forty.

2145
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,760
Okay, so who's Trump's other son?

2146
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,760
Wait a minute.

2147
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,760
Oh, Don Jr.

2148
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,760
He got chubby.

2149
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:46,760
When did Baron Trump get chubby?

2150
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,760
This is fucking...

2151
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,760
No, no, he's supposed to be skinny.

2152
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,760
He's unattractive now.

2153
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,760
I do not like him no more.

2154
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,760
That's clearly the anime's fault.

2155
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:03,760
There's Don Jr. who's like the infamous son where Donald Trump was like,

2156
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,760
I don't want to name my son after myself.

2157
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,760
What if he's a loser?

2158
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,760
What if he's a loser?

2159
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,760
God, this little fucking monster is going to be a thorn in all of our sides

2160
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,760
for the rest of our lives.

2161
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,760
He's going to try to run for presidency,

2162
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,760
but he's going to have the fucking charisma like his father does

2163
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,760
to actually pull it off.

2164
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,760
No.

2165
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,760
This guy's not a hero like Donald Trump.

2166
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,760
He's not a populist hero.

2167
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,760
He doesn't look like Trump enough to...

2168
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,760
I think the average person would be like,

2169
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,760
I guess it's just some guy.

2170
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,760
I mean, he's from the first or second marriage?

2171
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,760
I don't know.

2172
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,760
I think Milani is like that dirt, isn't he?

2173
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,760
Well, I hope the entire family eventually tries to run for president.

2174
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,760
Oh, yeah.

2175
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,760
You know, like what the Bushes did?

2176
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,760
They're all going to run against each other.

2177
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,760
And Eric and Don Jr. are going to be like running against each other

2178
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,760
in the next primary.

2179
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
That would be great.

2180
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,760
Ivanka is probably going to win.

2181
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,760
She's going to be first female president, finally.

2182
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,760
Yeah, like half of them will run as Republicans,

2183
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
half of them will run as Democrats.

2184
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,760
So, you know, to thin the crowd out a little bit.

2185
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,760
Finally, finally, sexism is over.

2186
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,760
Now we have a woman president.

2187
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,760
Based, based.

2188
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,760
About time.

2189
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,760
He does have the hand thing going on.

2190
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,760
This image loads.

2191
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,760
Tiny hands.

2192
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,760
Something about the gesture.

2193
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,760
His hands are...

2194
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,760
Well, I...

2195
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,760
Yeah, he does have the hand thing.

2196
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,760
He does.

2197
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,760
China.

2198
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,760
He got that look.

2199
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,760
China.

2200
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,760
Chinese virus.

2201
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,760
He's got that hella look on his face.

2202
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Looking at the chat now, we've got like a list of characters.

2203
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,760
All confirmed for Smash.

2204
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,760
All potential Smash characters.

2205
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,760
Nice.

2206
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,760
Oh, did you see the thick Clarissa I posted that earlier?

2207
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,760
I did.

2208
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,760
Yeah, yeah.

2209
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,760
I do not forgive as a thank you for the GoFundMe.

2210
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,760
There's a lot of people who like,

2211
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,760
could get a commission from me because of the GoFundMe,

2212
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,760
but it just haven't DM me yet.

2213
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,760
And I don't really care too much about reminding them to be honest.

2214
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:21,760
I think I owe a handful of people from some patron rewards.

2215
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,760
I think one person, one Bev asked me to,

2216
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,760
for her reward, she wanted me to do another top killer's RFCK image,

2217
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,760
which I am like a fucking year overdue on.

2218
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,760
So I'll have to do that at some point.

2219
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,760
Oh wait, this is my end right now.

2220
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,760
Hey kids, you like RFCK?

2221
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,760
You like the game where if your character dies,

2222
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,760
they don't really die.

2223
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,760
They come back thanks to a green slime.

2224
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,760
Yes.

2225
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,760
That's literally villain verse.

2226
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,760
Oh my God.

2227
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,760
And no one can die.

2228
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,760
No one in villain verse could die.

2229
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,760
Oh my God.

2230
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,760
They all drank a chemical called Regeneradium,

2231
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,760
and it makes them all deadpool basically.

2232
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,760
Just like real life.

2233
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,760
Just like real life.

2234
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,760
It's just an evergreen premise.

2235
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:09,760
Exactly.

2236
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,760
So every character comes back so you can still have your favorite

2237
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,760
and they won't die.

2238
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,760
It's fucking great.

2239
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,760
You can just see them lose over and over again.

2240
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,760
Exactly.

2241
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,760
It's like everyone's playing on Gmod,

2242
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,760
but in real life, but in a comic.

2243
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,760
Not in real life actually, but almost.

2244
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,760
Almost.

2245
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,760
In their real life, in their universe,

2246
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,760
their villain verse if you will.

2247
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,760
To coin a phrase.

2248
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,760
Do we want to start listening to voicemails maybe?

2249
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,760
We've been going for an hour and a half.

2250
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,760
I got like an hour and ten minutes here.

2251
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,760
What do you think?

2252
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,760
What do you think?

2253
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,760
Should we start voicemails?

2254
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,760
Give.

2255
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,760
Back me up.

2256
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,760
In real life.

2257
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,760
Okay, I mean if you've all got such important shit to talk about,

2258
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,760
by all means.

2259
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,760
No.

2260
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,760
Never mind.

2261
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,760
No voicemails.

2262
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:03,760
No, I don't.

2263
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,760
No, I won't post them.

2264
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,760
After all.

2265
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:12,760
I think it didn't give me how I could pump out comics so fast earlier.

2266
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,760
Yeah, I wanted to talk about that a little bit,

2267
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:22,760
because I've been very non-existent with what I've been putting out.

2268
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,760
I made the Clarissa half of it,

2269
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,760
and I said I would do the rest,

2270
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,760
and then I stopped, and it feels bad.

2271
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,760
Not sure about it all day, every day.

2272
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,760
I was thinking a little bit.

2273
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,760
Sorry I haven't made a comic in a while.

2274
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,760
Yeah.

2275
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,760
Sorry I haven't made a comic in a while.

2276
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
Yeah.

2277
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,760
You kind of have to unironically treat it like a job.

2278
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:49,760
Well, yes.

2279
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,760
Like, no, but I'm not saying that like, oh, obviously,

2280
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,760
but I mean like, no, actually, like, for example,

2281
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,760
Monday through Friday is when I just work on the comic,

2282
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,760
and I just do nothing but the comic on Monday through Friday.

2283
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:08,760
Saturday and Sunday is when I go to my job and I make money,

2284
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,760
but there are the week,

2285
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,760
I just got to have to just work on the comic.

2286
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,760
Like, just whatever you can.

2287
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,760
Like, you should also try to like,

2288
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,760
make sure the day before you have everything set up

2289
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,760
so you can just jump right into it the next day, right?

2290
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,760
Yeah.

2291
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,760
When I do my comic, I always like do the panels first,

2292
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,760
like where the panels are going to go,

2293
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,760
and then I'll have that ready,

2294
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,760
so then tomorrow I'll have to do just draw inside the panels, right?

2295
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,760
Having everything ready to go so you can just jump right in is big.

2296
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,760
It is pretty good.

2297
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,760
I mean, how I write, how I do villain versus basically,

2298
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,760
so I have the whole story like outline,

2299
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,760
like each chapter has a summary,

2300
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:51,760
and it's like a, it's like a skeleton of an outline, right?

2301
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
So I know what happens in each chapter,

2302
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
but I don't know specifically what happens,

2303
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,760
and that's kind of like the fun part.

2304
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,760
That's the kind of like, like, oh, I know where the story is going,

2305
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,760
but the smaller details, the little, like,

2306
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,760
intricacies and nuances,

2307
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,760
I'm discovering that with everybody else, right?

2308
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,760
So what I do is I do a rough draft of the comic,

2309
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,760
and just to finish it, I just, the rough draft,

2310
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,760
like I don't focus too much on like whether it's perfect,

2311
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,760
just to finish it, just to have a rough draft,

2312
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,760
and then I'll look at it like the next day,

2313
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,760
and I'll like, like, you know, edit it to make sure it's like,

2314
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:32,760
I lower the page number, I add more pages, right?

2315
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,760
Or I like combine pages together until like,

2316
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,760
it kind of like flows well, you know?

2317
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,760
And then I start like drawing it,

2318
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,760
and I draw it on a deleter paper,

2319
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,760
which is like what manga artists use, right?

2320
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,760
And even while I'm drawing it,

2321
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,760
I'm still like editing it,

2322
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,760
because like I could like be drawing it,

2323
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,760
and I'm like, wait a second,

2324
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,760
I kind of don't like how this looks.

2325
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:53,760
I think I'm gonna add an extra page

2326
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,760
to kind of balance it out, or lower it,

2327
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,760
but I consistently try to stay under like 30 pages.

2328
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,760
I think the highest I've ever been is like 26 pages.

2329
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,760
That might change though.

2330
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,760
Sounds like a professional.

2331
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,760
It is, it's a very, like,

2332
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,760
I mean, that's how I managed to do that,

2333
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,760
that Clarissa in that month,

2334
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,760
leading up to the contest entry,

2335
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,760
was that I streamed it,

2336
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,760
which was like the way to like not get distracted.

2337
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,760
And I managed to do quite a lot of work during the day,

2338
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,760
but it was too much,

2339
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,760
and I ended up burning myself out.

2340
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,760
And I just, I don't know,

2341
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,760
maybe I'm just like a, like a stupid idiot,

2342
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,760
but I don't know how to like motivate myself

2343
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,760
to work without a stream.

2344
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,760
And I don't want to have to stream,

2345
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,760
because like that's extra,

2346
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,760
like I need to-

2347
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,760
Alright, now I get you.

2348
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
I forget like a lot of things.

2349
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,760
Like it's been very long since I played video games

2350
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,760
or like seen a show.

2351
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,760
Actually, wait, hold up.

2352
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,760
I actually have been watching shows while I'm drawing,

2353
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,760
but like, so I do this thing where I look for shows

2354
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,760
that aren't good or bad, just okay,

2355
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:07,760
and I just play them in the background.

2356
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,760
Right?

2357
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,760
There's a show called Legends of Tomorrow,

2358
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,760
and it's a spin-off show from like the Flash TV show.

2359
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,760
And Legends of Tomorrow is like, okay,

2360
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,760
it's the most okay show I've ever seen,

2361
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,760
which makes it perfect.

2362
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,760
So I just play it in the background,

2363
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,760
so I don't have to like pay too much attention to it.

2364
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,760
But I think like, I don't know,

2365
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,760
like you're just going to have to like,

2366
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,760
I guess I'm just,

2367
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,760
I really just want to finish Villainverse.

2368
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
If there was like a button that I could press

2369
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,760
and like Villainverse is like instantly done,

2370
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,760
I would press that button.

2371
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,760
So I think that's like what motivated me,

2372
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,760
because I really do want to see what the whole thing looks like.

2373
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,760
And I think also because I really like Villainverse too,

2374
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,760
like I'm also a fan,

2375
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,760
because once I try to read the prologue,

2376
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,760
I want to read the rest.

2377
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,760
Like I can't just like look at the chapter one

2378
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,760
and just like reference it quickly.

2379
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,760
Like I, if I look at chapter one,

2380
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,760
I'm going to start reading it

2381
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,760
and I'm going to like have to stop myself

2382
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,760
like hold up, don't finish it.

2383
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,760
Just keep working on like what you're doing, right?

2384
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,760
I feel like I do get distracted a lot,

2385
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,760
mostly through Twitter,

2386
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,760
but like the fact that that hasn't like hindered

2387
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,760
the production of Villainverse

2388
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,760
is why I don't really perceive it.

2389
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,760
That's too much of a problem, right?

2390
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,760
I mean, I'll try to like do less Twitter arguments

2391
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
when I'm working on the comic, right?

2392
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,760
But it's just, I'm just really looking,

2393
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,760
it's like I'm really looking forward

2394
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,760
to how Villainverse is going to look like.

2395
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,760
I'm really looking forward to how my art style

2396
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,760
is going to look like by chapter 12.

2397
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,760
That's like one of my end goals.

2398
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,760
Also, I want to know how Villainverse is going to end.

2399
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,760
Well, I mean, I know Villainverse is going to end,

2400
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,760
but I want to see everything go down.

2401
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,760
I also want to be financially stable.

2402
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,760
And I think that's kind of going to be the end goal

2403
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,760
for like Villainverse.

2404
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,760
Like there's a bunch of other comics I want to do

2405
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,760
and I want to make those comics too,

2406
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,760
but I got to get for Villainverse first, you know?

2407
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,760
There's just like, yeah, just, I don't know.

2408
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,760
I think that motivates me.

2409
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,760
I think what also helps is that I don't have like

2410
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,760
depression or anxiety or anything like that, right?

2411
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,760
Base.

2412
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,760
So, yeah.

2413
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,760
Narotypical gang representation.

2414
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,760
Narotypical gang, yeah.

2415
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,760
Like, assemble.

2416
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,760
One time, I tell the story like almost

2417
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,760
on every other fucking podcast I'm on,

2418
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,760
but you ever heard of Meg Moggenau?

2419
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,760
I have.

2420
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,760
Yeah, that's a thing.

2421
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,760
Comic.

2422
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,760
Yeah, it's a comic.

2423
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:29,760
It's a really good comic.

2424
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
It's kind of like train spotting,

2425
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,760
but if everyone was like a monster.

2426
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,760
But basically, I asked the creator of Meg Moggenau

2427
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,760
at Comic-Con, like, I asked him a question

2428
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,760
for a friend, right?

2429
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,760
And I was like, how do you like make comics

2430
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,760
with depression?

2431
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,760
And he told me, oh, here's the therapy, right?

2432
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,760
Because he said that he only started

2433
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,760
really making comics in his 30s, right?

2434
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:59,760
And now he's like an indie comic legend.

2435
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,760
What's really fucking crazy is that currently

2436
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,760
right now for every day since the start

2437
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,760
of the quarantine, he drew a comic,

2438
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,760
like a one-page Meg Moggenau comic

2439
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,760
with its own like long continuity

2440
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:13,760
and it's fucking legendary.

2441
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,760
Jesus Christ.

2442
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
I mean, the thing is that he also admitted

2443
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,760
that he's a workaholic, right?

2444
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,760
And I'm kind of like that too.

2445
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,760
For the longest time, I never thought

2446
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,760
that I would get like a partner,

2447
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,760
like an emotional partner,

2448
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,760
like I would be in a strong relationship

2449
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,760
unless it was someone who also does art

2450
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,760
and would be on the same schedule.

2451
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,760
I mean, now I'm in a relationship,

2452
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,760
but what's great is that the person I'm with

2453
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,760
understands like my schedule like perfectly

2454
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,760
and doesn't like bother me

2455
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,760
when I'm like working on my own shit

2456
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,760
and they also do art.

2457
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,760
So it's not too bad.

2458
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,760
Also, I think a great video to watch is

2459
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,760
this video, how to be creative,

2460
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,760
how an artist turns pro.

2461
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,760
This is a really good video.

2462
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,760
I try to watch this video like every month

2463
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,760
just to keep myself on track, right?

2464
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,760
Let me see.

2465
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,760
Did you post it?

2466
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,760
Yeah, I posted there in the general.

2467
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,760
It's a really good video.

2468
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,760
It just explains how like,

2469
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,760
anyone could become an amateur at any second.

2470
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,760
You can just become an amateur, right?

2471
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,760
But this video talks about how you

2472
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,760
consistently become a pro, right?

2473
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,760
And the thing is like,

2474
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,760
even before I watched this video,

2475
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,760
I kind of agreed with everything it said,

2476
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,760
but there's something so great about being reassured

2477
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,760
that you're on the right track, right?

2478
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,760
Yeah.

2479
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,760
Like, sure, this is all the information

2480
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,760
you heard before,

2481
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,760
but the fact that other people kind of believe this,

2482
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,760
it feels like, oh, so I'm really not in the wrong path.

2483
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,760
I'm in a good path.

2484
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,760
I guess what also helps is that like,

2485
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,760
I did an internship at a comic book publisher

2486
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,760
and they just explained to me how to get published.

2487
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,760
And I was like, oh, cool.

2488
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,760
So I just got to do the comic and I'm good.

2489
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,760
I think having a good work ethic

2490
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,760
is something that can benefit you

2491
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,760
no matter what it is you're doing.

2492
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
And if you enjoy what you're doing,

2493
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,760
it would help you have a better work ethic.

2494
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760
But even if you don't,

2495
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,760
the work ethic can be a separate thing

2496
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,760
that gets you motivated.

2497
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,760
Yeah, like, and I do enjoy,

2498
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,760
I do enjoy like drawing comics and whatnot.

2499
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,760
I have forgotten like a lot of like social gatherings

2500
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,760
just to work on the comic.

2501
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,760
If I could get my Patreon to like 800 a month,

2502
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,760
then I could do a second comic,

2503
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,760
but I kind of want to do that too.

2504
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,760
There's like other ideas that are like a little bit easier

2505
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,760
for me to do that I could like bullshit on a weekend.

2506
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,760
Is that like, is that like what it would take

2507
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,760
for you to be like full time, I guess?

2508
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,760
Yeah, yeah, like 800 on Patreon.

2509
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,760
Yeah.

2510
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,760
Yeah, that'd be like the end goal.

2511
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,760
If I could like, I think what I was going to do

2512
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,760
on my Patreon was like, if I could get to 200 a month,

2513
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:54,760
I'll do a pasta, the clown, the comic.

2514
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,760
Because I have an outline.

2515
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Yeah, I have an outline for that too.

2516
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,760
And I know it won't be too hard.

2517
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,760
It won't be like, I won't try as hard.

2518
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,760
Like I'm not going to put as much effort as I'm doing

2519
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,760
with Villainverse.

2520
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:07,760
Like it's going to be its like own little like shit post

2521
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,760
of a comic.

2522
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,760
Yeah, there's a bunch of other comics I wanted to do.

2523
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,760
I want to, I want to tell you what those are.

2524
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,760
Cause I want to save a few secrets.

2525
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,760
I don't want you guys to steal my genius ideas

2526
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,760
that are popping out of my brain.

2527
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,760
I think also eliminating distractions,

2528
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,760
unless the distractions help you inspire you to do

2529
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:32,760
what you're doing, that's also probably good advice.

2530
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,760
Yeah, true, true that.

2531
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,760
There's this thing I do where like,

2532
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:39,760
every time I finish a chapter of Villainverse,

2533
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:44,760
I reward myself by catching up with One Piece.

2534
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,760
Right?

2535
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:51,760
That's something I got to reward myself with one of these days.

2536
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,760
Yeah, I like that.

2537
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,760
That's good.

2538
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,760
That would actually work for me, I think,

2539
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,760
cause like there's, I have a lot of One Piece left

2540
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,760
to get through.

2541
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,760
Like I might even, I probably have like 50 or 60 chapters left.

2542
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,760
I'm not too far behind one.

2543
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,760
I think I'm just like maybe 10 chapters behind maybe.

2544
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,760
I've been like lagging a lot with this chapter has been taking

2545
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,760
a good while because I moved out.

2546
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,760
I've been trying to get accustomed to this new job.

2547
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,760
I got into a relationship.

2548
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,760
I had to help my partner move to another state.

2549
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,760
It's a, it's a bunch of, it's a bunch of stuff that been a lot

2550
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,760
of like life changing moves have happened in the past couple

2551
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,760
of months for me.

2552
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,760
Also, there's the fucking pandemic.

2553
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,760
Oh, sure.

2554
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,760
Yeah, at the start, I was like,

2555
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,760
yeah, at the start, I was pretty, I was doing pretty fine.

2556
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,760
I managed to get like two chapters in the pandemic.

2557
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,760
But then like, I don't know, I guess the move

2558
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:43,760
and all the other stuff.

2559
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,760
Also, my computer was like fucking on its last leg

2560
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,760
and all this bullshit I had to do.

2561
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,760
Um, yeah, it's just fucking, it was fucking ass.

2562
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,760
But now, now next month, it's going to be good.

2563
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,760
I'm going to try to finish villain burst by the, by next year

2564
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,760
this month is when I want villain burst to be over.

2565
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,760
How many, how many chapters is it going to be?

2566
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,760
12.

2567
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Okay, base.

2568
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,760
Unless, unless, unless I die, but also,

2569
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,760
but also if I managed to amouse enough interest

2570
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,760
towards like the middle of villain burst,

2571
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,760
I have, I know potential directions to kind of extend the story.

2572
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,760
Right.

2573
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,760
If not, whatever.

2574
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:35,760
But um, yeah, I also got like a lot of ideas for villain burst too.

2575
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,760
Like I would, I have an idea for a sequel,

2576
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,760
which would be more of a ongoing.

2577
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,760
It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be just 12 chapters.

2578
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,760
It'll be way longer.

2579
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,760
But um, that's it.

2580
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,760
I mean, that's if villain burst is like popular by the time, you know.

2581
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,760
Yeah.

2582
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,760
Yeah.

2583
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,760
Yeah.

2584
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,760
I mean, I just, I just want to finish it.

2585
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,760
Guess about it.

2586
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,760
Well, God bless you.

2587
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,760
God speed.

2588
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,760
You black emperor.

2589
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,760
Give us, give us connected again.

2590
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,760
Damn.

2591
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,760
What a piece.

2592
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:10,760
What a piece of shit.

2593
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,760
Should we, should we wait for her?

2594
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,760
No, fuck that.

2595
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,760
Uh, let's, let's, let's start it on voicemails.

2596
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,760
We've got a normal amount.

2597
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,760
We've got a normal amount of voicemails,

2598
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,760
which is to say like a million of them.

2599
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,760
I can't wait for all the circumcision ones.

2600
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,760
Oh boy.

2601
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,760
No, I'm sure we won't have a single one about that.

2602
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:39,760
Uh, this, this first one is called the green goblin lin or something.

2603
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,760
Three, two, one, go.

2604
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,760
Spider-Man.

2605
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,760
I see you falling into my trap.

2606
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,760
The choice mail.

2607
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,760
And this subway car was a, it's full of people.

2608
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:58,760
And this subway car has Mary Jane in it.

2609
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,760
And that's the choice.

2610
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,760
That's why it's the choice mail.

2611
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,760
So choose Spider-Man.

2612
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,760
That's, um...

2613
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,760
Do you guys remember when voicemails were good?

2614
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,760
No.

2615
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:19,760
Anyway, next, next voice mail is called Voice Whale.

2616
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,760
Voice Whale.

2617
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,760
Okay.

2618
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,760
Three, two, one, go.

2619
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,760
There it is.

2620
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,760
The tantalizing cry of the legendary voice whale.

2621
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,760
I don't know what I was expecting.

2622
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,760
I was like...

2623
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:43,760
It's better than the average one.

2624
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,760
Told you exactly what it was going to be and it was delivered.

2625
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,760
Yeah.

2626
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:51,760
Yeah, I guess, I guess I was the, I know, okay, that's the okay voice.

2627
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,760
I'll take it.

2628
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,760
I'll take it.

2629
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,760
Voice, Voice Whale for Voice Grail.

2630
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,760
Voice Whale for Voice Grail.

2631
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,760
Voice Whale for Voice Grail.

2632
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,760
The Grail Whale.

2633
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,760
I think, I think we got to put the Voice Whale in the Voice Grail.

2634
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:05,760
I'm doing it.

2635
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,760
I'm making it official.

2636
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,760
There he goes.

2637
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:08,760
There he goes.

2638
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,760
Perfect.

2639
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,760
Gib, you missed the Voice Whale.

2640
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,760
Gib, you're back.

2641
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,760
You missed the Voice Whale.

2642
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,760
But he's already ascended to the Grail, so, you know.

2643
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:16,760
Yeah.

2644
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:17,760
Yeah, it's the best.

2645
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,760
You're going to have to re-watch the episode just to hear this magistrate.

2646
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,760
Sad but true.

2647
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:27,760
Uh, next one is called, uh, You Suckers Didn't Hate It, Here's Another.

2648
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,760
Three, two, one, go.

2649
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:35,760
Hello, and welcome to part two of the Sucker of St. Benedict, The Need Who Could, by Elzon.

2650
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,760
But God, the mean old bastard just couldn't leave Ben alone in his cave.

2651
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,760
No, no, he just had to make a priest share his lunch with Ben in the middle of Easter.

2652
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,760
Also, some random shepherds found him.

2653
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:47,760
No.

2654
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,760
No.

2655
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:49,760
I do hate it.

2656
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,760
I'm sorry.

2657
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:51,760
I do hate it.

2658
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,760
It's not germane.

2659
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,760
It's not germane.

2660
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,760
Uh, I'm in no mood for this horseshit.

2661
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,760
Do you remember, you remember that one guy who did voicemails where he, um, he had like

2662
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,760
weird audio mixes and ended with like little mini songs about each member?

2663
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,760
Yeah.

2664
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:07,760
That guy was cool.

2665
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,760
I was pretty, those are the days.

2666
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,760
I'm tired of all these wannabe Riddle My Ass Batman types.

2667
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,760
Too bad we don't do that anymore.

2668
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,760
I disconnected for what seems like 40 minutes.

2669
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:25,760
Um, I just wanted to say, uh, that Cheesy, the things you were saying about art and working,

2670
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,760
were so similar to my own.

2671
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,760
That was basically entirely identical.

2672
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,760
And, uh, I forget what my train of thought was beyond that.

2673
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,760
I'm really annoyed that I've been gone this long.

2674
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,760
Sorry.

2675
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:40,760
It's okay.

2676
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,760
It's okay.

2677
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,760
Well, you got, you got my DMs again.

2678
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,760
We could still talk about, uh, this stuff.

2679
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,760
We're pals.

2680
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,760
Yeah.

2681
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,760
The best, the best tip was, uh, use, uh, the next chapter of One Piece as your, uh, as your,

2682
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,760
as your carrot.

2683
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,760
To beat you.

2684
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,760
Yeah.

2685
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,760
To doing things.

2686
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,760
I don't read One Piece when I'm making the comic, but once like I finish and it's on Gumroad,

2687
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,760
it's on Patreon, I'm like, all right, time to catch up on One Piece.

2688
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,760
Yeah.

2689
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,760
You, you reward yourself with something you like doing.

2690
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:12,760
I'm pretty sure villain versus gonna, pretty sure villain versus gonna end before like,

2691
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,760
uh, One Piece ends.

2692
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,760
Well, yeah.

2693
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,760
The universe will end before One Piece ends.

2694
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,760
Oh my God.

2695
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,760
In my opinion.

2696
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,760
I'm gonna have kids when One Piece ends.

2697
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,760
There's never gonna be a two piece.

2698
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,760
You're the final reward.

2699
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,760
Uh, okay.

2700
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:33,760
Next, next voicemail is called misogynist for trans rights.

2701
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,760
Three, two, one, go.

2702
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,760
I believe in trans rights, but also a strict binary.

2703
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:45,760
So to prove it, Ben, Tom, become trans because you, if you would support something, you'd

2704
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,760
do it also.

2705
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,760
Terrible.

2706
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,760
Can't catch me to the jail.

2707
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,760
Neal.

2708
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,760
I thought it was gonna be funny.

2709
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:57,760
Uh, I saw, I saw a tweet that was like, I don't know, the opposite is like the opposite

2710
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:08,760
of a turf is like a trans inclusionary misogynist, something misogynist, reactionary misogynist

2711
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,760
or something.

2712
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,760
Trans it like, so a femboy.

2713
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,760
A femboy.

2714
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,760
You better get off my turf.

2715
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:22,760
Does that, does that mean like, um, someone who, you know, like respects trans people's

2716
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:28,760
identities, but also is misogynistic against trans women in the same way they would be against

2717
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,760
cis women?

2718
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,760
Oh my God.

2719
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:31,760
Yes.

2720
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,760
I think I, I think I know.

2721
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,760
Oh my God.

2722
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,760
I have the perfect guy in mind for that, but I don't want to out him.

2723
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:41,760
I have a friend of mine sounds just like that description.

2724
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:46,760
Um, although he, although he does it in jest, he's not like an actual misogynist, but this,

2725
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,760
if it's perfectly what his brand, um, it's this guy called a yellow swag on Twitter.

2726
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,760
He's a cool guy, funny guy.

2727
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,760
Hey, fuck you, yellow swag.

2728
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:57,760
He's a cool guy, a friend of the show, yellow swag.

2729
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,760
Sounds like a major shed, if you ask me.

2730
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:02,760
He's, he's cool.

2731
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:03,760
He's a cool guy.

2732
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:04,760
He's mutual with stone toss.

2733
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,760
That's how you know he's base.

2734
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,760
Oh, I've heard of that guy.

2735
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,760
That's so cool.

2736
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,760
No, I just, actually, no, I'm not joking.

2737
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,760
I like stone.

2738
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,760
I like, uh, I was gonna say, I like stone.

2739
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,760
I love stone toss.

2740
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,760
I love stone toss.

2741
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,760
I'm a big stone toss fan.

2742
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,760
No, I, no, yellow swag studios is a cool guy.

2743
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,760
He did.

2744
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,760
He did.

2745
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:21,760
He did a cool guy.

2746
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,760
Stone toss made a kind of good comic the other day.

2747
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:24,760
He did.

2748
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:25,760
Oh.

2749
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,760
He actually did.

2750
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:27,760
What did he do?

2751
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:33,920
The comic was basically just the punchline is a guy works out and gets really buff to

2752
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,760
attract ladies, but ladies don't care, but gay guys like it.

2753
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,760
That was, that was it.

2754
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,760
That's pretty good.

2755
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,760
I think I'd seen that comic before.

2756
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,760
I, um, I was not new.

2757
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,760
Was it not a new one?

2758
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,760
Um, no, I mean, like I seen the joke done before.

2759
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,760
Maybe it's like the first time he's done it because I actually have it.

2760
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,760
It's not an incredibly original.

2761
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,760
It sounds like the story to my life.

2762
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,760
It's perfectly fine.

2763
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:02,760
And knowing stone toss, the punchline is, oh, how horrible gays are now attracted to

2764
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:03,760
this person.

2765
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,440
How unfortunate for them.

2766
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,440
In other comics.

2767
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:08,440
Yes.

2768
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:12,440
In this comic, there was no, there was the gate, the guys just look normal.

2769
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,440
I mean, sometimes like, you know, I mean, that's how it works.

2770
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,440
Right.

2771
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:18,360
You know, you got to throw in someone, just a straightforward joke, you know, so once

2772
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:22,440
people like the straightforward joke, they get a red pill by the other jokes.

2773
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,440
Right.

2774
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,440
Yeah.

2775
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,440
Yeah.

2776
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,440
That's true.

2777
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,440
I mean, there wasn't one point where I was like up to the, on every stone toss, like

2778
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,440
a comic, like I read each one of them.

2779
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,440
Cause I was fine.

2780
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,440
I was fine to do a video.

2781
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,440
A video.

2782
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,440
Yeah.

2783
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,440
Religious followers.

2784
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:41,440
But I think even if you disagree with his messages, his comics are sometimes pretty funny.

2785
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:45,440
Oh, I mean, they're very well, they're very well crafted.

2786
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,440
I mean, I understand.

2787
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:48,440
He's very good at what he does.

2788
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:52,440
Like I read all of them cause I wanted to talk, I wanted to make a video talking about

2789
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,440
how he does it.

2790
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,440
So like lefties, like know what to do.

2791
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,440
But basically.

2792
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,440
Thoughts like I'm already made that video.

2793
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,440
No, but I'll do it, but I'm a comic artist.

2794
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:03,440
Yeah.

2795
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,440
And he's a little bit more valid.

2796
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,440
Yeah.

2797
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:07,440
Obviously you could do it again.

2798
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:12,440
No, but also, but I'd also like would draw like my own version of a stone toss comic

2799
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:17,440
and I kind of have, I mean, I'll just tell you guys it'd be, it'd be the first frame,

2800
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:23,440
the first panel would, would be like his little version of how he draws a trans person.

2801
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:28,440
And then there'd be like a, there would be a guy next to him who's like the smug little

2802
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:29,440
racist guy.

2803
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,440
And on his shirt, it's the, it's the, it's the acronym for it's okay to be white is on

2804
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,440
a shirt, right?

2805
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,440
And, and the guy would say like, isn't it obvious?

2806
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:42,440
And then this panel too, he'd be like, your identity is killing you.

2807
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:46,440
And then it's that it's the mean number of like the trans suicide rates, which isn't real

2808
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,440
by the way.

2809
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,440
That's like not accurate at all.

2810
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:56,440
Like the, was it 41% yeah, it would be 41% right above the trans person, right?

2811
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:01,440
But then in panel three, the trans person is like looking at, at the other guy.

2812
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:06,440
And then in panel four, the punchline is that right above the other guy, there is a 68%.

2813
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:07,440
Right?

2814
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,440
I don't get it.

2815
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,440
Okay.

2816
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:14,440
Because the thing is that, that white boys have like a higher suicide rate.

2817
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,440
That's like 68%.

2818
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:21,440
And I think there was an article explaining how like white, white boys have a 68% suicide

2819
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,440
rate.

2820
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,440
Yes.

2821
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,440
That seems, it can't, it can't be true.

2822
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,440
I'm probably misquoting it.

2823
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,440
I'm probably misquoting it, but I think I was going to talk, I was going to talk about

2824
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:35,440
that in my video, how like you have to kind of lie too, if you want to make a stone toss

2825
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:36,440
coming.

2826
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:37,440
Oh yeah.

2827
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:39,440
This is supposed to be sad.

2828
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:44,440
I swear, I swear it's like, no, but it was like a 68% or something.

2829
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,440
Not like saying like.

2830
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,440
I don't think 68% of white people kill themselves.

2831
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,440
No, I don't think it's, I don't think it's specifically white people.

2832
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,440
I think it's specifically like white males.

2833
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:56,440
I don't think that's true either.

2834
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:57,440
You don't think that's true?

2835
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:58,440
No.

2836
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,440
I don't have the stats on any of this though.

2837
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,440
I can't, I can't say whether it's true or not.

2838
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,440
It seems like an outrageously high number of people.

2839
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,440
This sounds a little bit high though.

2840
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:12,440
That would mean, that would mean that suicide kills more people than everything else combined.

2841
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,440
More white men than everything else combined.

2842
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,440
And I'm sure that it doesn't.

2843
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,440
Hold up.

2844
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,440
Well, I could be misquoting that.

2845
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,440
There could be other shit that like I'm talking about.

2846
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,440
Oh it's 69%.

2847
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,440
White males account for.

2848
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,440
Hold up.

2849
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,440
Suicides is from.

2850
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:29,440
They account for 69% of suicides.

2851
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,440
It's not 69% of them commit suicide.

2852
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,440
That's like a different, okay.

2853
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,440
I mean, I was assuming I misquoted this.

2854
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,440
I assume I misquoted the statistic, right?

2855
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,440
Right.

2856
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,440
Exactly.

2857
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,440
Yeah, I see.

2858
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:47,440
But what I'm saying is that like, you know, you kind of like, when you do a stone toss,

2859
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:51,440
like he's not, he's not quoting that percentage like accurately, right?

2860
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,440
Yeah.

2861
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:53,440
Just like I didn't.

2862
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:54,440
The point isn't the, yeah.

2863
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,440
Okay.

2864
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,440
I get it.

2865
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,440
The point is not to be honest.

2866
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,440
The point is to.

2867
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:01,440
Is to have those kind of like quick snappy like.

2868
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,440
The thing is, a lot of people are not smart enough to understand satire.

2869
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:10,440
So they're going to just think you're legitimately making that point.

2870
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:14,440
Uh, but it's true.

2871
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,440
No, but it's true as far as I'm aware.

2872
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:21,440
I mean, the logic with the whole trans suicide rate joke is that, oh,

2873
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:24,440
we shouldn't help trans people because they just end up killing themselves.

2874
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:25,440
Right.

2875
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,440
Which is really fucking stupid logic.

2876
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:31,440
So it's kind of like, oh, if you think that, then we probably shouldn't help like white boys

2877
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:36,440
because they're also killing themselves like by a higher number technically.

2878
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:39,440
I, I know that there's no point.

2879
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:43,440
I know, I know that we've already agreed that the statistic is not.

2880
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:44,440
Okay.

2881
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:49,440
I keep wanting to argue it even though I know that's not the point.

2882
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,440
Uh, yes, I understand.

2883
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,440
I understand what you're saying.

2884
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,440
Yeah.

2885
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,440
Got it.

2886
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:55,440
Got it.

2887
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,440
Guys, I don't, I don't hate white people.

2888
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:00,440
I feel like, I feel like it would require a citation needed.

2889
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:02,440
You would have to have like a little like hyperlink under.

2890
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:05,440
It's like, here's the, here's the study that this is referencing.

2891
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,440
He sometimes does that.

2892
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:12,440
You know, we ever seen him do that once when he did a comic about circumcision.

2893
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:13,440
Nice.

2894
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:18,440
But I'm pretty, but I'm pretty sure what he was like, um, linking was like a documentary

2895
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:22,440
that did, cause like when stone toss like does a circumcision thing.

2896
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:27,440
He like, he, he, he specifically likes to blame women and Jews.

2897
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,440
Right.

2898
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:30,440
Like that's the, that's the only people he blamed for circumcision.

2899
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:31,440
Same.

2900
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,440
Same.

2901
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:35,440
But that's like, that's like the M.O.

2902
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,440
Right.

2903
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,440
Why?

2904
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,440
Why women?

2905
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,440
Cause he hates women.

2906
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,440
Oh, okay.

2907
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:41,440
I guess that, I guess that.

2908
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:45,440
I mean, like, if you're, I mean, if you're a Nazi, you're most likely also a misogynist,

2909
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,440
you know, it's, it comes with, it's like a package a deal, you know.

2910
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:49,440
Okay.

2911
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,440
Yeah.

2912
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,440
You know, I was, you know what, I don't, I don't need an explanation.

2913
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,440
I really, I really don't.

2914
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,440
Uh, uh, uh, it's just, yeah.

2915
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,440
All right.

2916
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,440
Got it.

2917
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:01,440
All right.

2918
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,440
Nice.

2919
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:04,440
I don't even remember what we're talking about.

2920
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,440
So let's move on.

2921
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,440
So let's move on to the next one.

2922
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,440
Uh, this one is called the last zoomer.

2923
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,440
Three, two, one, go.

2924
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,440
Here my plea.

2925
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,440
And let me talk on the boomer.

2926
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,440
Ben saying.

2927
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,440
That didn't, that didn't rhyme.

2928
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:53,440
I think the lack of rhyme at the end was for emphasis.

2929
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:57,440
I think it was done deliberately and I think it was masterfully executed.

2930
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,440
I guess it was supposed to make me mad.

2931
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:00,440
You don't get it.

2932
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,440
You were supposed to make you mad.

2933
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:07,440
As far as I know, uh, Ben really hates it when people call him boomer.

2934
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:12,440
I, I, I, I, I hate it when people say it and mean it.

2935
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:15,440
Someone called me boomer.

2936
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,440
I got to stop them and was like, wait, do you mean that?

2937
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,440
I, I hate it when people genuinely don't know.

2938
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,440
When, when, when, when I get, when someone calls me a boomer without the

2939
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:29,440
knowledge that actually I am in fact a millennial, uh, I get frustrated

2940
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,440
because we are, we're not the same.

2941
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:32,440
Me and them are not.

2942
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:36,440
The only true boomer is boomer co-anger from mega men X.

2943
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,440
Nice.

2944
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,440
Boomer co-anger at least.

2945
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,440
I love that guy.

2946
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,440
Never ate lead paint.

2947
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,440
You know, he's just made of lead.

2948
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:46,440
Did, did you eat lead paint, Ben?

2949
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:48,440
No, the boomers did.

2950
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:51,440
So they've all got lead poisoning and have no empathy.

2951
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,440
Word, word.

2952
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:56,440
I think the only boomer I like is, um, a Stereo's coconut.

2953
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,440
He's a pretty funny guy.

2954
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:00,440
He's, he's Gen X.

2955
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,440
God damn it.

2956
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:05,440
I sent him a free copy of Villainverse and he hasn't read it yet.

2957
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,440
Stereo's coconut is supposed, has been, I've been supposed to go on a

2958
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,440
Crystery podcast for like a year now.

2959
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,440
And it's just, uh, I'm just, I'm just waiting on that call.

2960
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,440
I'm just waiting on that DM.

2961
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:21,440
Why don't you invite him to the PCP?

2962
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,440
Hmm.

2963
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:25,440
Invite Stereo's.

2964
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,440
We could invite him.

2965
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,440
We could, I guess we could invite a Stereo's.

2966
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,440
Word.

2967
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,440
Uh, but Ben.

2968
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,440
You guys could do that.

2969
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:38,440
There was a tweet where a Stereo's tagged the drunken peasants and you in

2970
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,440
response to something about Nick Fuentes.

2971
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:43,440
What was that about?

2972
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,440
I was confused.

2973
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,440
Yeah.

2974
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:51,440
Let me, um, I remember the one you're talking about.

2975
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:57,440
Uh, was it in response to a rational disconnect tweet about how Fuentes was

2976
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:00,440
malding about not being invited on the Timcast?

2977
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:01,440
Yeah.

2978
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,440
Yeah.

2979
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,440
Yeah.

2980
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:06,440
Someone replied, someone replied with that image of a discord post that I had

2981
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,440
seen before.

2982
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:12,440
And actually, like a week ago, I was thinking of that exact image because I

2983
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:16,440
saw a post from Fuentes that sucked because everything that Fuentes says

2984
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,440
sucks.

2985
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:21,440
And I wanted to post, and I just wanted to post that image in response of just

2986
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:26,440
this guy explaining what a fucking loser, uh, Fuentes isn't always has been.

2987
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,440
I didn't have the image.

2988
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,440
How about that discord like message thing?

2989
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,440
Yeah.

2990
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:34,440
The one that the guy just describes like how he knew.

2991
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,440
Yeah.

2992
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:38,440
Shit his pants and like what a, what a turdy is in high school and how now he

2993
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:42,440
just, he spends his free time harassing the church that lived across the street

2994
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,440
from his parents house.

2995
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,440
Um, and, uh, yeah.

2996
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:52,440
A Stereo's tagged me and the drunken peasants and some other guy.

2997
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:56,440
And I don't know why he tagged those people specifically, but I appreciated

2998
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:57,440
it.

2999
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:00,440
Well, the drunken peasants like actively shit on Nick Fuentes all the time.

3000
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:02,440
Actually, like, well, good for them.

3001
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:06,440
Actually, last, the last episode they uploaded is how I found out about that

3002
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:09,440
whole discord message and him shitting his pants.

3003
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,440
Um, yeah.

3004
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,440
Uh, the drunk peasants are pretty cool.

3005
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,440
Pretty cool guys.

3006
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,440
I want to get on that eventually.

3007
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,440
Hopefully I get enough clout that I could appear.

3008
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,440
Uh, I'll go on any fucking podcast.

3009
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,440
I went on shredded.

3010
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,440
Nobody knows about shredded.

3011
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,440
Yeah.

3012
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,440
Ben is real desperate to go on anything.

3013
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,440
I'll do anything for clout.

3014
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,440
Yeah.

3015
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:32,440
Anything.

3016
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,440
Yeah.

3017
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,440
Ben, I heard rumors that then voted for Biden.

3018
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:39,440
So, you know, he has no morals.

3019
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,440
I voted for Howie Hawkins.

3020
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,440
2020.

3021
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:44,440
I voted for Jojo.

3022
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:45,440
Joe Jorgensen.

3023
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,440
God bless America.

3024

Ness voicemail is called advice three, two, one, go,

02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,540
더.

3059
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:42,540
No.

3060
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,940
It's kind of a little unnecessary at the end, that was little unreal.

3061
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:45,940
I have.

3062
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:54,100
I like how short all of them are now that's true a blessing in disguise I the

3063
02:05:54,100 --> 02:06:00,220
short ones I've noticed are the ones with the slurs so far so far yeah that's

3064
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:04,500
true I mean to get I guess the game plan is like you say the slur then leave

3065
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:11,500
right you don't want to stay yeah exactly that's the tactical in and out I

3066
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:18,340
tactically use my slurs next one is called this one is called

3067
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:24,460
flupidy doopidy zim zam zoop three two one go

3068
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:33,420
on the tube oh my god this is I summer I saw yes I listen to a podocast when I

3069
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:42,700
send off two message second message you say is that a samurai yes it is a

3070
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:51,540
samurai this is what I talk about when braze rarix hard to grow up and do a

3071
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:57,700
samurai voice you're cracking was all dysphoria you're cracking but for

3072
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:10,260
anyway Ben no son you apologize you apologize now after steel scroll you

3073
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:21,260
now say sorry well summer a foggy oh good all is a foggy one Ben no son no

3074
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:30,620
want to scroll if for you sorry it okay but oh Ben no son you cause of summer a

3075
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:40,980
father to commit or set a code and for that I shall not be forgiven but until

3076
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:48,060
next time I think her father that they said something about gender in a past

3077
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:53,460
thing and then they said dysphoria this time I think I think yes samurai might

3078
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:59,620
be struggling to maintain their voice while also transitioning which is that's

3079
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:05,660
correct these are these are the two bits that I put together oh god should I do

3080

it should I say should I say sorry should I say sorry so Louis I see the

3081
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:16,460
scroll you know this this person clearly puts a lot of effort into their samurai

3082
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:21,820
samurai had his arc alright samurai came and went and you know what I think he

3083
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:26,660
had he had his moment of redemption so I think I think he deserves closure all

3084
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:34,860
right I'm gonna do it all right I'm gonna fucking do it Sam samurai sama I am I

02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:22,820
a little bit too smart that actually is it's it's orange okay can I go now if a

3102
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:28,300
tree falls in the woods then how many times did I fuck your wife wood would

02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:47,660
I hate and loath said that to me I would say what's so rude why would you even

3106
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:52,700
say why would you why would you disrespect my wife son that way I do not

3107
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:58,180
respect you at all my wife son is listening he can hear you my wife son is

3108
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:01,900
a fan and I don't want him going and swearing at the neighbor's house when

3109
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:06,940
he's playing video games because then I'll have to beat him and then and then

3110
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:15,020
crush him under a felled tree and then smoke weed and then I'll punish him more

3111
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:18,460
for smoking we I don't fucking know just call you callbacks to everything just

3112
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:23,100
just hey at this point in the podcast instead of us doing callbacks just stop

3113
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:29,140
the podcast go back to the beginning and listen to it again consider it all just

3114
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:34,380
and you're like oh that's a callback oh that's a callback to the first frame of

3115
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:37,740
the video is a callback to the first frame of the video oh the first time I

3116
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:41,700
listened to it was just foreshadowing for the second time

3117
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:44,780
it's obviously way funnier the second time around

3118
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:50,380
obviously obviously go and repeat you should go back to the part where I

3119
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:54,140
promote villain verse so I don't have to promote at the end again you should

3120
02:11:54,140 --> 02:12:00,980
skip over the part where I'm racist wait what Ben was racist what was that

3121
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:06,380
time-staff now next voicemail next voicemail ha ha ha the next one is called

3122
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:17,860
an answer oh my god we're gonna find out okay three two one go fall colors good

3123
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:24,620
one okay so I wouldn't have thought of that because of autumn being the word yeah

3124
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:30,940
I wait yeah you know I made a joke like this one it's winter isn't it no but

3125
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:37,660
like I guess it's a pun yeah but a tree a tree doesn't always fall in the

3126
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:42,860
autumn it can fall at any time I guess I guess but the joke is that the tree is

3127
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:50,180
falling therefore it's fall colors yeah pretty much it's not about you're

3128
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:54,020
thinking about this too rationally I mean I would assume he there's a lot of

3129
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:59,740
information he didn't disclose just imagine you're watching one of my videos

3130
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:07,740
yeah yeah you know like what he's gonna say like oh my god it should have been

3131
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:11,860
it should have been if a fall if a tree falls in the woods what time of year is

3132
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:17,180
it I mean that's a bit too obvious it's too obvious for you because this is the

3133
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:23,540
same word shut up my my god my god no the joke's fine it's a good joke no it's

3134
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:32,780
not it's a good joke mr. mr. riddle sir it's it sucks defend yourself he's a

3135
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:37,580
good joke this guy he's a riddle a riddle lure if you will he does he does

3136
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:48,380
him a lot hmm next one is called PCP website oh boy three two one go yeah I

3137
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:53,300
just want to know if the procrastinators.com oh the procrastinators

3138
02:13:53,300 --> 02:14:00,780
podcast.com is that your guys's website because if so it looks so shit it looks

3139
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:10,020
so garbage yeah it is that's the most basic looking template ass website I've

3140
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:17,100
ever seen if that is not you guys whoever runs that needs to clean their

3141
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:24,580
shit up I'd rather have like a basic ass HTML a tag fucking garbage website than

3142
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:31,860
like this basic template shit clean this shit up if it is you guys I know you

3143
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:37,260
know how to do graphic design because all your other websites look fine so what

3144
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:41,420
the fuck's going on looking and I'm seeing that cactus and frankly I don't

3145
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:46,940
know I love that cactus if we change all right that we first of all that is

3146
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:50,500
our website second of all the point of the website is just so that we can

3147
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:54,300
host it on iTunes we didn't think we didn't bother to like put any effort

3148
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:58,340
into designing it in any way and third of all what the fuck's wrong with it it's

3149
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:03,620
fine it's just a list of the episodes like like it doesn't need to be it

3150
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:06,900
doesn't need to be anything more than this

3151
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:12,100
honestly I think the only thing wrong with it is just that the image is a

3152
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:18,020
stock image and not like PCP branding true we could change the one thing but

3153
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:21,700
like that is bad about the template the template it just looks like a normal

3154
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:26,580
template web but I think you're gonna see what's wrong with a template you work

3155
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:30,820
for us right here I think this person this person doesn't like that it's

3156
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:34,100
boilerplate but like it's boilerplate on purpose it doesn't have to be maybe

3157
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,740
you should get me to make one for you

3158
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:44,180
hold on let me go to is it gamers tavern.com or the gamers just gamers

3159
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:52,100
tavern.com gamers you know I recently installed an SSL certificate which was

3160
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:56,580
pretty difficult and costed me some money but now it's finally secure a

3161
02:15:56,580 --> 02:16:09,740
connection a lot of brown a lot of brown let's check on articles okay yeah text

3162
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:15,420
articles check out the news okay there we go a feed feed going back to 2018 oh

3163
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:22,060
no it goes back for even that there's not a single podcast on this website how

3164
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:28,380
are we supposed how how can we possibly host it I didn't say I would host it I

3165
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:35,260
just mean I meant I could make you a website for you our website is immaculate

3166
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:42,140
our website is perfect it has function I mean I time immemorial I feel like you

3167
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:47,580
know having a website and like making it your own and doing like a unique design

3168
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:54,260
for it is is cute and cool and based and I don't knock that sort of thing I

3169
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:59,500
just feel like yeah if you have no intention to run it there's no reason

3170
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:05,500
for it to not be a template like it's just there yeah to to be the website

3171
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:11,940
version of the archive yeah it gets it gets the job done we are not there's no

3172
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:18,660
way people will find the podcast through the website you know I keep thinking

3173
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:24,540
speaking of branding speaking of PCP branded banners and imagery I keep

3174
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:28,780
thinking about changing our branding like our branding is fucked up now it's

3175
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:33,540
it's like it's wrong I hate it I hate that every episode starts with the wheel

3176
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:41,340
with with nine of us when there's literally like four of us now if that I

3177
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:45,340
keep thinking about changing it but it's like it's like a it's like kind of a

3178
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:51,180
big project and I don't know what I would want to do with it um new kind what

3206
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:04,100

3207
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:08,860
to the fact that she used to write like erotic fucking transformers slash fiction

3208
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:15,900
that's like the funniest shit I've ever she she really did that well she she

3209
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:20,740
um she loves star screen it's a plot it's a she she mentioned she mentioned in

3210
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:25,500
like one of the latest videos okay she definitely wrote fanfiction and she was

3211
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:31,380
in the transformers community and like come on look at her look at her you know

3212
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:35,180

3225
02:22:57,980 --> 02:23:01,940
question about relationships don't I think we haven't had one of those in one

3226
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:08,300
oh boy but yeah it's not the cringiest question is not should I maybe talk to

3228
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:21,740
you fuck anyone but it was short you just so I don't really know what to expect

3229
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:27,060
of a relationship and I think most of the stuff I was no fucking guide but just

3230
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:32,660
do whatever you want to do friends like not in their face this is so funny yeah

3231
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:37,380
thoughts that's a fun it's a funny question yeah did you yeah there is no

3232
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:44,420
answer you just like like it's it's it's like you do what you want to do and

3233
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:47,180
what they want to do and you see what you both want to do and then you do it is

3234
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:51,580
usually sex do you um do you see my profile picture and there's like a

3235

little plush version of pasta the clown oh yeah I see oh yeah yeah that was no

3236
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:05,100

3237
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:10,300
um basically that was made by my partner so you know you can make plushes for

3238
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:15,220
your in your relationship you know see what I don't you need to do is you need

3239
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:21,660
to go and compliment your girlfriend say I like the yellow in your eyes and then

3240
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:27,700
you'll say thanks that's due to complications from my hepatitis C

3241
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:34,740
hell yeah that will get that will get a dialogue going you know you look like

3242
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:42,260
you've seen a ghost picture oh this is a nice this looks this is actually based

3243
02:24:42,260 --> 02:24:46,940
on a music video from one of my favorite artists and I actually added him when I

3244
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:52,660
made um when I made this picture and he retweeted he's a cool guy his name is

3245
02:24:52,660 --> 02:24:58,380
funder cat just look at that you don't have to watch the video just look at the

3246
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:02,340
video the thumbnail the thumbnail the background looks a little bit like

3247
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:07,580
Lisa the first it looks like a one of those backgrounds from earthbound

3248
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:13,300
earthbound yeah yeah the background was made by my friend pug ugly he's a cool

3249
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:19,340
guy I started the video and it looks the same as the phone yeah exactly that's

3250
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:22,420
that's why I said you don't have to watch the video you just look at the thumbnail

3251
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:26,420
that's what it's based on I like I like making my profile pictures based off of

3252
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:31,820
like album covers or like anything kind of music related my profile picture before

3253
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:37,740
this one was based on a title the creator album cover man I was I was tempted

3254
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:43,380
the other day to change my Twitter avatar oh you know what I'm watching I

3255
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:47,180

3259
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:08,300
exactly like we should commission someone to make it a little bit closer to

3260
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:12,780

artist no thanks okay look I oh my god I only made one circumcision joke you

3263
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:28,780

3264
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:37,660
here the next next voicemail is called cross bad way to wake up falling off a

3265
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:42,420
bunk bed three two one go

3266
02:26:53,420 --> 02:26:59,540
voice grail wait to get out of your bed in the morning that kind of reminds me

3267
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:05,900
of I think cross is in voice jail I think he's he's got out I guess he's out

3268
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:12,140
that was funny he just fell out of bed this this kind of reminds me of the

3269
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:16,940
video alien misfortune it's only like a seven second video but it's kind of

3270
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:22,820
literally that aliens okay three two one go oh it's psychic pebbles yeah

3271
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:37,060
aliens misfortune yep what a damn shame for that blue boy alright next one is

3272
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:44,340
called always like me some psychic pebbles it's just called a mozilla

3273
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:53,420
named after his author one assumes three two one go so Ellen Page has

3274
02:27:53,420 --> 02:27:57,780
transitioned into Elliot Page and I think that's pretty fucking dope but

3275
02:27:57,780 --> 02:28:03,020
therein lies a problem I've made for myself I've dead named this person using

3276
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:07,900
the name that they've left behind but what I want to know is and I mean this

3277
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:11,860
with no disrespect I fully support trans rights I love what Elliot is doing at

3278
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:17,740
I just want to know like how do we go about talking about people in the past

3279
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:23,540
tense from when they used their former name like Elliot it will be Elliot going

3280
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:28,260
forward no debate anyone who disagrees and is like they're always going to be

3281
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:32,660
Ellen to me and their women like these people should be burned alive by fire

3282
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:39,740
but their former name is engraved in our culture you know they still exist in

3283
02:28:39,740 --> 02:28:43,340
the past and I think that just because you change your name change your

3284
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:48,620
identity it doesn't mean that that past version is erased is it wrong to think

3285
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:54,020
that way and if so first of all I apologize and also how can this dilemma

3286
02:28:54,020 --> 02:29:00,580
be solved I know from people who know way more about this than me doesn't um I

3287
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:08,020
mean okay it's a small dilemma but like I think that the reason you would you

3288
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:13,700
would refrain from using their old name is on the off chance that they would hear

3289
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:18,700
it and like I don't know they don't like to hear it yeah it's not that is

3290
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:25,180
incorrect it's just that it's like potentially upsetting I'm pretty sure

3291
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:32,420
I'm pretty sure that like by and large most people who transition want you want

3292
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:38,420
you to refer to them by their new name even retroactively like pretty sure

3293
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:45,740
that's generally the the the thing like the I think the only one okay I don't

3294
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:50,180
know if this is even is like a good example like Chris Chan is a weird

3295
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:56,580
example because she literally like refers to her past pre-transition self as

3296
02:29:56,580 --> 02:30:02,020
like a male and like a different person so but she's like the only one that I

3297
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:07,180
didn't like con contrapoints doesn't didn't didn't she say one time that like

3298
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:10,220
she doesn't consider herself to have always been a woman she considered

3299
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:14,340
herself to have been a man who became a woman but she still goes by Natalie she

3300
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:19,140
doesn't refer to old self as I guess I don't even remember what what her old

3301
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:23,700
name was depends on the person I think it depends on the person I think I

3302
02:30:24,700 --> 02:30:32,100
mind yeah seems like the most most people say just use the new name I think

3303
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:38,180
yeah yeah but I think in the case of a celebrity it's gonna be kind of impossible

3304
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:42,300
to get away from your old identity because of how popular you are in pop

3305
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:46,740
culture yeah I mean that's still be listed on old movies with the old name

3306
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:50,740
and what can you do what a lot of news articles I've been doing that I kind of

3307
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:56,940
appreciate is like they'll say like former star of Juno or star or star of

3308
02:30:56,940 --> 02:31:03,540
umbrella Academy yeah I mean you can say now it's not it's not wrong to say like

3309
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:08,820
it's not wrong to say like Elliot Page formerly known as Ellen Page right like

3310
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:13,020
that's it's not about it being wrong it's I really think it's just about that

3311
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:17,340
because when it's on a smaller scale with a person like a personal friend you

3312
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:22,980
wouldn't talk to them and X like toy like use the the old name for fear that

3313
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:27,020
they would not appreciate it when it's a famous person it is a little bit

3314
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:30,340
different but I don't think like if you're interviewing them you don't need

3315
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:35,180
to use the old name necessarily and it would it would be kind of maybe kind of

3316
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:41,100
rude depending on the person that they are I think as a general rule you

3317
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:47,300
should try not to just because it'll be easier to for people to get used to the

3318
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:53,660
new the new name but for historical purposes when you're talking about the

3319
02:31:53,660 --> 02:32:05,580
actors from a film I don't know like it's as long as it's not overtly

3320
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:10,420
confusing I don't think it should be too difficult to to retroactively use the

3321
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:16,420
new name unless the like if Ellen at the time started with a person who was called

3322
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:22,360
Elliot and then you talk about the film and you say Elliot who's who you're

3323
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:30,260
talking about that that's maybe a thing but yeah so I mean it seems like use the

3324
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:35,340
use the new name unless there's some like specific reason not to unless you

3325
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:39,580
need to you need to bring up the old name for some like specific purpose there

3326
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:44,020
might be like little niche like little moments where you're gonna have to but

3327
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:48,520
like that's probably be incredibly rare I mean I don't know how actively you all

3328
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:54,380
be watching umbrella Academy or like Juno or all the other classic Elliot page I've

3329
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:59,300
never seen I've never I've never seen anything that Elliot has ever been in

3330
02:32:59,300 --> 02:33:04,460
that's to my to my knowledge not even Juno I've never no I've never seen Juno

3331
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:12,820
Juno is literally the papers the movie really no okay I mean it could be I

3332
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:19,500
haven't seen it in a while it's Vapors for the movie yes nice yeah Magda gets

3333
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:28,300
pregnant by Vincent that's a fucked up she gets like quote-unquote pregnant

3334
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:32,380
it's actually like a stuffed toy she shoves up her shirt and people think

3335
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:38,500
she's vagina oh wow what a what a lion can't I can't believe it

3336
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:47,020
well I think she gets a big poobah she poops out a poobah child that could be

3337
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:53,100
like I could be a dream sequence that could be that could be illegal that

3338
02:33:53,100 --> 02:34:01,540
could be erased from living memory hey I think I've just remembered that have you

3339
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:06,660
seen I don't know whether you would have but there's this this I don't know what

3340
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:11,700
you would call it I guess it's a dojin and it's mostly safe for work but it's

3341
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:17,060
basically the the tale of this person who is literally Vincent from the Vapors

3342
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:22,780
who is like a spoiled rich kid and this maid who is a lot taller than him and he

3343
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:28,180
gets mad at about her being tall and treats her like shit and I know where

3344
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:33,940
this is going and she she like she's continues growing because she's like

3345
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:37,140
having gross births and it's like hi that's a fetish thing it's like really

3346
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:42,300
tall like three meters tall he's like one meter something or other and he gets

3347
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:46,900
he thinks that stupid woman she she can't beat me I'm the coolest guy ever

3348
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:52,860

3350
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:05,540
Vincent's not a rich kid well he looks it's just how he looks and his attitude

02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:12,340

praising it because he's very in for you were in your episode your sleep and I

3391
02:39:06,940 --> 02:39:11,620
think I come up for a nice segment why the shit is good because you know when

3392
02:39:11,620 --> 02:39:18,980
you use when you construct a phrase use words word that existed before but what

3393
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:23,380
is of most value is the meaning of the phrase what you're coming up that's new

3394
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:33,180
even if what you're using are old century old words okay so what it evokes the

3395
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:38,900
meaning evokes when the choreography is used in Steven University initially brings

3396
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:45,140
your mind the things of no devotion and gender that is in Newton yes and it is

3397
02:39:45,140 --> 02:39:50,740
specifically meaningful for the character and the episode and and it's good I

3398
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:56,860
and that was my point I understand good to be smart I don't I don't agree with

3399
02:39:56,860 --> 02:40:05,380
that like equating using words that have already existed to using a shot for

3400
02:40:05,380 --> 02:40:11,740
shot like scene choreography for like a like an animated bit because you don't

3401
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:17,820
use those as words that's just a reference okay that I think I think he

3402
02:40:17,860 --> 02:40:22,860
said that as like an analogy and I think it I kind of understand that I think his

3403
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:29,780
main point was that using the scene you know not not parodying but basically

3404
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:37,140
recreating the uttina scene is like shorthand to evoke all the all the

3405
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:42,740
emotions and the feelings and stuff that one would associate with uttina which is

3406
02:40:42,740 --> 02:40:46,260
true I haven't seen but I don't but I don't really think I don't really think

3407
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:50,340
that was the intent of that scene and I yeah I don't think they expected that

3408
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:57,420
like most people watching Steven Universe would have seen uttina and like know

3409
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:01,180
what that is and have those emotions come I think I kind of think it was just

3410
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:04,980
like a reference for reference sake I mean it's not gonna be cool like oh we

3411
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:08,660
like this anime let's reference it in our show cuz we like yeah I mean I I think

3412
02:41:08,660 --> 02:41:11,860
that what he's saying a references I think that what he's describing you can

3413
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:14,740
do that with a reference but I don't think that's what this one was doing I

3414
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:19,780
don't I remember the argument being that you you just thought that it wasn't it

3415
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:23,180
like you thought it was cool that Steven Universe had that bit of animation but

3416
02:41:23,180 --> 02:41:26,540
when you found out that it was a reference it felt less interesting and

3417
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:31,700
then other people the others were trying to argue I thought it was a cool I

3418
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:35,100
thought it was a cool looking scene but then when I found out that it was just

3419
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:39,100
copied from somewhere else I was like oh well I'm not that impressed because they

3420
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:43,100
didn't come up with it wasn't it that you were arguing that it's more better to

3421
02:41:43,100 --> 02:41:47,660
come up with something original than to make a reference yeah eventually

3422
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:52,420
eventually I did we did kind of break it down to the point that I just think

3423
02:41:52,420 --> 02:41:58,020
that being original makes a thing better even if all everything else is to me it

3424
02:41:58,020 --> 02:42:04,260
just depends yeah I think it depends as well but in that one I'm saying all

3425
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:09,820
other all everything all else being the same an original thing is better just by

3426
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:13,500
virtue of being original I still I still isn't everything just copied from

3427
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:19,460
somewhere else isn't isn't just villain versus the bad guys club

3428
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:24,820
actually there's no story in bad guys club is they're just characters they

3429
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:31,260
have no story but um yeah I don't think you can like like you can argue that a

3430
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:38,380
reference is like never as good as something if you if you do say like all

3431
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:42,300
else being the same you're basically talking about the reference and the

3432
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:47,660
original and which one is better and I don't even know whether that's what's

3433
02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:51,220
like okay obviously it's an imperfect comparison yeah obviously there will

3434
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:54,820
never be a case where one thing is original and another thing is is

3435
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:58,180
derivative but they're the same because that doesn't make any sense one of them

3436
02:42:58,180 --> 02:43:03,500
had to come first I don't I think isn't like a lot of the media you like Ben is

3437
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:08,260
like oh this pre-existing character but they're doing something they're not so

3438
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:12,260
supposed to be doing is it not like a lot of what you dig what the fuck are you

3439
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:18,740
talking about like tails get strong show good strong mr. boo oh god damn you're

3440
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:23,500
absolutely right oh my god you do you do like that like oh pre-existing character

3441
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:28,380
but they're not supposed to be doing this guys well in that like yeah in in

3442
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:35,340
those contexts I think that you do carry over the whole cultural cachet of like

3443
02:43:35,620 --> 02:43:41,700
Pac-Man you bring him into the story and it and it brings something to it to a

3444
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:51,380
deliberate effect or maybe not deliberate but to a specific effect I mean okay so

3445
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:56,100
like to make it the story of those gets trolled could not be told it just couldn't

3446
02:43:56,100 --> 02:43:59,700
it wouldn't be the same without those that those stolen characters I mean I

3447
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:06,580
agree yeah could I make a distinction would it be like Pac-Man the character

3448
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:15,180
being in a comic versus a reference to how Pac-Man dies going like that yeah

3449
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:20,060
like that being the reference used that would be like it's an unoriginal thing

3450
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:30,740
versus Pac-Man literally being in there I mean I think that like that's so like yeah

3451
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:35,260
no what I'm trying to get at is like there's a difference between referencing

3452
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:42,940
something and using something that already exists because then the argument

3453
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:51,780
of a references like is it is it better is it better than the original or like

3454
02:44:51,780 --> 02:44:55,900
would it be better if it was its own original thing rather than the reference

3455
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:59,500
and if you're talking about tales gets trolled it's a different sort of

3456
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:05,500
question maybe I'm being a little too hard on the scene because I think that

3457
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:09,980
maybe the point maybe there is a point like the point is to just the point is

3458
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:15,820
to compare Pearl to Utina which is like fair because I guess I've never seen

3459
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:20,580
Utina but she's like a knight or something and she's like I don't know

3460
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:27,060
she's heroic she's a pretty one of them has women or something okay just like

3461
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:32,900
Pearl yeah that's that's what I'm like they so I guess spiky nose I guess maybe

3462
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:37,740
I guess maybe it kind of does do that damn it only took a hundred episodes to

3463
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:42,460
I don't think that they expect I guess I guess it's like an Easter egg it's like

3464
02:45:42,460 --> 02:45:46,380
an Easter egg and if you've seen Utina you might be like oh I recognize the

3465
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:52,500
scene and it fits because Pearl is kind of like that most references like Easter

3466
02:45:52,500 --> 02:46:00,780
eggs yeah they are I am I reference the movie I reference the movie cannibal

3467
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:06,340
holocaust in villainers classes you can ever guarantee that your audience is

3468
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:10,540
gonna get a reference there's always gonna be some people don't get it yeah

3469
02:46:10,540 --> 02:46:15,300
I think you can expect you can expect that everyone will that basically everyone

3470
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:19,180
well it's like okay this this kind of brings me back to when I said I watched

3471
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:23,020
the show legends of tomorrow I literally watched that show for the references

3472
02:46:23,020 --> 02:46:27,740
because a legend of tomorrow references a lot of like DC comic characters like

3473
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:33,500
very obscure characters and every time they do I do the soyboy face the you

3474
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:38,460
know the face yeah with the Nintendo like I'm like I'm like watching legends

3475
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:43,940
of tomorrow and I'm like oh Bawana Beast oh I know that guy they do the fucking

3476
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:52,860
face that's my enjoyment of the show that's that's fine I guess I was I guess

3477
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:59,580
I was a little wrong I guess you know I can I appreciate the reference a

3478
02:46:59,580 --> 02:47:02,940
little more now that I think about it but I still think that originality is a

3479
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:07,940
virtue I mean I I mean I agree like yeah I mean luckily like the majority of

3480
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:14,060
Steven Universe is original true yeah as long as they're not constantly doing

3481
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:20,020
references and it's fine to have one every once in a while yeah I I know I

3482
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:27,180
never said it wasn't fine I didn't it didn't add anything to it for me I've

3483
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:34,940
always held the opinion that a reference should be like able to be enjoyed

3484
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:41,620
without getting it and if understanding utena is important to getting that that

3485
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:46,540
is a cool action shot then it's a bad reference but you could easily enjoy it

3486
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:53,820
without knowing that yeah it just had to like yeah like how I use this this famous

3487
02:47:54,780 --> 02:47:59,820
wave and in the Lord of Ghosts it's like it illustrates that there's a storm but

3488
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:10,060
it's also like hi I know that picture the use of the wave here is meant as

3489
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:17,740
shorthand to evoke all the feelings of the original bigness and wetness yeah

3490
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:23,420
I do the same thing with actually with my last panel for this page right here if

3491
02:48:23,420 --> 02:48:27,100
you look in the background like the silhouettes of those like characters

3492
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:32,460
that are impaled that's a reference to the movie cannibal holocausts where people

3493
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:38,460
get like impaled through their asshole out of their mouths that's pretty cool yes and it's

3494
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:41,740
oh that happens that happens in reverse in infinite jest

3495
02:48:50,300 --> 02:48:57,180
yeah all right next voicemail is called uh next voicemail is called um are you ready

3496
02:48:57,180 --> 02:49:04,300
it's called I am gay three two one go this is absolutely the one with the girl from

3497
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:10,940
new guy war infuriating to me because of the self-importance they imply self-importance

3498
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:18,300
that the guest you spoke with that went unchecked despite it being uninteresting and

3499
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:27,020
unintelligent because of the agreeable nature of you guys oh my god shut the fuck up I hate this

3500
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:32,220
I see this argument all the time like you know the comic quite okay I'm not quite sure what he's

3501
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:38,140
saying okay so he's saying basically that so Mallory's comic with with the dog like people's

3502
02:49:38,140 --> 02:49:44,380
problem is like oh no she's just so self-important about stealing it's like no she wasn't the

3503
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:48,780
character just does it in a panel it literally like there's no like kind of like oh yeah there's

3504
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:54,300
wait is that I thought this guy was saying something about murro logic no he said Mallory

3505
02:49:56,220 --> 02:50:01,580
and self-importance I he he was very hard to deter like I couldn't really well Mallory

3506
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:08,300
totally am I took something completely I thought he was saying that like we let murlogic talk for

3507
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:13,100
too long because we were too nice and we didn't why did I get a completely different message

3508
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:16,060
hang on I'm really listening to it yeah me too yeah me too

3509
02:50:18,700 --> 02:50:25,980
yeah girl from new guy okay yeah that's Mallory um yeah yeah he's talking about Mallory

3510
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:30,620
because he says the guy because Mallory also did the new guy Jesus Christ I fucking hate

3511
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:39,660
it's so like oh my god it's so I'm gonna say it everyone who's mad at that comic

3512
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:44,940
is fucking cucked I'll say that I I told yeah I agree I don't I don't get it at all because

3513
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:52,140
it's bizarre because it's kind of like so do you think that a retail worker should be fired if

3514
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:57,020
like someone steals like if just someone steals the retail workers should be fired

3515
02:50:57,020 --> 02:51:00,380
because like it seems like people say like because a lot of people said that

3516
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:05,980
oh like the retail worker could potentially be fired if you if you rob the store and it's like

3517
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:09,900
so you're kind of missing the point that that's like worse than like robbing a store right you

3518
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:15,420
shouldn't point yeah the problem there is that they can be fired for that right exactly which

3519
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:20,140
mostly they can't be like like in America that's not legal I mean it might happen but it's like

3520
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:27,740
it's not normal I oh my god I a lot of what Mallory said like I did see to that um she was talking

3521
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:32,460
about how like there was also like several lefties who also like weren't on her side about it which is

3522
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:36,700
so crazy because like you should like a lefty should realize like um actually like a boss

3523
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:41,980
shouldn't be allowed to fire at any retail worker that because as a real estate worker you're I

3524
02:51:41,980 --> 02:51:47,340
question what you're fucking what what what what theory what theory have you been reading if you

3525
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:52,940
are not on board with this I really I literally have not read any fucking theory but like not

3526
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:58,300
use this this hypothetical question yeah I go to me but I'm saying you don't even have to read

3527
02:51:58,300 --> 02:52:03,820
theories and be aware that like that's kind of a fuck worse fuck situation than like someone just

3528
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:08,780
like stealing right like there's so many people I saw I saw this one long ass post where someone was

3529
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:12,860
talking about that was their old job like oh someone stole who would get like potentially

3530
02:52:12,860 --> 02:52:16,780
fired or ridden up and then I and then I asked him like so do you think that you and your

3531
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:22,140
fellow employees should have like unionized or commenced a strike or something or would have been

3532
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:25,740
down for a co-op or whatever and they never like never fucking replied like it's so

3533
02:52:26,460 --> 02:52:34,700
Jesus Christ it's literally like the logic of like oh stealing is bad because the boss might

3534
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:41,740
get mad and fire the employee it's literally like oh you can't you know uh yeah don't disturb the

3535
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:47,100
we must pay homage to the beast it's literally like oh no no no you shouldn't you shouldn't

3536
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:50,860
fuck with that guy you shouldn't fuck with that guy because he'll get mad and beat up his girlfriend

3537
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:55,740
later it's like and she'll deserve it because you made him mad it's so it's like that logic where

3538
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:59,500
it's all like ha ha have you not heard of death by cops or you're saying that like cops are just

3539
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:04,300
like killers like we shouldn't fuck with them like they're by the fault like these bears that like

3540
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:08,220
oh if you don't listen to what they say they could fucking murder you so you think cops are monsters

3541
02:53:08,300 --> 02:53:12,140
that technically like you're like missing the fucking point and that's what and that's why

3542
02:53:12,140 --> 02:53:16,060
they're good and that's why we should obey them they're because they're because they're so powerful

3543
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:21,020
and they'll fucking murder you yeah it is which is good and i like that right exactly and i love

3544
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:29,260
that kind of like a like a pessimistic like doomer mentality almost exactly like that we can't do

3545
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:34,860
anything about it so we just have to like bend the knee to whatever is in charge yes it's capitalist

3546
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:39,820
it's capitalist realism it's like there's there's no changing this this is an immutable law of nature

3547
02:53:39,820 --> 02:53:44,620
the immutable law of nature is that stealing is wrong because bosses will fire their employees

3548
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:48,780
for things that are out of their control and we just we just have to accept that unironically

3549
02:53:48,780 --> 02:53:54,380
i think the only like i think the only lefty that i saw like um who who was like wasn't

3550
02:53:54,380 --> 02:54:00,540
defending mallory but he wasn't like saying like oh that ill stealing is bad i think is vosh

3551
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:05,740
because i think um i saw him talking about i saw mentioned in one tweet saying like um seeing this

3552
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:09,420
whole thing about like whether or not she's to steal from a retail store and he's like literally

3553
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:14,940
who fucking cares because it's a fucking like stealing is a symptom of a bigger fucking problem

3554
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:20,700
yeah it's not like stopping like you don't really fucking stop the problem if you just stop fucking

3555
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:25,260
stealing it's these motherfuckers who think that that real life works like fucking batman like

3556
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:29,660
batman isn't fucking making a difference at all that's why he lives in a fucking cartoon world

3557
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:35,020
where that's where it only fucking works there i'm so fuck oh i'm mad i'm heated i'm heated no

3558
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:41,180
yeah i get yep yep yep it sucks this is a fucking trigger for me stealing is okay so long as the

3559
02:54:41,180 --> 02:54:48,620
cops aren't around mad fuck the cops yeah fuck the cops yeah they shouldn't hey you know it would

3560
02:54:48,620 --> 02:54:53,580
be really cool is if there were never any cops around anywhere true that if we didn't pay if we

3561
02:54:53,580 --> 02:54:57,660
didn't pay for them we could have a word and another fucking thing that people ignored with the whole

3562
02:54:57,660 --> 02:55:03,020
like with that whole comic is that retail workers steal more than like customers like retail workers

3563
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:09,020
like 80 80 percent of retail workers steal just from their job way more than any customer probably

3564
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:13,980
true but also bosses steal more from their workers oh that's true then fucking even then they're

3565
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:20,060
stealing you're like yeah like stealing your overtime motherfuckers be talking about i hate stealing

is like he's he's replying to every single comment reply to me oh i'm gonna i'm gonna check let's see

3672
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:28,700
what he said pretty weird okay i did i did call him a nazi too um i don't know guys can we can we

3673
03:06:28,700 --> 03:06:38,860
just enjoy an asshole no i i love assholes but like i'm just i i understand i understand

3674
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:45,900
people not liking the guest i i was a little surprised by how people were like mad about

3675
03:06:45,900 --> 03:06:50,940
the fact that the guest was unlikable to me that does not seem like an inherent problem

3676
03:06:50,940 --> 03:06:55,420
yeah like i mean yeah you know you're it's an investment yeah you know people are getting

3677
03:06:55,420 --> 03:06:59,980
engaged like oh we i don't fuck with this guy i'm gonna reply to him it's like like let's

3678
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:05,980
like the disney come the disney world policy is like a bad experience that's been made up for

3679
03:07:05,980 --> 03:07:11,260
is better than a good experience so i it's like i give you stock home syndrome like i make you

3680
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:16,700
listen to a bad guest and then and then i apologize on the next episode and then you love me more

3681
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:20,300
than you did in the first place sometimes i convinced you that it was all part of a bad

3682
03:07:20,300 --> 03:07:26,860
guest can provide you with more entertainment trust the point i think actually i that's why i

3683
03:07:26,860 --> 03:07:32,780
think uh dick masterson sometimes gets really terrible guests just to basically uh make fun of

3684
03:07:32,780 --> 03:07:40,380
them or allow them to make fun of themselves by just saying the weird stuff they say i i think he

3685
03:07:40,380 --> 03:07:44,860
i think he definitely likes all the bad ones because he seems to be in pretty friendly

3686
03:07:44,860 --> 03:07:51,420
relationship with anybody on the yeah i mean dick dick just is i don't know he likes to

3687
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:59,420
extend all of brunch's just for politeness sake he so that he loves not why he loves not wisely but

3688
03:07:59,420 --> 03:08:04,380
too well i think he just loves not wisely but too well i mean sure like he's a classic

3689
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:11,100
bibronic hero i think he just a nice guy um nice guy sucks that 50 percent of the guests are

3690
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:16,380
nazis but nice guy i guess i think he just uh bs is a lot of them to trick them to come on to his

3691
03:08:16,380 --> 03:08:23,820
show more was that i don't watch that fucking show i think he just uh is pretends to be nice to a lot

3692
03:08:23,820 --> 03:08:28,460
of them just to trick them to continue to coming on to his show and provide more entertainment

3693
03:08:29,900 --> 03:08:38,460
my impression has been i feel like he's choking back he's pretending he's sort of holding back

3694
03:08:38,460 --> 03:08:43,100
his laughter yeah at least i don't i don't know how often at least sometimes i haven't listened to

3695
03:08:43,100 --> 03:08:50,460
one of his shows in in a while but yeah it does a lot of them when they're very strange i remember a

3696
03:08:50,460 --> 03:08:58,220
guy who's like like all talking about black pills and stuff extremely seriously oh was it sernovich

3697
03:08:58,220 --> 03:09:04,300
yeah like yeah that guy's a fucking monster oh yeah he's a real piece of shit real garbage

3698
03:09:05,100 --> 03:09:12,860
experience i i think i think the stereo's coconut figure that out and that's why he's like

3699
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:19,180
not even on the show anymore um you know that's what i thought i mean but i can't find any record

3700
03:09:19,180 --> 03:09:24,060
that like i mean but the stereo is left for that it doesn't seem like there's any like public

3701
03:09:24,060 --> 03:09:28,780
falling out between them at all no they didn't have a they like i think a stereo knows that if he

3702
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:34,860
does have a falling out with dick it's basically over for him because his community is just too

3703
03:09:34,860 --> 03:09:40,060
tight with the dick show so it's kind of like i i'd be too fucking risky of a move i already

3704
03:09:40,060 --> 03:09:45,260
built like an internet presence and dick is sad not i mean not sadly but like he's attached to that

3705
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:51,020
and now like if i like if i shit on it or like you know because he is much more like liberal i think

3706
03:09:51,020 --> 03:09:56,220
he got more liberal the more i don't want to i don't want to i don't want to speculate i don't

3707
03:09:56,220 --> 03:10:03,500
want to speculate on is stereo's interiority i mean yeah but i will say that for my part yeah if i

3708
03:10:04,300 --> 03:10:09,340
were close with the dick show and i decided i didn't like it anymore and i didn't want to be a part

3709
03:10:09,340 --> 03:10:15,980
of it anymore i would be very afraid to like alienate that whole group oh yeah uh because

3710
03:10:15,980 --> 03:10:22,380
there's a lot of them and i feel like a lot of them are highly amoral and who knows what the

3711
03:10:22,380 --> 03:10:28,220
fuck they would do unironically it's uh yeah i think the ship has already sailed on that one

3712
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:38,140
um no nobody no literally nobody who listens to the dick show listens to the pcb not a single

3713
03:10:38,140 --> 03:10:45,340
solitary soul i guarantee and i promise oh yeah that's i hundred percent confirmed

3714
03:10:46,300 --> 03:10:51,260
i know every fan of the pcb i know every single person that listens to the show because there's

3715
03:10:51,260 --> 03:10:55,500
like a hundred of them and they just listen like 20 times each and that's why we get a few thousand

3716
03:10:55,500 --> 03:11:02,300
views but i remember specifically uh one time dick had this weird creepy stalker guy on his uh

3717
03:11:02,300 --> 03:11:09,980
on his show and uh he was he was pretending to be nice to him just to have him say weird stuff

3718
03:11:10,700 --> 03:11:15,740
and uh the guy didn't figure it out i think his name is chris the kiwi or something like that

3719
03:11:16,060 --> 03:11:23,660
and uh that rings eventually he he figured out that dick was just bs-ing him and now he

3720
03:11:23,660 --> 03:11:31,420
hates dick and is trying to dox him and stuff uh yeah i mean i would hate i would hate someone

3721
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:36,220
that did that to me i think there's only a handful of people who could potentially dox dick because

3722
03:11:36,220 --> 03:11:40,300
i think he lives he unironically does like live in like some secret hideout kind of those

3723
03:11:41,260 --> 03:11:49,820
i remember in in in a in a side of a mountain in in los angeles yeah like that's how his show

3724
03:11:49,820 --> 03:11:54,540
starts it says like from a hidden base in the mountains hidden by from the side of the mountain

3725
03:11:54,540 --> 03:12:01,580
in the city of failure yeah i think yeah and i think did you did confirm that that is accurate

3726
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:08,300
but did you did not disclose the location and he's got like i didn't he's got mines and and bazookas

3727
03:12:08,300 --> 03:12:14,380
and sniper rifles no i mean true no it could take out a dick and i mean i don't want dick to get

3728
03:12:14,380 --> 03:12:21,020
dox i don't think he deserves to get dox i just think i just i assume he just lived in the fucking

3729
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:24,940
city i didn't know any of this there's a hand there's a handful of people i think could deserve to

3730
03:12:24,940 --> 03:12:31,820
get dox but i won't say i mean some people deserve i don't want to literally anything that might

3731
03:12:31,820 --> 03:12:41,100
happen to them but some people just want to watch the world burn exactly how many more voicemails

3732
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:49,500
we got there are exactly two more voicemails hell yeah and uh this next one is called mad

3733
03:12:50,380 --> 03:12:57,420
three two one go you stupid motherfuckers kept sucking you on the bread guys dick because the

3734
03:12:57,420 --> 03:13:04,140
boss is worth a money on stupid fucking commissions and because he kept repeating this catchphrase

3735
03:13:04,140 --> 03:13:10,380
like what was it because i'm sorry he's a he's a funny he's a funny he's not he didn't make that up

3736
03:13:10,380 --> 03:13:17,500
he got it from fortune yeah or whatever website he goes through um because he didn't repeat it

3737
03:13:17,500 --> 03:13:22,860
because he's a genius he repeated because he's an artist he doesn't know how else you to speak

3738
03:13:22,940 --> 03:13:33,740
is an obsessive fucking stupid motherfucker and and and that how you guys came off on on this

3739
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:40,140
this episode really dumb agreeable pieces of shit i think god this guy hates it when we're

3740
03:13:40,140 --> 03:13:45,500
agreeable i think i mean it was digi who called him a genius marketer i didn't know it was from

3741
03:13:45,740 --> 03:13:51,740
yeah that that was very kind of like it was just i don't know digi thinks that guy's a genius

3742
03:13:51,740 --> 03:13:57,340
wow wow digi's digi's easily impressed by something stupid amazing it's that

3743
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:06,460
i don't know i i i did feel a bit bad like afterwards because i was like i wasn't prepared

3744
03:14:06,460 --> 03:14:12,540
for all of their stupid political stuff that they had in their head i i thought it was just

3745
03:14:12,540 --> 03:14:17,500
the wonderbread guy i didn't know anything else about them and so listening to that i was sitting

3746
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:23,740
there listening to them prattle on about like conspiracies and i'm like i need to tell this

3747
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:28,700
guy to stop because it's stupid but i i don't want to come across like i don't know what i'm talking

3748
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:33,580
about and i couldn't formulate like an argument i wasn't really in the like the right mindset to

3749
03:14:33,580 --> 03:14:39,500
like argue with someone about that loudly i had i had the sense that he was that kind of guy but

3750
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:43,820
i also kind of just didn't want to talk to about him about that with him because like who cares

3751
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:48,700
what he thinks about any of that stuff i mean that's i mean that's the that's the thing like

3752
03:14:49,820 --> 03:14:55,100
it's kind of like i i think about this too because sometimes i want to have potential guests

3753
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:59,660
that i disagree with on my podcast and cheesy cast cheesy cast youtube channel by the way

3754
03:14:59,660 --> 03:15:03,900
link in the description link in the description but um but i'm thinking like the thing is like

3755
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:08,140
if you ask them to get on and it's like like you're not you're not paying them to get on it's

3756
03:15:08,140 --> 03:15:13,020
kind of like oh you kind of got to be nice to them unless you're like i'm not gonna like i'm not

3757
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:16,380
gonna be rude to the guests like right to their face i'm gonna wait until they leave and then

3758
03:15:16,380 --> 03:15:20,940
do it behind their back unless you're like debating them or something unless it's like a blood sport

3759
03:15:20,940 --> 03:15:25,100
thing or if you're paying them i feel like if you pay a guest you you're probably allowed to be a

3760
03:15:25,100 --> 03:15:30,220
piece of shit to them like i'm gonna like i'm gonna at least wait until the episode is all recorded

3761
03:15:30,940 --> 03:15:36,140
look and then before i start an argument look if it makes it feel like yeah what's great about

3762
03:15:36,140 --> 03:15:45,260
that time that uh what was his name bill bill um mary um a talk show host guy he had uh he was

3763
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:50,700
liberal mar bill yeah he had uh milo on his show and everybody really didn't like that

3764
03:15:51,580 --> 03:15:56,300
yeah i mean bill well milo is a fucking piece of shit i i built you can have people want to show

3765
03:15:56,300 --> 03:16:02,780
you disagree with it doesn't mean that you agree with him isn't it bill mayor is that is it mayor

3766
03:16:02,860 --> 03:16:08,300
i thought it was mar uh well her i mean it was kind of fucked up about that is oh yeah bill mayor

3767
03:16:09,260 --> 03:16:13,740
or bill mar i fucking we kind of fucked up about the bill mars shit is that um they were he was

3768
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:20,380
very friendly to milo like very fucking friendly and then when milo got exposed as a pedo apologist

3769
03:16:20,380 --> 03:16:25,420
he was acting like oh well you see he bill was trying to claim that he was the one behind it even

3770
03:16:25,420 --> 03:16:29,900
though it was like the drunken peasants who exposed them as like a pedo apologist

3771
03:16:30,620 --> 03:16:39,180
right yeah i heard something about that yeah yeah um either way it's pretty obvious that uh bill mar

3772
03:16:39,180 --> 03:16:45,180
didn't agree with milo at all about most of the things he said that was made obvious on the show as

3773
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:52,620
well i haven't i haven't seen it so i haven't watched it in a long time maybe maybe i remember bill mar

3774
03:16:52,620 --> 03:16:56,380
being very friendly but i guess he was just friendly maybe he did disagree with a lot of things

3775
03:16:56,380 --> 03:17:03,020
but being friendly doesn't mean you agree with the other person true true i mean you're not wrong

3776
03:17:04,300 --> 03:17:07,740
i don't know i personally have no idea i have absolutely no idea i haven't seen the thing i

3777
03:17:07,740 --> 03:17:13,260
never saw the thing what's great about this episode is that like which instead of like you

3778
03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:17,740
shitting on the guests you get the guests of the next episode is shit on the previous one like i

3779
03:17:18,620 --> 03:17:22,540
i mean i did it for you basically i i hopped in and one of the first things i said was like i

3780
03:17:22,540 --> 03:17:27,900
think mere logic is a nazi he clearly has nazi vibes i think he's just a shitty libertarian

3781
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:33,580
which like i mean sort of tomato tomato i mean uh when push when push comes to show the push comes

3782
03:17:33,580 --> 03:17:39,500
to shove like i know who's side they're on yeah for sure i did i did not see that coming

3783
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:47,660
i should i should have because um or i did because like before like i talked to him very

3784
03:17:47,660 --> 03:17:53,260
briefly like before the the the pod the episode like just to tell him like you know get him in

3785
03:17:53,260 --> 03:17:58,460
the server tell him like how we record and stuff with the time you know unlike some people i told

3786
03:17:58,460 --> 03:18:04,540
the guests when we record the podcast uh and then and he and he was and even then he started talking

3787
03:18:04,540 --> 03:18:09,260
about jannies and how the jannies do it for free like in text and i had to tell him like listen

3788
03:18:09,340 --> 03:18:15,820
i have to go make curry now i can't just talk about i knew there was going to be a problem

3789
03:18:15,820 --> 03:18:21,820
when he mentioned that he was like a fan of of of legendary ben saint enemy of mr meddaker

3790
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:29,100
uh he yeah yeah he did uh man i fucking hate that guy yeah because he said he was

3791
03:18:29,100 --> 03:18:33,100
spouting this conspiracy theory that meddaker invented i'm like hold up hold up hold up

3792
03:18:33,420 --> 03:18:39,340
listening to it which one was that uh when he said that like oh the media companies

3793
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:42,860
oh they're gonna they're gonna wipe us they're gonna wipe us they're gonna censor us all out

3794
03:18:42,860 --> 03:18:48,060
there they don't like the narrative that uh that trump is president so it's against their

3795
03:18:48,060 --> 03:18:53,260
narrative they wanted hillary so they're gonna soon like wipe us out uh in the biden administration

3796
03:18:53,260 --> 03:18:57,580
and it's like it's like all it's like this conspiracy it's this whole conspiracy theory

3797
03:18:57,580 --> 03:19:01,580
that like oh yeah big tech companies they're a hundred percent progressive you know they're

3798
03:19:01,580 --> 03:19:06,700
totally left-winged you know nothing is more socialist than like powerful i mean meddaker

3799
03:19:06,700 --> 03:19:13,020
didn't invent that point of view no but i'm but i'm saying i think he's he mentioned how that's

3800
03:19:13,020 --> 03:19:18,140
like one of the final things meddaker's went before he became kind of silent recently was this

3801
03:19:18,140 --> 03:19:22,220
conspiracy theory that he dropped i mean it's not an original conspiracy theory no conspiracy

3802
03:19:22,220 --> 03:19:27,500
theory is like two original nowadays but i'm just saying the fact that he like a hundred percent

3803
03:19:27,500 --> 03:19:33,980
believes this conspiracy theory invented by a known reactionary um it says a lot about for sure

3804
03:19:33,980 --> 03:19:40,860
it says a lot about the guy yeah i mean it all it all fits it all fits with uh with uh the the

3805
03:19:40,860 --> 03:19:48,620
portrait the portrait that i have built in my in my uh interior mind space hey we got one more

3806
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:58,940
voicemail we got one more and it's called orwell was based three two one go animal farm is more

3807
03:19:58,940 --> 03:20:05,580
about how totalitarianism is bad rather than communism after the animals overthrew the humans

3808
03:20:05,580 --> 03:20:11,100
which are of course an allegory for the bourgeois capitalists they collectivize and have a pretty

3809
03:20:11,100 --> 03:20:17,260
bombast time it's only after one of the pigs goes full dictators at things turn for the worse

3810
03:20:17,260 --> 03:20:22,220
i see how people can interpret the story as anti-communist but i perceive it as being

3811
03:20:22,220 --> 03:20:29,180
about how totalitarianism can sneak into any ideology george orwell was a democratic socialist

3812
03:20:29,180 --> 03:20:34,860
in his memoir an homage to katalonia he talks about how cool anarchism and collectivization are

3813
03:20:34,860 --> 03:20:40,220
i highly recommend you read it i've heard that orwell i don't know that much about orwell but

3814
03:20:40,220 --> 03:20:46,540
i've heard that he went to spain to kill fascists but i also heard that he like snitched on communists

3815
03:20:47,260 --> 03:20:54,300
hmm that's interesting i am i i do i i agree i agree with his voicemail um it's it's something i

3816
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:59,500
kind of like figure it out um where i was talking i was arguing with one of my friends and they were

3817
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:05,100
trying to convince me that stalin was a fascist and i'm like uh no he was like a bunch of other

3818
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:11,660
things that you can associate a fascist with but like his ideology wasn't like fascism fascism like

3819
03:21:11,660 --> 03:21:16,540
at all right yeah and i i think to be honest i don't really know that much about stalinism

3820
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:21,340
in specific yeah me me neither i know a couple things around it but i but the thing is like what

3821
03:21:21,340 --> 03:21:27,900
the thing is like all fascism is like authoritarian but not all authoritarians are like fascists

3822
03:21:27,900 --> 03:21:32,380
right i think with fascists you need kind of like there's a couple of like key factors like

3823
03:21:32,940 --> 03:21:39,820
oh like a return to glory and you need like a scapegoat uh to blame everything on it's like

3824
03:21:39,820 --> 03:21:45,180
i mean it's like um there are a bunch of things that fascism tends to be like but it doesn't have

3825
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:50,620
to be any of them because you know i think that also due to the fact that fascism wasn't like

3826
03:21:50,620 --> 03:21:55,180
invented in the university it was like invented in the streets it's like almost pure emotional so

3827
03:21:55,180 --> 03:22:05,340
it's like isn't isn't fascism like yeah supposed to be the the return to um like a a state of things

3828
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:10,140
where people are on top and people are underneath and that's just the way it is and there's no

3829
03:22:10,780 --> 03:22:18,300
there's no like reason that gets to that like it's just um i think i watched a video by vorsch

3830
03:22:18,940 --> 03:22:25,740
yeah who who talked about like politics 101 or something and he explained like back in feudalism

3831
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:32,700
times or some some you know peasantry medieval people was dumb they couldn't read them right

3832
03:22:33,660 --> 03:22:39,340
um people generally just believe that the kings were ordained by god and that's just how it is

3833
03:22:39,340 --> 03:22:44,780
and there's no there's no reason and then there was the age of enlightenment or whatever and

3834
03:22:44,780 --> 03:22:53,900
people were like wait we can think oh my god and so like like fascism tends to go back to an age

3835
03:22:53,900 --> 03:23:00,460
where people didn't think about anything and they just said these specific people are on top just

3836
03:23:00,540 --> 03:23:06,460
because and these these other people are subservient and that's just how it should be

3837
03:23:06,460 --> 03:23:11,900
there's no logic there's no reason there's no like ideology that you could really point to

3838
03:23:11,900 --> 03:23:17,740
that explains it because they don't think in that way i i think that yeah i think that does go hand

3839
03:23:17,740 --> 03:23:24,220
in hand with what i mentioned about a return to former glory like uh musulini like oh return to

3840
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:30,940
we're returning back to roam i mean higher hierarchical hierarchical thinking is just kind of

3841
03:23:30,940 --> 03:23:37,900
this the the thing is just kind of the defining feature of like the right generally like like

3842
03:23:37,900 --> 03:23:44,700
that's that's what makes you like further right to a certain extent is like how hierarch and fascism

3843
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:50,060
is a far right ideology so it is it is also an extremely like you know those at the top and

3844
03:23:50,060 --> 03:23:53,900
those at the bottom and those at the top are just there because they're the right just because

3845
03:23:53,900 --> 03:23:59,180
they're there and it's you know it's always seems to be that the people who would benefit most from

3846
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:07,580
fascism are the ones who want it back at the top weird capitalism is very hierarchical too well

3847
03:24:07,580 --> 03:24:15,260
what i want to know is is dr eggman fascist uh he's like a tech i tell like a joke was coming

3848
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:21,980
he's like a techno fascist dr eggman in prisons animals in robots for some reason

3849
03:24:22,940 --> 03:24:27,340
because the robots are powered by the small animals i feel like this was the only human

3850
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:32,060
being in the world i don't think there is politics well i think he maybe his i mean i don't know

3851
03:24:32,060 --> 03:24:38,700
maybe his plan is like to return to the former glory or an imagined time i mean he's authoritarian

3852
03:24:38,700 --> 03:24:46,140
that's for sure like like eggman like with with maria right bowser steels princess maria has motivation

3853
03:24:46,700 --> 03:24:52,940
sonic rescues animals but does eggman just want to imprison animals is that the idea he wants he

3854
03:24:52,940 --> 03:24:58,780
wants he wants he wants a robot arm he wants the chaos emeralds to kill who there's no one else

3855
03:24:58,780 --> 03:25:05,420
i think does it the chaos emeralds like he just wants power the chaos emeralds like can work

3856
03:25:05,420 --> 03:25:10,700
reality right maybe he's trying to bring back all humans he he and there are humans in sonic

3857
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:16,060
he imprisons he imprisons the you're right you're right he imprisons the animals to make the robots

3858
03:25:16,060 --> 03:25:22,140
to gain power and he uses that the the robots to seek the master emeralds to gain even more power

3859
03:25:22,140 --> 03:25:27,180
he just wants to take over more he just wants to be the most powerful boy he's just pure he just

3860
03:25:27,180 --> 03:25:31,420
he's like a dr doom type that just wants as much power as possible because he just thinks

3861
03:25:31,420 --> 03:25:38,060
everything will be better under his rule now i want to watch a a cyber shell video about

3862
03:25:38,060 --> 03:25:45,020
what is eggman's ultimate plan what if eggman did it all what what would happen

3863
03:25:45,740 --> 03:25:50,140
well what what what what if eggman won there's probably there's probably an archie all the

3864
03:25:50,140 --> 03:25:55,740
chaos emeralds and he turns supersonic at his mustache went gold there's actually there's got

3865
03:25:55,740 --> 03:26:01,820
to be there's got to be a run of sonic the hedgehog comic books that is like what if eggman won like

3866
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:05,900
it's impossible that there isn't probably but yeah this question actually was already answered in

3867
03:26:05,980 --> 03:26:12,620
sonic cd is in sonic cd there is a bad and good futures so the bad future is basically when eggman

3868
03:26:12,620 --> 03:26:17,900
won isn't it isn't that it's just like a single it's just like a single frame of like the city on

3869
03:26:17,900 --> 03:26:23,980
fire isn't wait isn't the first sonic the bad future because sonic is only one is it sonic is

3870
03:26:23,980 --> 03:26:33,180
like the last fucking timeline cyber show what's the sonic timeline please i need a video he's

3871
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:41,820
probably working on it right now hell yeah i i i think i think that uh did the timeline go is

3872
03:26:41,820 --> 03:26:50,780
sonic one and then sonic two and then sonic three and then knuckles and then that's the timeline and

3873
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:57,020
then knuckles two and then knuckles three knuckles three and tails is somewhere else we don't talk

3874
03:26:57,020 --> 03:27:09,660
about him he's having this sky adventure spin-off game uh um um um or well or well uh i think he was

3875
03:27:09,660 --> 03:27:17,340
okay or well that ends well or well that ends well baby we did it no we finished the voicemails

3876
03:27:17,340 --> 03:27:22,220
wait let me let me refresh what if we've gotten a new one oh my god we got one all right i'm gonna

3877
03:27:22,220 --> 03:27:27,900

3878
03:27:27,900 --> 03:27:36,860
second you cheeky little bitch uh you fucker all right here we go uh three two one go so i have a

3879
03:27:36,860 --> 03:27:44,140
very specific issue and that's with tv remotes why are they not rechargeable it makes no sense

3880
03:27:44,140 --> 03:27:50,220
that they're not rechargeable tv remotes i'm ironically true though they're not what do you

3881
03:27:50,220 --> 03:27:55,340
you know what a tv remote is no i mean like the the idea of it not being rechargeable like

3882
03:27:55,340 --> 03:28:01,100
why don't you switch batteries out from them where would you plug it in batteries what well you

3883
03:28:01,100 --> 03:28:07,580
just have a dock like on your on your like you know i don't know i literally cannot even recall a

3884
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:14,460
single time i've needed to change the batteries on a tv remote really last for 20 years i i remember

3885
03:28:14,460 --> 03:28:18,460
like so many times i had to change the batteries well i guess we also we also did the thing where

3886
03:28:18,460 --> 03:28:23,100
like if one thing needed batteries we'd switch it out of another product and put it in it we

3887
03:28:23,100 --> 03:28:29,740
we had like my dad had like all this like sound equipment he had like a dvd player and a stereo

3888
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:34,300
and all these like other stereos and all these like and like the tv was hooked up to like a

3889
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:39,580
surround sound system and that had it so we had like six different remotes and like i only knew

3890
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:45,020
what like one and a half of them did um so we had all these fucking remotes floating around and then

3891
03:28:45,100 --> 03:28:51,740
they were all needed occasionally so yeah i was batteries needed changing uh uh on the fairly

3892
03:28:51,740 --> 03:29:01,020
regularly they're all needed occasionally just like dough i i think i i agree yeah like uh uh

3893
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:07,580
just yeah make them make them rechargeable fuck batteries i i guess i i yeah i agree with it

3894
03:29:07,580 --> 03:29:14,220
it's every never something i've never thought would see the only the only time i fuck with batteries

3895
03:29:14,940 --> 03:29:22,780
is my my wireless mouse when i when my wireless mouse drains its single double a battery and

3896
03:29:22,780 --> 03:29:29,900
i have to change it and every time i do i'm like god i can't fucking believe that a device that i use

3897
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:36,380
uses double a batteries why why are we still doing this yeah everything should just be

3898
03:29:36,380 --> 03:29:42,860
rechargeable nowadays yeah what the fuck nintendo yeah what the fuck um uh she'll get around me

3899
03:29:43,740 --> 03:29:52,620
logitech what the fuck company makes this this mouse i don't batteries in 2020 uh cringe they are

3900
