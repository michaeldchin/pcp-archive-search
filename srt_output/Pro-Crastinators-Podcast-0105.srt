00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're on the PCP. It's an internet show. It's a podcast. You know it is. It's me, Munchy.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have Digi here. We have Danger Boy. It's the best guy's ever new character. It's Danger Boy.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello, everyone. I'm currently falling at light speed from the top of a skyscraper headed towards the ground.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's where I'll be reporting in for this entire podcast, so I'll send you updates periodically.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's going so fast that rubber bands, the point where he can do an entire podcast, will take something to himself.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, that's right. Time has slowed down because I'm approaching the speed of light or something.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's so dangerous. I love the editing.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hippo, it's you.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My drug of choice is tea.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Rayman. When's Rayman 2? Come on, let's be serious.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's my drug.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's get serious. We were all choking around, but come on.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I need to get pretty high for that.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We have been.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Fuck. I'm not dangerous at all.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, my God. It's Danger Boy Sidekick Mild Lad.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, no. I don't want to see what you're going to do, Master.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't look.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's a slave.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm just a boy. I can't take the weapons.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Today, on the podcast, there was politically correct, morally aligned, conventionally socially acceptable podcasts on the internet.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We're talking about fucking weed.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Drugs, this is not just the weed podcast, except it literally is just going to be the weed podcast.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We all know it's coming. We all know that's just what is going to happen.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I decided that on the off chance that this was supposed to be an intervention,

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because I was had a sneaking suspicion you were just going to pull an intervention on me,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
so I thought the funniest way that could happen is if I was showed up as high as humanly possible.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And that bomb rip I took at the start of the show just now was so heavy that I thought I was hallucinating

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
what Nate was saying in his intro, because I thought it was too funny to be real.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What an endorsement.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The Urban Dictionary for drugs is so fucking long, and it's like a realized Wikipedia article.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't have time for this shit.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The beginning part is pretty good. Just that first little paragraph there.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Drugs are chemicals that alter, block, or mimic chemical reactions in the brain.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This causes an alteration of the body's normal processes,

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
causing physical, faster heartbeat, deeper respiratory diseases,

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and so on, hedgehog bubbles, etc.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The fact that the fucking Urban Dictionary article is like this is funny.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like a parody of itself, because it's making fun of how, in a way,

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
how people who are into drugs get extremely serious when it comes to the topic of defending drugs.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's no means. It's just like, oh no, we need to give you all the science,

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
because like...

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's like enough joking around, enough joking around.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, put on the suits, and we like, you know, quaff our hair back.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We have a lot of fun here on Urban Dictionary, but this is important.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Far better of description is the definition for weed.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
God's gift to the world brings peace released wisely past the blunt dude,

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but they take sums up all of our opinions quite nicely.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just for the record, I think it's, we've done this before,

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but let's just read off, of course, our entire podcast is drug-themed to begin with,

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
so we are the PCP, and PCP, aka Angel Dust, is, again, we've read this before,

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
it is the scariest of all drugs, according to Urban Dictionary,

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
was used as a horse tranquilizer, makes the user hallucinate,

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
become extremely violent, and not feel anything.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
People have been known to do horrible things to themselves,

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
while under the influence of PCP, do not use the PCP, it will ruin your life.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, it definitely is, like, a drug that is highly destructive,

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and I am a huge fan of PCP as a joke because of the whitest kids-you-know skit,

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
a gallon of PCP, which is one of my favorite skits of all time,

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
so when we had the opportunity to be called the PCP, I jumped on it for those reasons.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When we're gonna get PCP brand soda, and exclusively sell them non-two liters,

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
or like bottles, but in gallons.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, that would be fucking awesome, that's genius!

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We gotta make a PCP drink!

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, shit! I feel like this is really doable!

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's just a gallon of munchies pee.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, again, doable.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That would make sense, yeah, it's still doable.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We just have munchies, buy gallon bottles of water,

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
build up with piss and mail to the people, that's totally normal.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Dude, you've seen how much piss I can piss,

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
like all the times I piss on the show, I do it in like two McDonald's large cups.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, I've seen the piss cups, they're fucking...

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Munchie, we could actually, like, I feel like there's some people who would buy this,

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you have to be 18 before we can sell your piss, probably,

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but I feel like...

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Probably.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I don't know what the tax is on me sending that much liquid, but, you know...

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Once I reach 18, there's gonna be so many content, like, opportunities,

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
there's gonna be so many new things, like once I'm 18...

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, no, dick is gonna be everywhere, like...

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know!

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know, you guys saw a lot of Eric Andre's dick,

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
wait till you see fucking Munchies, like, I'm 18 now.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's come up later this fucking year,

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
get fucking ready for that shit.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And with all these restrictions and limitations happening on YouTube in general,

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and it seems like the weight of the world is shifting towards Pornhub

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
as, like, the main uploading site for, like, most of the world,

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
so I just think that in the years to come,

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
we're gonna be seeing a lot of Munchie content on Pornhub,

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
just, you know, regardless of the context within.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's an exciting future.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I really hope that's the world we're heading for,

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is where, like, Pornh is just into...

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, I always thought it's a little weird,

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and when you think about it, that YouTube has banned Pornh,

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
because if Pornh and other videos were on the same website,

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
like, it would be more convenient for everybody,

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
the only problem is that people don't want to present themselves as having...

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, we wanna keep those identities separated for social reasons,

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but if we didn't have that social barrier,

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
if, like, sex and porn were, like, just acceptable things to talk about,

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
like, there would be no reason not to integrate those.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, what's that one...

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's, like, that video on YouTube that's, like,

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
see a penis inside of a vagina,

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the one where it's just, like, a straight-up, like,

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
documentary of what it looks like to come inside a vagina.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's pretty cool.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm gonna go watch that right now.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm pulling it off.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Show notes, everybody. Show notes.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The future of PCB is all of us in a sauna with no towels on.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We're just pure, fucking, unadulteratedly naked,

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and we're doing the podcast from within a sauna.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Our bodies are glistening. That's coming up in, like, two years.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
All right.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's fucking set to porn music, and it looks...

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I mean, this is great.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All right, all right, yeah, it's actually pretty good.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We already did that.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's start off with the podcast with a very important thing.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Who here is straight edge?

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm straight edge.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Define straight.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, please define.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I kind of wish I was.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, hang on. Let me pull up fucking straight edge on UrbanDictionary.com.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, let me do this. I know the history of it,

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because straight edge comes from the hardcore punk scene in music,

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
where certain punk bands, because the members of the band were so young,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they had the X's on their hand that meant they couldn't drink,

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and some of them took it as, like, an identity thing.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's like, well, we don't, like, we are an anti-drug band anyways,

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
so people started wearing those X's on their hands

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and calling themselves straight edge in, like, straight edge punk

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
was like a subcategory, basically.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Dude, that's like the punk version of those, like, purity rings

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that, like, Mormon kids wear and shit.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All right, cool, cool.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But that's what to be straight edge.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Traditionally, to say, like, oh, you are straight edge,

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
in, like, either, like, rap or punk is usually...

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So would you say it's like a mental thing

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
rather than a literal, like, I have not imbibed any of these things?

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, it's more like choosing, yeah, it's more of an identity thing.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because I have technically done one weed,

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and I have done a lot of drink of alcohols.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know whether that's covered in this book.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's very much not straight edge.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Catch me in the garden out back doing all the weed,

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
pulling them, planting them, just going nuts on those weeds.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I did so much fucking weed, my lawn was barren for two years afterwards.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All that grass was gone and inside of my stomach and lungs.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, yeah, all right, all right, but the good question.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So who is straight edge here?

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I would pretty much define myself as basically straight edge,

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
for the most part.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But you drink alcohol.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, but, like, so rarely.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Like, at Radcon 3, I don't think I drank a single drop of alcohol

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the entire time, and it's because I just don't care.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I mean, we didn't have that much to me.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's true.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
To me, getting drunk or whatever is just like a distraction.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All I am, what gets me high in this life, it's 100% true,

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
is achieving my goals and getting work done.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's all I care about or want to do.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You don't need to get high to have fun.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All you need to do is achieve your goals.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But I will tell you though, I will tell you though,

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I wouldn't say I'm 100% straight edge, you know, like clinically,

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
because I do two great drugs.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
One is caffeine.

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I've started drinking coffee, basically every day.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Not much.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, that's the thing.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm currently consuming the two drugs of choice in my life right now.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
One is caffeine, which isn't really that big a deal.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The other is probably the most insidious drug on the face of the earth.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It is a nightmare.

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It is ruining society.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Esther Jackson.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, it is sugar.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I am currently consuming a gigantic pudding cup I bought from Whole Foods,

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
specifically for this podcast.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Listen to me.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Alright, Nate, you get to be straight edge.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're allowed to be straight edge because of this faggot ass thing

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you're saying at the moment.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hippo, I know you drink and do it with me.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I do drink on occasion when it's like a party

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and it's like, well, I need something in my hand, so I may as well.

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I don't have a cock, so I'll take a beer.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That'll work instead.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mean, that would be kind of cumbersome

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
to hold some guy's dick in that way.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You'd have to coordinate your movements really well.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Would they be like...

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, you arrange a big circle where it rotates around

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and everyone gets visited like the part of the table

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
with the snacks that they want, but okay, go ahead.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you want me to do a Patreon if you're a gay male?

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Just do it.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Patreon Skyrockets.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
As literally everyone in the audience thinks, wow, that was just for me.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think what I would define as straight edge is like,

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
if there's no reason, but you still think,

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
yeah, I'll have a drink, then you're not straight edge.

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Or I'll have a smoke.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If there's no societal pressure on you,

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
if there's no advantage other than I'm bored

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and I just feel like it, then yeah.

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I guess I'm not straight edge,

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because I have drunk on streams and just generally.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So there's words of you drinking that I can give to the police.

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, I am under 12 years old.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There's degrees of straight edge and I guess being not straight edge.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, there's fucking not.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's the whole point.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Being straight edge is like an absolute identity commitment.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But I mean, but I do once in a while like you.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then you're not fucking straight edge.

232
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You fall short.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, for what it's worth.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, you're like that guy in Scott Pilgrim who ate the chicken parmesan

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and there's not vegan anymore.

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can we address the fact that Nate is staunchly anti-identitarian

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in the first place and therefore should not even begin to describe himself

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
as straight edge when it's like an exclusively,

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the term exists for identitarian purposes.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's like, I mean, yeah, I guess so.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For practical purposes.

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So we can identify how much people care about drugs in the course of this podcast.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean, I would describe the origin of it as very similar

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to the origin of the term social justice warrior

245
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
when like they actually called themselves that

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and then eventually like people started in the same way that people

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
not call people.

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, you're like straight edge because they're trying to say basically

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
we're not going to invite you to a party because you think you're boring.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I feel like there is a practical usage of the word here

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
that just means someone who doesn't consume like drugs or alcohol on a regular basis.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean, is there another word that I should use instead for that?

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Like clean?

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Just say I don't drink because I fucking care about my body.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's like at least two more words.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Here's how it is.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you don't do it, if you don't do it on the regular,

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if you just do it very, very occasionally, then you're straight edge.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I would say the health nut.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because that's the core reason he's not drinking.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you do it like mildly to all the time, you are bent.

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You know, it's funny that you say I'm a health nut.

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
In my mind, to all the actual health nuts out there,

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm an embarrassment and a disgrace that I'm even eating sugar right now.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You own cans of beans at all.

266
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That is to be a health nut.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Every time we go grocery shopping, we come home and immediately eat a Lunchables.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That is the first thing that happens.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay, so you see, men of your lifestyle live in the depths of depravity.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can't even fathom how high the ceiling is, how high the ceiling can go.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
My parents are vegans, so I absolutely know where the ceiling can go.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But you can still eat sugar though, and sugar is death.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to ask you though, Nate, if you had given up on your body,

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
if you decided you were like, oh, I can't be passionate about this anymore

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
for whatever reason, something else is more important,

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
do you think you would take up casual drinking?

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, no, because the reason I don't drink is specifically because

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
it just is like a night waster, in my opinion.

279
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What if you were in a situation where you had to waste the nights though?

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There was no choice.

281
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, if the night is just...

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm at a Christmas party, and I'm there just to hang out,

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and I can't even work if I want to.

284
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
At that point, there's no reason not to drink, so I would probably consider it.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What if things were different, and the reason why you don't like something

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
didn't exist, would you do it then?

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, I mean, that's the real...

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
When I go to visit my parents around Christmas time,

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can't even do work if I want to,

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
so there's no reason to not drink, so I'm much more likely to do so.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The reason I'm saying this, Munchie, is that I want to characterize him

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
as it's more about his health and his productivity,

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
whereas I feel like people who are sincerely straight-edge

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
would not have drank even if they had to waste the night

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
because they are against the existence of these drugs.

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That used to be me, I'm not like that anymore.

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When I was a kid, I was legitimately scared of alcohol,

298
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but we'll talk about that later.

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I thought of the thing, we've got straight-edge, which is that,

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
which is you would not take it even if...

301
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, and then you've got bent, which is the middle,

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and then you've got twisted, which is like the heart...

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Twisted!

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're coming to work!

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I mean, you can actually measure when you reach each of these phases.

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you're someone who just smokes a little weed every now and then, you're bent.

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you're someone who just drinks every now and then, you're bent.

308
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you're someone who does both, but not together,

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you're like, you know, you're like getting there.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're like, you're turnt, you're turnt, you're turnt at that point.

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But if you do them both at once, you are twisted.

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're twisted, man!

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That sounds good to me.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Are you straight-edge?

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, I am worthless.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Everyone, please, in the comments, let me know, are you straight-edge,

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
bent, turnt, or twisted?

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hashtag bent, turnt, etc.

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Also post that on Twitter with those hashtags and make those memes.

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Somebody make a graph of this and make that a meme.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was just about to say, check the show.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And make sure you tag us in it, god damn it.

323
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Tag it with PCP, put our logo on there.

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We'll give you the PNG.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There will be a straw pool in the show notes right now.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Click which one you are.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're straight-edge, you're turnt, you're twisted, or you're bent.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There's a straw pool.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Go vote there.

330
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm going to guess right now, majority of the audience is straight-edge.

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm going to go over 50%.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's my guess.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm going to say 40%.

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think we have a lot of, straight-edge, we have a lot of ponsons.

335
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think we have a lot of ponsons who don't comment as much.

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because they're too busy being high.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's possible.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because they're too fucking high, dude.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think it's going to be like 30% straight-edge, then like 30% bent.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then like a little bit of them are twisted, and more of them are twisted.

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think that the sheer scope of the straight-edge selection of our fandom

342
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
will make Ben's gigantic body look minuscule by comparison.

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's what I think.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know why I said that.

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I am a massive human.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I am a Titan.

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So, Ben, do you just like drink regularly?

348
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Not even that.

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, you know, I go through phases with stuff.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I will go like a long time without like drinking or smoking.

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And then at some point maybe I'll pick one up.

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I forgot you smoked.

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll do it for a while.

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, yeah, tobacco.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't think we don't like it.

356
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Wait, wait, wait.

357
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Where does vape fall?

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, where does vape fall on the straight-edge, too?

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay, yeah, people argue about that.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think that the evidence is pretty good that vape is, if not like healthy.

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
At least not anything you really need to worry about health-wise.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
People fucking try to debate me about that.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Cures cancer.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Cures cancer.

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So, you know, I guess that, I guess, I don't know.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know where that falls.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean, we don't do that much bad either.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, I'll go for long periods without doing it.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll go for long periods without doing anything like that.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And like, I don't like doing it.

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It doesn't feel good.

373
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And like, I feel worse about myself when I do it.

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because it is.

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's just a big waste of time.

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a big waste of money.

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Waste of money.

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I only do it when I'm sad and when I feel like life isn't worth living anyway.

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, we'll see that.

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, that's no good.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's no good.

383
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's your body telling you to stop.

384
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You need to listen to what your body is saying to you.

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
My body is saying, destroy thyself.

386
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If somebody's doing drugs because they just want to have a great time, that's one thing.

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If someone does drugs as a retreat from the real world, I mean, that, to me, seems like

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that's the biggest thing to be avoided.

389
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, drugs have never been that enjoyable.

390
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've done some drugs, like drug drugs, that have made me trip balls.

391
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I haven't really liked it or wanted to do much of it.

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Picture Ben, picture Ben downing a Tylenol, stepping into a room full of little marbles,

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and just be like, I'm tripping balls!

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Whoa!

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It falls into a ball pit hilariously.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, that was Ben.

397
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I drank two rock stars in a row, and I had visions.

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I shucked two Advils onto the hibachi grill, and I soaked those in as my whole.

399
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I gotta say about that thing about whether or not weed is like healthy.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I have smoked literally every day this year.

401
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like, there's not been a day that I have not been high for most of the day.

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I gotta tell you, it is definitely not good for your lungs or throat to smoke.

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There you go.

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, there is no shit, dude.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I would even say it's really bad for your lungs and throat to smoke.

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't want to make this into a dark place, but Digi's voice has undergone something of a transformation in the last while,

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
which is another reason you should stop.

408
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
First of all, I think my voice sounds great.

409
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I mean, I sound like shit right now because I literally took a world-ending bong rip at the start of the show.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But that's what I mean.

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's not as though it permanently damages your throat.

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I mean, it can eventually erode your throat away.

413
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If I were to smoke the way I am now for the next 20 years,

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I will sound like fucking Johnny Cash on his deathbed or fucking...

415
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Sure.

416
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What's his name?

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The...

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Gotta be a chocolate Jesus.

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You know what I'm talking about?

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Uh, no.

421
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Fuck it.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
George Harrison.

423
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, no, Tom Waits.

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's the guy.

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll sound like Tom Waits if I fucking do this for that long.

426
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
However, and I don't intend to, this is just because I'm like,

427
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I just discovered it and it's fun and I can get away with it for like three or four years, you know?

428
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Until I have...

430
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Three or four years, okay.

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, once I have kids, I'm not gonna smoke weed all the fucking time.

432
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But...

433
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So...

434
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's...

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sorry.

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
My fucking mind just would completely blank.

437
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, we're just talking about throat.

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If it's hurt, if there are horrible health effects.

439
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes, it fucking...

440
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It definitely hurts like to...

441
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When you take a gigantic rip, you're going to like...

442
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I have coughed up, like, I've like vomited from my lungs.

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Like, I've vomited flat.

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, boy.

445
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And that shit is disgusting and it hurts.

446
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

447
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And some...

448
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And if you go out in the cold, while you have like, smoking your lungs,

449
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
it fucking hardens in your lungs and it feels like you're dying.

450
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So don't do that.

451
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
When I was in Poland, I would smoke on my balcony.

452
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And it was winter time.

453
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I was there in Poland in the winter.

454
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And as you can imagine, it was bitterly cold.

455
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And from smoking on my porch in the bitter cold,

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I developed a cough that lasted for months.

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, even into the spring and summer, I was still coughing

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
from how much I had fucked up my insides doing that.

459
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think it was mostly the cold, actually.

460
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But the smoking, surely, didn't help.

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And that's my story.

462
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Drugs are great.

463
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Drugs are really nice because they give you a fleeting satisfaction.

464
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's really nice.

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And it gives you cough for literal months afterwards.

466
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's a real...

467
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

468
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Guys, I don't know if this...

470
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know, it's a trade-off, but it's worth it.

471
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I was still on the search for C. Penis inside of vagina on YouTube.

473
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I found a video called...

474
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I found it immediately.

475
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, I actually didn't find it, but I found another one

476
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
called Two Brother Inside She-Elephant Vagina.

477
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And there's a man inside She-Elephant Vagina.

478
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I didn't see that T-Bap episode.

479
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I didn't see...

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, that was the...

481
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You know what?

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll just link it to you.

483
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know, like, will we get in trouble if we put this in the show notes?

484
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Because it's on YouTube.

485
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It is a man inside an elephant vagina getting fucked

486
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and the elephant comes all over him inside the elephant vagina.

487
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Wait, the guy is getting fucked?

488
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This is from, like, a movie.

489
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

490
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Wait, the guy is...

491
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't understand.

492
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is he...

493
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You know what?

494
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This is fucking madness.

495
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How does he breathe?

496
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not clicking on it.

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, it's a pretty big hole.

498
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No, no, no.

499
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The guy is that...

500
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's...

501
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm not clicking on it.

502
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There's a man inside of an elephant's vagina

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and the elephant is getting fucked by another elephant.

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So there's a gigantic dick, like, passing over his head

505
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and coming all over him.

506
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's right.

507
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
How does he not...

508
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Just watch the clip.

509
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's right there.

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't want to watch the fucking clip.

511
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Look, there's a lot of room.

512
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
There's a lot of room in there.

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's not, like, real.

514
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's like a goofy comedy movie, like, retarded, fucking...

515
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It looks fake as shit.

516
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Wait, is it Freddy Got Fingered?

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It looks like...

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's similar to Freddy Got Fingered.

519
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't know.

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I haven't seen that movie, so maybe...

521
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh, I just saw the computer.

522
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, it's pretty...

523
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, you know what?

524
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This has nothing to do with drugs.

525
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh, hey, how about porn?

526
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Porn's a drug on your brain, right?

527
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It kind of is.

528
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Probably, yeah.

529
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, here.

530
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Let's change the order here.

531
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's get back on fucking track.

532
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I want to say my opening statement.

533
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Weed use...

534
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And again, this is going to be, like, the weed cast.

535
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Weed use is not inherently a problem.

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's weed overuse is the problem.

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't care if you're...

538
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't know if you're...

539
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What's the term?

540
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Bent.

541
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I don't care if you're bent.

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I just want to smoke a bowl sometimes.

543
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't want to be around you while you're high, but, like, you know, whatever.

544
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't care.

545
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But when you are twisted, when you reach digilevels, that's the point when shit starts to go south

546
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and I start not wanting to be around you or associate you.

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, shit.

548
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, no.

549
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
This is the intervention.

550
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean, I know what you mean.

551
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I know what you mean.

552
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I had a friend, Nick, when I was young, who...

553
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We would, like, do weed occasionally, and he would just be around and watch everybody,

554
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
like, get high, and he just enjoyed observing and being, like, the one non-high guy.

555
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So there's an element of that that's kind of fun.

556
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's, like, when Tails gets trolled, when Tails and Cheeto Man are, you know, they're

557
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
trying to get high and Doug Funny wants to hang out and smoke weed with them, and everyone's

558
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
like, oh, we don't want to hang out with Doug, but Cheeto Man's like, nah, Doug's cool, Doug's

559
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
cool, but then Doug gets too high and gets really weird about the time that Skeeter gave

560
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
him a handjob, and then he bites Spyro's dog, and then he throws up from weed, and Tails

561
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
makes fun of him for being a lightweight.

562
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't know what the relevance of this story.

563
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I just wanted to talk about that for a while.

564
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What's that flaky lecture coming out?

565
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Probably in, like, a week.

566
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay, cool.

567
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Maybe even by the time this is out.

568
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Tails gets trolled like that.

569
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know, Munchy Electro out now, everybody.

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Munchy Electro's out on his channel, so go watch that shit.

571
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Hey, you have to send that to Dick, did you?

572
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, I did already.

573
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, there you go.

574
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There you go.

575
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay, what were we talking about, Munchy?

576
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We're talking about how I don't think weed uses a problem, but I think that weed overuses

577
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
a problem.

578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's a matter of scales.

579
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
A different amount comes a different in kind.

580
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, you know, here's the real shit here is, like, what does someone want to do with

581
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
their time?

582
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like, I don't think it's fair to criticize people, even if someone who gets blasted out

583
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
of their mind every single day and just doesn't do anything productive.

584
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I mean, this is just how I feel about life in general.

585
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm totally, like, egalitarian here, or libertarian here.

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
As long as you're handling your shit, what business is it of mine?

587
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Like, what you do with your free time?

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's got nothing to do with me.

589
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I would imagine that would not be your position, because I thought you want people to be productive

590
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and just do their work.

591
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I do want people to be productive.

592
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There's two things happening here.

593
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
On the one hand, people can do whatever they want with their life, and I would like them

594
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
to be productive, but on the other hand, if you come to me, having not been productive

595
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and say, listen, I didn't get my life together, please help me, I will look down and I will

596
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
say no.

597
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I will say die.

598
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I will say no.

599
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I mean, I gotta tell you that, like, weed has made me way more productive than before,

600
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
so, like...

601
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Well, that's what I'm saying, you know?

602
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If a person can do weed and be more productive, fantastic.

603
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
If they do weed and they're not productive, I mean, that's their business to work out.

604
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The great thing about being high all day is that you pretty much can't really go anywhere

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
or do anything, so all you really can do is work.

606
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's like, I'm just here at my desk with what's in front of me.

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I know I want to do at least eight hours of work today, so let's just get extremely blasted

608
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and zoned in, put on some good music, and fucking just work all day, you know?

609
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So, that's been just like every single day for as long as I can remember at this point.

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Great.

611
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Which is like three minutes, basically.

612
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, so, we can't judge what your life is like.

613
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because I have three cells left.

614
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Sure, but you're basically a public artist, so, like, you know, that works for you.

615
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You can do those sorts of things, and we obviously don't have insight into, like, your day-to-day

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
life, but we can see what's been produced, and so that's the one window that we have

617
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
to, like, critique, such as it is, you know, this change in lifestyle.

618
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
There are two pillars that hold up my entire being, and this goes back to the very episode.

619
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There are two, like, tenets of my entire personality that are completely contradictory to one another,

620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and I have to battle them on a daily basis.

621
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The first pillar is you can do whatever you want, and the second pillar is don't be retarded.

622
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And those are clashing constantly.

623
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I agree, sure. People can do what they want in their free time, you know, sure.

624
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's if it's recreational, you know, whatever.

625
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But I don't want to be around people who are retarded, and I think it negatively impacts them

626
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
on a social, economical, and just, like, physical well-being.

627
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I think it affects them on multiple levels.

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So, like, sure, I'm not gonna fucking call the police, but I think that you probably should

629
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
probably think twice, and this is my opinion, so I'm gonna fucking say it.

630
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You know, I hear you on that, Munchy. It reminds me a little bit of something, though.

631
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think you're being a little bit, I mean, it's totally understandable,

632
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and, like, you're probably right about most people doing these sorts of things.

633
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But then, I think to myself, you know, not everybody fits the exact mold,

634
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and really, like, what they should do is necessarily in line with, like,

635
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
what the most average person in society should do,

636
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
aka, like, you know, not go crazy doing drugs.

637
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, like, I'm thinking of, for example, I was on Twitter yesterday,

638
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and I tweeted out, like, a video from Whiplash,

639
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
where the kid, the main kid, like, breaks up with his girlfriend,

640
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
because he's like, listen, all I care about in life is drumming.

641
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That's all I want to do. Therefore, I don't have time for a relationship,

642
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
so I'm ending it here. And, like, the girl, I mean, and just everyone's response,

643
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I tweeted out about how inspirational I found that,

644
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and, you know, I didn't really articulate, because it's Twitter,

645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
exactly in what ways I like that.

646
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I just admire his, like, commitment to his goals.

647
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But then, like, everyone starts being like, um, actually, he, like, is really shit,

648
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and he shouldn't have done that, because it's, like, bad, and you need to live a balanced life,

649
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and, like, sure, if you, if you, like, are a normal fag, then, yeah,

650
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you'll probably be happiest in life doing that sort of thing.

651
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This is why I fucking hated The Princess and the Frog,

652
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
because in the end, the message was, like, if you don't have love,

653
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
you can't just be a strong, powerful woman.

654
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I straight up, that is my favorite Disney movie, because I just ignore the ending,

655
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and I just don't, I do not learn, I just watch the beginning,

656
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and I'm like, this is the perfect woman, I love Tiana so much, et cetera, et cetera.

657
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Uh, so, like, people, people are really eager.

658
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
My point is that people are really eager to, like, want to say that, you know,

659
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
people should live their life, that's exactly it.

660
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But there are lots of individuals, like, in Digi's lifestyle,

661
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it seems to me that doing lots of weeds is not going to inherently be necessarily a problem

662
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
to a degree, to a degree.

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because there are things like, well, yeah, go on, Munchy.

664
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Two things to that. First of all, this is anything different than the Furious episode.

665
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
This is, like, a blanket statement to appeal to the general audience here.

666
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There will be outliers, there are people who do not, you know,

667
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
even though they are twisted, they live perfectly, like, serviceable lives,

668
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
there are tons of musicians and things who smoke weed, and, you know,

669
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
the fucking Beatles smoke the Bola Day, and, you know, they're the Beatles, so it's fine.

670
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I was about to go into a point about that, because, like, as much as I absolutely...

671
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Whoa, fucking hold on, bitch, I was in the middle of a two-point thing.

672
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, okay, Gib will go after, just hang on, put a pin in that.

673
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, yeah, so there's, like, you know, you can...

674
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They couldn't smoke on a Bola Day.

675
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's a matter of scale, it's a matter of overuse,

676
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and it's a matter of, like, not just, you know, doing it because you want to,

677
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it's a matter of overuse and me being around you.

678
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So, like...

679
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, okay, are you being selfish there, though?

680
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You're saying what you want them to do for your benefit.

681
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What has this entire podcast lead up to this point B?

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's us shouting our opinion at the audience, and pretending that it's not correct,

683
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and what should have happened.

684
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That's what this entire podcast has been for, like, what, like, 100 episodes now?

685
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Why now is this a problem? Why now is me saying what I think the world should be?

686
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Now, like, suddenly, like, twisted and, you know, devilish.

687
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because your reasoning is that you want to impose your standards on other people,

688
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and, you know...

689
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Nate, that's what you do every day, and that's not a problem.

690
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's just how you believe.

691
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Well, I don't know. I feel like I'm pretty careful to make sure that people understand.

692
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Nate, you are right now imposing the belief of, like...

693
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That people should do what they want, that's right.

694
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah, exactly. As opposed to, like, the, you know,

695
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
if Munchie holds totalitarian beliefs that we all need to be, like, under God,

696
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and that, like, he was imposing the belief that Munchie should win.

697
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Stop trying to fucking now.

698
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm not saying I want to ban every, every, like, ounce of weed on the place.

699
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
No, no, no. I was just, I wasn't saying you actually thought that I was being rhetorical.

700
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Of course.

701
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, okay, Gib was chiming in with something.

702
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What about the beans? Tell us.

703
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Well, it was, it was...

704
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The thing that I have is that, as much as I absolutely hate to admit it,

705
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
weed and drugs and mind-altering substances,

706
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
despite how much I hate this idea,

707
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
do actually result in artists being really creative and cool.

708
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They have and will and do result in really cool stuff.

709
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But the problem I find with, like, things

710
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
is that people aren't doing the hard stuff anymore.

711
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I think people should be stopping weed because it's baby shit.

712
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's too, it's too weak. It's got, it's got two, three of the letters in week are in the year.

713
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Three of them?

714
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Wait, only two.

715
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No, three.

716
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's most of them.

717
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Wait, like, like, weak as in, like, seven days?

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I mean, that's accurate.

719
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes.

720
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And, and fucking, they should be doing,

721
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
they should be doing the hard stuff.

722
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They should be doing LSD.

723
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They should be doing acid.

724
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
PCP.

725
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Fucking PCP, Red Bull, like, all that really dangerous about the world to you.

726
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I find...

727
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So that we can make, like, new, new Beatles stuff, new Pink Floyds.

728
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, again, again.

729
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Like, I want people to be incredible.

730
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But the thing is, weed is, like, quantity over quality.

731
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
People smoke all the time and it's the amount of time that they're out of commission.

732
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
They're not really more creative.

733
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They're just sort of, like, ugh.

734
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But they're not, like, they're not, like, putting themselves at risk.

735
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They're like, if they put themselves at risk,

736
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
they would die more and they would be doing less all the parts of the day.

737
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll tell you, because as you experienced firsthand,

738
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
because you tried to smoke with me and you kind of didn't have that much

739
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and it didn't end up getting you high at all, right?

740
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah.

741
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And it very much is just like drinking.

742
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's like, how much you put in is how much you get out.

743
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You can have a couple beers and get a light buzz and just, you know, carry about your day.

744
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You can have three or four beers and be like,

745
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
hey, I'm having a party or you can get obliterated

746
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and, like, you're gonna be the life of the party,

747
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
but you might not remember it tomorrow, so it's a risk, you know?

748
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And with weed, if you get that high,

749
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
like, you get so high that you're gonna, like, see shit

750
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and, like, really fucking deeply experience the media you watch and all that shit,

751
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
like, you have to be willing to risk the fact that you're gonna be on a bad fucking, like,

752
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you're gonna think about a lot of shit you didn't want to think about

753
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
about your past and all the worst things that have happened in your life

754
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and, like, how you're a piece of shit

755
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and you can't escape that mind prison and you'll be there for hours.

756
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Like, if you cross that threshold into being what I call mega-big-high,

757
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
if you are mega-big-high, you're going to just cross over into this other world

758
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
of which there's no escape and that's why most people I think, like me,

759
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
who the first time I smoked, I got that high and it was, like, fucking nightmare,

760
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
people who tend to end up that high when they smoke are just like,

761
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't want to do it regularly, because...

762
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That's how I felt when I did it.

763
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Right, exactly.

764
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I feel like people, like, I like munchy.

765
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't like people who smoke.

766
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I don't like the smell.

767
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The smell is like, I mean, I have a story about why I hate the smell,

768
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
which I can get into later, but, like, the...

769
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I don't like hanging around people who are, like, intoxicated or in some way

770
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
slightly beyond normal.

771
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Well, I don't like that person.

772
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So I would prefer people to just not drink and smoke, like, every day,

773
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
but to do it, like, once a month, but get so drunk or so high

774
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that they do something incredible.

775
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I would prefer it to be, like, an explosive thing,

776
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
rather than just, like, a small burn throughout the entire of their life.

777
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like, if you're, like, out dealing with people who are, like, drunk or high

778
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and, like, you don't know them, like, I personally am pretty wary of, like, just...

779
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You know, because they're unpredictable and it's like, well, I don't know.

780
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I do not want to interact with any, like, higher drunk strangers.

781
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't understand, like, the idea of going to a place where, like,

782
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you know everyone's drunk and you don't know who any of them are,

783
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
but, like, everyone there is volatile and, like...

784
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah.

785
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Like, if I'm going to be...

786
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's like the club.

787
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
If I'm going to be super drunk or high, I'd prefer to be those around people I know

788
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and trust because I'm in a more vulnerable state, you know?

789
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, totally.

790
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But Gib, Gib, let me just...

791
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I just want to clarify with Gib on one thing, because I just want to...

792
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I liked his point and I want to expand on it because I think I agree with it.

793
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's like, so, Gib, you were saying before about, like, you think people are just, like,

794
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
they're doing it too much and they're, I don't know, maybe you mean, like, using it as a crutch.

795
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's quite a quality of a quality.

796
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Like, the amount of hours you spend doing that thing when you could be, like,

797
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you know, chugging a big old whiskey bottle and going insane just one time a month instead.

798
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, well, okay, I see what you mean by that.

799
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And that's basically more efficient.

800
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What I see, actually, there's a lot of people I respect in the world,

801
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like musicians and whatnot, who do a lot of drugs, and that's all fine.

802
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You know, the Beatles did it in their most famous band ever.

803
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Like, to me, the way I think of it is, there are, like, people alive right now.

804
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Like, guys like Sam Harris, for example, who, he's a neuroscientist,

805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and he has done a bunch of drugs, because he's, like, an atheist.

806
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He doesn't believe in free will.

807
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know, I find him a pretty inspiring guy.

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And he has done really hard drugs.

809
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But the point is, like, he's such a serious guy.

810
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And he has, like, put in the work to put himself in a place.

811
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Like, he's gone, like, as far as he could go, like, practicing, like, meditation and yoga

812
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
as a way to, like, understand human consciousness, which he's really interested in.

813
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But then, like, you get really far with that path.

814
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And then you start to, like, your gains start to level off from your understanding.

815
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And once you've, like, become self-disciplined and you've done this research,

816
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it's at that point where I think using drugs to then push yourself harder

817
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
than, like, a human being could go, now that you've put yourself in a position

818
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
where you can actually capitalize on this.

819
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like, then doing drugs makes sense, because then you'll really be able to appreciate it.

820
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Whereas opposed to, like, if you've got, like, an 18-year-old college dropout,

821
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
or 20-year-old college dropout, just sitting at home is like,

822
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
yeah, I'm gonna do weed, and I'm gonna be, like, the greatest musician of all time.

823
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like, never practices, like, never do anything.

824
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's definitely a part of the aspect of, like, the things.

825
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Like, if you're the sort of person who, obviously, is dangerous,

826
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
but, like, it does have, like, more impressive results than just doing a weed every so often.

827
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I want to, I want to see it.

828
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
To do an LSD.

829
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I want us to get away from the, like, the, both the artist and the burnout side of it for a bit,

830
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because those are kind of, I think, like, stereotypes about, like, people who smoke weed.

831
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But I think the vast majority of people who smoke weed are just normies

832
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
who smoke it to literally, like, because they work a normal ass job

833
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and they don't do anything afterwards, you know?

834
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Wait, hippo, I just want to say that I don't even disagree with you.

835
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I have that right down here on my notes.

836
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
That, like, again, it's, like, if you're an artist and you want to take a weed or LSD,

837
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
you know, like, you know, twice a month or whatever, I don't, you know,

838
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't have hard numbers or anything.

839
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But, you know, if you want to take it every once in a while, casually, I have no problem with that.

840
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's just when it becomes a part of your identity,

841
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
becomes a part of yourself, becomes something that you do every day,

842
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
part of your routine.

843
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
If you can't eat without weed, you cannot fuel your body.

844
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If you cannot intake sustenance without weed, that's when it comes up.

845
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, you got a problem. You got a problem there.

846
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Uh, yeah, yeah.

847
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's why I was saying to close out that so you can go on whatever the hell you want.

848
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, anyway, I think most people who smoke are just, like,

849
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and this is the reason that 420 is, like, such a symbolic number.

850
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Like, what it really means at the core is because it's right after you get home from work.

851
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Like, that's the idea.

852
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You get home at four o'clock, you roll up a joint for the next 20 minutes,

853
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and then you smoke at 420.

854
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's a way that normal people who live without much to do, like, to entertain themselves,

855
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
like, especially poor people, like, is the, you know, the most people who smoke weed,

856
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because you can just relax and, you know, just sit around and do whatever,

857
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
watch the regular ass TV or whatever the fuck you do.

858
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Um, same reason other people do this with a six-pack, you know,

859
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
guys who come home by a six-pack of beer and they drink a six-pack every single fucking night

860
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
because they just work at the shipyard and they come home and watch TV all night,

861
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you know, and then they get fat and have kids and they continue doing this until they die.

862
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I have a suggestion for these people, though.

863
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They should, instead of doing that and spending all that money on weed and whatnot,

864
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
they should come home, like, have an internet subscription,

865
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
just, like, do, play some relaxing music, whatever you want to do,

866
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and take that money that you would have spent on weed and put it in the bank,

867
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
put in a 401k, save that shit for retirement, my dude.

868
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You'll feel so much better.

869
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, these people might not have a...

870
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's kind of a big ask to have a reliable internet connection.

871
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
To have a bank account? Is that really much...

872
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Wait, the internet connection is not...

873
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The internet connection was the part I was talking about.

874
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Well, I mean, we're talking about people in first world countries here.

875
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I think that's not...

876
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, we are.

877
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I mean, we're talking about...

878
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I feel like a lot of people would, when they retire,

879
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
would just want to sit around smoking weed anyway.

880
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I can't go into this conversation without just bringing in my baggage

881
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
of how much happier I think everyone is when they're using their time

882
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
as productively as possible.

883
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I just think that makes people happier.

884
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I mean, I don't begrudge people having something to wind down

885
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
after a long day of work.

886
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Of course not.

887
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I just don't think that...

888
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't think most people have the capacity to do what you're suggesting, Nate.

889
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like, I don't think a lot of people literally...

890
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
To save money?

891
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I think that most people do not have...

892
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, yeah, definitely not to save money.

893
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Most people do not have the cognitive capacity to save money,

894
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
nor to have a second life outside of work.

895
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Like, most people come home and they're just fucking exhausted and done,

896
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and they just want to kick up and not think about anything

897
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
because they do not have those kinds of complicated thoughts

898
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that lead people down other paths.

899
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So boring.

900
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So boring.

901
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's unfortunate, but like, these people...

902
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
These are the people who need this shit the most

903
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
because all we need them for is to be the worker ants

904
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
running our colony of the fucking world.

905
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like, all these...

906
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I mean, the worth of normies in society

907
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
is that someone's got to run all this shit.

908
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We don't...

909
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Us intellectuals who just want to go to a Walmart

910
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and like fucking...

911
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
If you...

912
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
If you...

913
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yo, catch me an intellectual at Walmart.

914
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
If you have the IQ that you can watch Rick and Morty

915
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and you just want to like hop down to the Walmart

916
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and grab a fucking, you know, a quick case of whatever

917
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
soda fucking caffeinated thing you need to get through your day,

918
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
someone has to be there to sell that shit to you.

919
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And that person, like, needs to be there every single day

920
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
doing this demeaning job that has to exist,

921
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
but like, so, you know, these people...

922
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
We need these people and we got to keep them satiated.

923
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We got to make sure that they're not fucking pissed

924
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
because if they're pissed, they rise up.

925
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Well, you know, Digi?

926
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You know, Digi?

927
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That's all the reason.

928
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's the only way to fulfill your life.

929
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's not the only way to get dopamine.

930
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This is why...

931
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah, but it's a good way.

932
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's a cheap way.

933
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
The most important thing is that we need to get post-scarcity

934
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
so that people, even these people,

935
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
can choose to not waste their lives

936
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
as shitty jobs like this.

937
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I figured out how to like replace weed

938
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
as like a way to give people the dopamine rush that they need.

939
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Fucking make playplaces for adults.

940
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Finally, please.

941
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I just want to go in one of those...

942
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I want to be like, you are old enough to be in here.

943
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
In fact, you're too old,

944
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and that's why you're allowed in here, yes.

945
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Incidentally, something that I want everyone to understand,

946
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and this is part of why I started smoking so much weed,

947
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
is that when I went to Portland

948
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and I saw what it was like there,

949
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I realized that when weed is legal everywhere,

950
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
fucking everyone will be high most of the time

951
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
because it's super cheap

952
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and it just puts you in a better mood

953
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and it gets you through the day

954
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and no reason people won't do it

955
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
because if you have a...

956
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
especially in a city like that where there's good public transit,

957
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
you don't have to drive anywhere

958
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
so there's no reason you wouldn't just go around high all the time.

959
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So that's what it's going to be like

960
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and the reason is that the amount that I smoke in a day,

961
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and I smoke a hell of a lot of weed,

962
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
but I smoke an amount that's equivalent to buying a Big Mac once a day.

963
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's not...

964
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But only if you're somewhere where it's legal.

965
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's not true where I live.

966
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I pay way the fuck more for weed

967
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
because it's not fully...

968
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
it's not sold in dispensaries here.

969
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But in places where it's legal, it's so cheap

970
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that everyone's going to be doing it all the time

971
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and when I realize that that's where the tide's turning,

972
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
that's going to be...

973
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that already is normal in some places

974
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and will be normal everywhere in America soon,

975
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
there's no reason to even think of it as differently than that.

976
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Richie, why are you concerned with being normal?

977
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Why are you concerned with being a little bit normal?

978
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Well, I'm concerned with it because of the fact

979
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
that I am terrified of doing anything illegal

980
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and I have never been someone who does illegal illicit activities,

981
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
except for in the most safe conditions imaginable.

982
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I think you're being really selfish here.

983
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Think of all those hard-working cartel members in Mexico right now

984
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and we're going to put them out of a fucking job

985
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
if we legalize weed.

986
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We can't do that.

987
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
How can we do that to them?

988
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Fuck them.

989
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Fuck them.

990
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We'll replace them with robot cartels.

991
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We have to keep the cartels.

992
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We keep the cartels, we automate their job.

993
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, and then we just tell them...

994
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, robots aren't allowed to kill people.

995
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Replace the poor with poor robots.

996
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
To the people who come home tired after work,

997
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I don't...

998
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I sympathize.

999
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I sympathize with them.

1000
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I understand why they would want it to happen.

1001
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But what I would suggest is that you should go outside

1002
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
or get a hobby, because I know what it's like.

1003
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
What if you live somewhere where you go outside and you get shot?

1004
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The internet, man. The internet.

1005
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Maybe it's idealistic and maybe it's...

1006
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't know.

1007
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe I'm coming from a place of...

1008
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I hate the Procrasteers podcast.

1009
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I fucking hate it.

1010
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I can't get through a single point without literally every single host

1011
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
constantly cutting me off for no reason.

1012
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'll be in the middle of a fucking sentence.

1013
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And everyone, like vultures, trying to jump on me

1014
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and cannibalize my point.

1015
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The point where it's unrecognizable.

1016
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I don't get a single word in edgewise.

1017
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The point that I'm trying to make is why I don't...

1018
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I won't be able to go outside, because I know what it's like to be inside all the time.

1019
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I know what it's like to be inside and be just...

1020
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And not do anything.

1021
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I know what that feels like.

1022
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
For myself, I think that's what's best is to go outside and get a hobby

1023
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and do what you love and do art or something.

1024
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I know it's a blanket statement that's what should be done for everyone.

1025
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Sure, there are outliers, but I shouldn't even say that.

1026
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I shouldn't even start up with my movie review.

1027
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
This is just my opinion, guys.

1028
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Everyone's top ten list will be the same.

1029
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That's a given in this climate.

1030
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
This is a conversation about weed.

1031
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
We're talking...

1032
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
We're having a conversation about what we're trying to find these lines.

1033
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This is literally the purpose of this conversation,

1034
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
where is the line, when is it okay,

1035
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
what is the parameters of how people should use it.

1036
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The reason I'm bringing up these talking points

1037
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
is that I'm literally just talking about shit that literally every rapper raps about.

1038
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The reason weed is talked about so much in rap music

1039
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
is it's almost always presented as,

1040
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
this is the way that our people get through life,

1041
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is that we have nothing and this is what can make us happy.

1042
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
They probably have a little bit more,

1043
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
if they save a bit of all that money that they spend buying weed,

1044
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
to advance their careers,

1045
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
or try and move out of their terrible neighborhood,

1046
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or invest in whatever...

1047
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
That's what Jay-Z says.

1048
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
How much money do you think you're going to save

1049
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
by putting away a little bit of weed?

1050
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Jay-Z encourages smoking weed,

1051
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
but he does encourage not buying dumb bullshit like expensive cars

1052
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and frivolous spending.

1053
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Alright, here's the difference between getting some weed

1054
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and then getting some nice soda that you like.

1055
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There's no difference.

1056
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's the same...

1057
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That's why I compared it to a Big Mac.

1058
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
People buy these things because it's a step up from,

1059
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
like, gruel, it's a step up from,

1060
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I have to eat Pop Tarts and Ramen,

1061
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but it's...

1062
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
For me, growing up,

1063
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
getting to eat fast food was something special, right?

1064
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We wanted...

1065
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That was better than at home dinner,

1066
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
at least in my household.

1067
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
My parents can't cook for shit.

1068
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And we were poor for a lot of times,

1069
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
so we just ate crackers, nothing.

1070
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So going to a...

1071
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And we were a bunch of skinny, picky kids.

1072
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Even if we had options, we wouldn't have eaten any of it.

1073
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
We would just go to McDonald's and be like,

1074
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
wow, this is a step up, this is a real meal that I'm enjoying.

1075
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And now as an adult, I see that it's like disgusting filth

1076
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that I wouldn't touch because I know A, how to cook,

1077
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and B, I can go to a better restaurant.

1078
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But when you're in a situation where you don't...

1079
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I'm so hungry.

1080
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You know, I'm getting...

1081
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm actually making myself really hungry, too.

1082
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I lost my point in train of thought.

1083
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, you know, that was a very interesting point there.

1084
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The difference between weed and soda

1085
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
is that you don't get high from soda,

1086
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and that you don't get, like,

1087
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
a dopamine rush in your mind from soda.

1088
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's actually not...

1089
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I mean, I feel that way when I haven't had soda

1090
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
for like a month, and then I drink my first one.

1091
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's how I feel when I drink a soda.

1092
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
When you're not desensitized...

1093
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You get fucking high from drinking a Dr. Pepper?

1094
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
When I'm really desensitized,

1095
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm somebody who reacts really strongly

1096
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
to any kind of stimulus.

1097
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I drink a sip of an energy drink,

1098
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and I feel like my whole vision changes.

1099
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
That's the level, because I don't drink it that much.

1100
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But when you get yourself desensitized to something,

1101
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it loses that effect.

1102
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
When I drink it, there's been times

1103
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
where I'm drinking Mountain Dew every single day,

1104
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and I need it just to get through the day,

1105
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and when I stop having it, I feel miserable,

1106
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and then I fucking scrounge together

1107
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
whatever money I could find.

1108
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
This is something I actually did when my parents

1109
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
cut me off from Mountain Dew one time.

1110
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I was just fucking scrounging together dollars

1111
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
to ride my bike to 7-Eleven

1112
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
to secretly, covertly buy it,

1113
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because I was so addicted to it.

1114
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But when I stopped drinking it,

1115
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
the next time I had it over a year later,

1116
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
it was like, oh my God,

1117
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the sugar in this is so overwhelming.

1118
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You gotta drink that diet, dude, dude.

1119
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's all about the diet, dude.

1120
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm fucking feast of the diet.

1121
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I will proselytize the diet soda is the greatest.

1122
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's a fucking miracle.

1123
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I just went through this myself.

1124
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I never drink soda.

1125
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I barely eat sugary stuff,

1126
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
but just fucking...

1127
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I bought a high-ball, organic,

1128
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
grapefruit juice energy drink,

1129
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and I drank, it's got 40 grams of sugar in it.

1130
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
40 fucking grams.

1131
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So, for me, like, a dessert,

1132
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
a glass of orange juice is so rich.

1133
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's so rich.

1134
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It is my cake,

1135
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
a fucking glass of orange juice.

1136
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And this high-ball energy drink is the same.

1137
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I think the thing Munchie was getting at, though,

1138
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
is like, weed gets you high

1139
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
in, like, a very specific way

1140
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
that, like, you can be,

1141
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
like, completely incapacitated

1142
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
if you're the sort of person

1143
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
who, like, reacts that way to it.

1144
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Ben, what are you laughing about?

1145
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I just envisioned a world where, like,

1146
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Nate's eating his beans, right?

1147
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But it's, like, his day of the month

1148
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
that he's gonna treat himself.

1149
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So he sneaks a jelly bean

1150
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
in there among the regular beans.

1151
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Oh, no.

1152
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And then, you know, he's...

1153
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But he doesn't know where it is.

1154
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And it comes to surprise,

1155
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and when he hits that secret jelly bean,

1156
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it's the ultimate coom.

1157
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Dude, that...

1158
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's like when you finally bite into that cyanide capsule

1159
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you've hidden in your teeth, and I just die.

1160
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
That's what it's like.

1161
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That's a funny issue.

1162
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
He's just got a bunch of frijoles negros

1163
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
and he just throws one sweet, delicious

1164
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
licorice jelly bean in there.

1165
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Everybody's favorite.

1166
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yo.

1167
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Okay, but here's the real question.

1168
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Was he saying something?

1169
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
The thing I was saying is that I feel like

1170
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
if weed became, like,

1171
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
one of the many things

1172
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
you could just go into the convenience store

1173
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and buy, like, you get a chocolate bar,

1174
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
a chocolate candy bar,

1175
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
something, a thing, a soda,

1176
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and a weed, you know, it's all there.

1177
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's, like, literally what it's like

1178
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
in the places where it's legal.

1179
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Like, the dispensaries you walk in,

1180
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
it's like a bunch of cheery-eyed people come up

1181
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and, like, everything's presented very nicely.

1182
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's like an applesauce point.

1183
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Huh?

1184
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Go on. That was the middle of your point.

1185
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But that's how it goes, baby.

1186
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I was just, you know, telling him about dispensaries.

1187
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
The point was that I think

1188
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it can, I feel like

1189
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
as long as people,

1190
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
like, I don't know actually whether weed

1191
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
is addictive, like, cigarettes are.

1192
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I assume it isn't.

1193
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But, I feel like

1194
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
it wouldn't be that big of a deal

1195
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
if that just became a normal thing, because

1196
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
you know, you just need to

1197
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
anything to realize that

1198
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
anything can be, like, self-destructive

1199
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and, like, can ruin your life

1200
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
and make you retarded if you have too much of it.

1201
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I guess it's just like a thing.

1202
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You've got to make sure that people

1203
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
in general learn

1204
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
not to do big weed all the time, all day,

1205
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
otherwise they won't be able to get anything done.

1206
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Uh, Digi, I'm happy that

1207
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
you compared it to fast food, because that's actually

1208
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
one of my points here. Fast food

1209
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
is great every once in a while. You can walk into

1210
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Chipotle, and Chipotle is, like, one of the best

1211
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
meals that I have, like, every single time.

1212
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It's great. I love Chipotle. But

1213
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
if you eat too much of it, you're going to get fucking fat.

1214
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It's going to affect your overall health, and you're, like,

1215
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
well-being. Like, socially, people are going to make fun of you because you're fat.

1216
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Or, rightfully so. It's going to affect you

1217
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
economically, because you can't spend $10 a day

1218
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
on fucking Chipotle. You can't do that.

1219
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Uh, you know, I mean,

1220
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
that's true. Well, I'm saying you

1221
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
probably should. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's

1222
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
you could, you could make an argument, a sound argument.

1223
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That's a bad investment. And, like, like, the

1224
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
perfect thing to do if you wanted to, even if you

1225
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
want a delicious Chipotle burrito, if you

1226
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
went to the grocery store, bought all the

1227
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
ingredients, and cooked it yourself, it'll cost

1228
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
you more time, for sure, but you'll definitely

1229
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
save money by buying things in bulk and,

1230
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
like, doing it that way. We're entering

1231
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
a weird realm here, because I

1232
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
don't think there's anybody

1233
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
who is so broke

1234
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
that they can't afford

1235
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
to eat Chipotle every day, but

1236
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
has enough money to smoke weed every

1237
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
day. Like, I don't think this

1238
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
person exists. Did you, I'm not saying

1239
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
that they are literally incapable

1240
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
of getting Chipotle every day.

1241
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't think they, they literally do not have the funds

1242
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
to do so. I'm saying it's a smart

1243
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
thing to do. I'm just saying, I'm just saying,

1244
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
like, okay, in my case, for instance,

1245
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I could buy Chipotle every day

1246
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and it would do nothing to my bottom

1247
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
line. Like, it, it is

1248
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
inconsequential for me to spend that money

1249
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
because I make way more money than

1250
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can spend. Like, I

1251
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
live such a small,

1252
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
like, small life that has

1253
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
nothing really behind it. I have a huge

1254
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
savings, um, and

1255
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
you know, every year a huge chunk of it gets taken

1256
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
out for taxes and then it gets replaced. And

1257
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
so, so, like,

1258
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
for me, I could, yeah, I

1259
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
could literally smoke weed or each chipotle

1260
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
or do whatever the fuck I want every day

1261
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
because, like, uh,

1262
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
what is the reason not to do

1263
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
that? You know, I, I, well, you know, I, most

1264
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
people are not afforded. So, I'm speaking to the

1265
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
audience. I mean, I think, I think what's

1266
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
going on here is that you guys are talking

1267
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
slightly about two different things, or at

1268
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
least your, your emphasis is on two different aspects.

1269
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I think that's why there's a little bit of disagreement here.

1270
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I just feel like, if you,

1271
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,480
I don't think there's anybody out there who like is

1272
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:40,600
Smoking that amount of like nobody's smoking as much as I am if they can't afford it. It's what I'm saying like sure

1273
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,840
Sure, I know multiple stoners that are constantly broke. Well, they're then they're fucking idiots

1274
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,840
It's I would say that the weed is not their problem is the fact that they're fucking idiots that this their problem

1275
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,280
I mean, you can make that point about spending their money on weed

1276
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,640
Yeah, because they're I don't agree. I don't agree that they are also stupid. I do I they are stupid

1277
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,920
I know is obviously not no, I would say any look literally

1278
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,840
I'm trying if they can't afford it. That's the problem. Yeah, the thing is like there's people who do that

1279
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,000
my fucking

1280
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:27,040
My fiancee told me about someone she worked with who like her boyfriend had spent all his money on Pokemon plushies

1281
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,160
Like he would literally get a paycheck and immediately drop it all on Pokemon plushies and be broke

1282
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,940
She was like that too, yeah, I love you

1283
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:52,720
People people literally just are bad with money because they don't understand it because probably their parents are bad with money

1284
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,880
And just didn't teach them how to be good with it like the only reason I know anything about money is that my dad who was

1285
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,440
Unbelievably bad with it and put himself in a massive amount of debt in his 30s

1286
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,120
And then spent his 40s working his way out of all the debt and like learning everything about money and finances and taxes

1287
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:15,200
He read literally the entire tax code. So I really should just get him to do my taxes fucking for me, but

1288
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,120
So restraint because show restraint exactly

1289
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
Like if you know how to show

1290
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,120
Resuram show restaurant. Where's restaurant so overprotective of me

1291
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:36,200
Like like basically if I if I stopped like if let's say my patreon took a dip to a point where I thought oh

1292
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,160
Shit, I need to be worried about money now

1293
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,680
We is the first thing that's got to go because it's what I spend the most frivolous money on like I know that it doesn't matter

1294
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,600
How much I smoke I like I could smoke every fucking day and then the second I can't afford it anymore

1295
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,640
It's fucking gone, you know

1296
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:58,680
Well, I don't know if that's a proven fact that you could it's a very proven fact because I stopped drinking Mountain Dew

1297
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,320
I stopped smoking cigarettes

1298
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,880
I stopped doing all kinds of things that I was addicted to because well

1299
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,720
I just thought that it was no longer appropriate cigarettes for like what like four months. I haven't smoked. I haven't smoked again since

1300
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,400
Forever ago, I haven't smoked. Okay, you guys there. There is a difference here

1301
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,760
You guys are basically talking past each other because there's two different things going on here

1302
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Munchie is talking about

1303
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:26,640
Definitely positive possible negative things that could come from like being obsessed with weed and like the fact that there's addictive

1304
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:32,400
Personalities like weed is just like like gambling we shouldn't like outlaw gambling but gambling can have negative consequences

1305
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:39,240
Just by the nature of it existing but but digi here is focused on the positive that weed can do which I think we all agree

1306
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,760
Exactly, I'm just saying that this this personality problem is not a result of any specific

1307
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,160
Drug people will find a way to facilitate this personality problem

1308
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,600
It goes way beyond like people talk about like gambling and weed and all that stuff because it's obvious

1309
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:02,120
But like literally people will just blow their whole paychecks on fucking plushies like people will just spend their money

1310
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,680
Badly because they're trying to fill a hole in their lives that they don't understand how to fill and they sure this is the way to do

1311
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,680
It because they don't understand money. I

1312
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,960
Completely agree. I don't disagree at all

1313
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,960
But like last time so in the first cast we made fun people for making very getting fabulous commissions to spend all the American missions

1314
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,880
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right here right now. I'm yeah, you should not do that. That's not yes

1315
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,440
Do not spend all your money on weed if you cannot afford weed that's retarded

1316
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,840
That might my main my main problem with the weed is is not the time or make a fucking budget

1317
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,920
budget budget

1318
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,380
Should I just to get into my big point get do it man. Let's do it. I'm ready

1319
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,580
All right, all right when you can get high and feel good from just sitting on the couch like twiddling your clip playing the newest

1320
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,080
Hottest like God of War two if you can do that

1321
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,320
Dopamine for doing nothing your incentive to do like actually accomplish the things is diminished

1322
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,240
You're not going to want to put in the hard work and do things that like really matter to me things that really matter to me

1323
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,040
You're going to neglect other aspects of your life that make you feel good like social interaction work, etc

1324
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,960
You can associate the dopamine rush that you get like from the high as rewards

1325
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,480
You look at things that you've done or are doing currently and think wow good job. Like I'm so funny. I'm so much fun here and weed

1326
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,840
I'm so smart. I bet no one would have thought of that Wow

1327
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:23,920
When chances are it's either total bullshit and not good at all or the more like the scenario is it is good

1328
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,800
But you just would have thought about it while you were sober and you're just more impressive than you otherwise would be

1329
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,240
Hmm

1330
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,160
So well, so basically you're making the case just like that that case kind of extends to just like something like video games as well

1331
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:44,080
It's unearned indulgence. It's an indulgence and I don't I don't like the idea of pleasure for nothing

1332
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
I mean, I agree

1333
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:52,160
But the question like the question I think ultimately does come down to basically what we've been saying about like you've got to manage

1334
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,960
That in your life because like weeds just out there and like weed or video games or any kind of drug or indulgence sex

1335
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:06,160
Whatever it is not tell me that drugs are not more potent and easily well like literally released open mean in your brain

1336
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
In the real world

1337
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,720
You can you can get addicted to it like anything that that takes over your life because I don't

1338
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,920
We don't even need to bring in anything else like the fact is that like weed as an example it

1339
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,400
Alone it does do this, you know forget everything else forget drugs

1340
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,600
It does do that and I can see why Munchie would see something like that and the effect it has on the on the world at

1341
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,960
Large and think to himself well this you know, maybe there's some positives here

1342
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,120
But I also see like a whole boatload of negatives coming along with it

1343
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:42,400
I think that is understandable the the the idea that like you can take weed and then find like

1344
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:48,440
The mundane stuff that you think to be like more impressive than it actually is

1345
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,960
To be like that is literally our stereotype

1346
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,760
Right now right now you constantly say that you're fun

1347
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:06,880
You're on weed whenever I wait first of all, I don't even think I act what constantly was an overstatement

1348
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,480
I don't think I even act any different whether I'm high or not. I don't think most people can tell

1349
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,160
I don't think most people have any idea when it's the case

1350
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:20,120
I mean, I hope well that it's been the case every single day since the year started

1351
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,920
So if you just think I've acted literally different in every interaction

1352
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,280
I've had with you since the beginning of the year than fair enough, but like you know

1353
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,720
Well, it could be an overall sort of tonal shift, you know, I don't think that you're

1354
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:40,480
Unrecognizable as did you bro, but I definitely I definitely like like notice a difference in your personality in general

1355
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:46,360
I mean there is a difference in my personality, but it has nothing to do with weed it has like well

1356
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,360
How would you know that though?

1357
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:55,400
Because there's literally every single aspect of my life and my entire mindset has changed in the last

1358
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:01,440
Okay, but that's that's hardly a scientific experiment though, you know, but also you started doing weed every day

1359
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,720
So to say that I didn't know I think that my

1360
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,840
Personality that I think yeah the changes to my demeanor that have been now. I don't know if this is what I'm trying to put you on trial

1361
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,720
By the way, I'm just I'm just throwing I just want to say it

1362
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,120
I don't I don't know if

1363
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:21,320
Munchies time frame would align with other people's if he feels differently than than others who've expressed similar sentiments

1364
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,640
however

1365
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,560
Before the time where I started smoking like literally every day for the first like four or five months

1366
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,520
I lived here. We were just smoked occasionally like maybe twice a week

1367
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,360
Maybe it got up to like three times a week by the end of the year, you know

1368
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,120
Because she was working a regular job

1369
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,040
I was working doing shit all the time and I would talk about like weed in my videos

1370
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,400
And I would make jokes about it in certain ones and in certain videos

1371
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,840
I would say things like hey, you know, this is a high idea like this is an idea, but right

1372
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:59,360
I had not actually been high and like any videos in that entire period until like a

1373
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Patron-exclusive like podcast release at the end of the year and people would say things like oh digi's so different when he's high

1374
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,160
And I'm like, but I'm not high in any of the videos. I'm telling you about the experiences

1375
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:17,720
I had while I was high. However, my personality is also different because I'm living a totally different lifestyle like I'm not a

1376
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:24,200
Lonely weirdo in his room who feels bad all the time. I'm like, how do we get back to that? How do we get back to that?

1377
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,280
I'm like a guy who's gonna go back to your roots, you know

1378
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,800
Who's like having fun all the time and living well and and like just I

1379
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,440
Just feel very different, you know from the way I did a year ago

1380
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,880
And I think that what people don't understand and also the way I feel about weed is completely changed from that point because back then

1381
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,200
Because we weren't smoking all the time. We did always get real high and we were like goofy and

1382
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,240
Giggly and we'd watch a fucking Miyazaki movie and be like this is the greatest movie of all time

1383
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,080
And then I'd watch a TV anime and be like all TV anime is garbage

1384
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,640
I can't watch any of it like that's what it was like at the time

1385
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:09,400
But I've completely desensitized myself to weed now like I'm high so often that it doesn't really have that much of an effect

1386
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,560
it's more just like something that's fun to do and

1387
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,640
It kind of lets me think a little faster and perceive things better like I've gotten better at following the plot of anime

1388
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,240
I understood Ava way better when I've watched it high. Let me tell you that

1389
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:32,840
Boy, it's just a lot easier for me to parse information because I've historically been terrible at following stories and shows like if you watch my critique

1390
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,560
You'll you'll find that I rarely talk about like specific story elements because I literally don't remember a lot of the times

1391
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,360
I can't even remember the main character's name. I just call him like the protagonist, you know

1392
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,520
Yeah, I've gotten so much better at that just because I can slow down and like really take it all in so I

1393
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:55,760
Prefer to watch anime high because I literally think I get it more and like I can also see things like I can tell the difference between the

1394
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,800
Foreground and background better and I can judge them on different levels and things like that, you know, it's easier to

1395
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,160
Identify each individual element of the production and that's an inarguable

1396
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,320
Like how could I say like no you don't experience this better?

1397
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,520
That's completely fine and valid way of thinking you like how you are better well high

1398
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,640
But I'm saying for the general people

1399
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,760
I don't like like like I don't want to condone or approve of that type of behavior

1400
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,920
Because well, you might feel the same way that Digi does. There are also the many other various different

1401
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,520
Things that I've said that I think are negatives about weed and also I can have my also own

1402
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,600
Inarguable point that I just don't like people who are on weed. You can't say well, no, you just do people like people on weed

1403
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,600
I just I just

1404
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,160
Trying to like

1405
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,880
Quell your argument that you don't like people on weed. That's completely fine

1406
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:55,120
The only reason I'm arguing so strongly is that I'd want to encourage people to smoke weed because I see I

1407
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,640
Think smoking weed will

1408
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:05,100
Can make your life better if you are smart about it and you have someone guiding you and teaching you like how to do it

1409
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,100
Well and to not

1410
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,700
Digi, I don't even really disagree

1411
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,140
It can make your life better if you use it in casual

1412
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:22,740
Intervals if you use it it not every day if you can use it not regularly if you just use it as you know what workers really hard today

1413
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:27,260
I haven't smoked and like, you know a little while. I'll just kick back tonight, you know, tonight's I just want to relax

1414
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:32,500
I can't argue against that. I wouldn't want to argue against that. That's earned, you know, you've put it in work

1415
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,900
You know, you've come home after work. I understand I get it. It's a casual

1416
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:42,860
But what if I'm saying that like yeah, that's okay. If you're someone who's in a life situation where that is best

1417
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:49,820
Yes, that I agree if you're someone who's in a life situation, however, like mine where getting high all the time will help you

1418
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:55,700
Do it all the time and like, you know, use it in the way that's appropriate just like you would any other tool

1419
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,860
That's what they're there for, you know, I

1420
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:04,580
Mean, yeah, I totally agree that like all that there's there's no case that it should like be illegal or anything of that

1421
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:12,700
It's just don't get it. I just I just don't get what it brings. It's never it's never like drugs or alcohol have never like improved

1422
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,200
I've never felt good that I did them afterwards

1423
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,780
Did you hear making his case, you know, that's

1424
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:26,240
Would you consider your regular waking existence to be an utter nightmare. Yes

1425
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:33,060
Proves that all from doing either of those substances temporarily, but I'm saying that afterwards

1426
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:38,980
Like I can temporarily forget about what is my existence that that's actually brilliant

1427
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,940
After you know, sorry bad. Sorry. I was saying but but but afterwards looking back. It's not better

1428
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:49,220
Yeah, I don't feel better because I did it did you do you agree with him what Ben just said

1429
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:54,580
Do you share that sentiment that your life existence is a waking nightmare? Etc. Etc. I would say I

1430
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,900
Would not say that

1431
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,900
however

1432
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:07,060
How would I put this I I think that I have a tendency to get lost in thought

1433
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,900
You know like and if I don't have anything to sort of guide me and focus me

1434
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:21,700
Then I'm not gonna go into a good place, you know, and there's there's multiple ways to go about making sure that doesn't happen

1435
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,700
Interact with somebody that will protect you from thinking, you know

1436
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:32,620
Watch something consume something analyze something create something, you know get absorbed in your creation

1437
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:39,900
Do something basically, it's what I'm saying if you're not doing anything then life is misery. However

1438
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:45,540
Yeah, if you are in a situation like the one that I was in like this is more about

1439
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,820
drinking really for me than than weed because I handled them kind of differently, but when I was a

1440
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:57,460
Before before moving out and all I was drinking all the fucking time you guys remember I've had a historically

1441
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,460
People used to constantly

1442
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,760
Intervention me about how they thought I was drinking too much and I would go no

1443
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,820
It's not like that because if you look up what actual alcoholism is

1444
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,300
It's fucking terrifying and it's nothing like what I do

1445
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:14,940
But but I did drink a fair amount and the reason is that sometimes I would be in a position where there was just nothing

1446
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:21,260
I could do like no one was around for me to hang out with there was nowhere to go because it's too late at night

1447
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:28,140
My sleep schedule is fucked up. I like either don't have a project or I'm stuck on the project and I just was like well

1448
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,820
Nothing's happening. I feel like shit. I don't know how to continue the rest of the night

1449
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,580
Like I don't know what I can change

1450
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:43,100
Other than I can make my mind feel different by consuming this beverage that changes the way my mind feels and I can't predict

1451
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,980
What's gonna come out of that? Maybe it's gonna make me feel even worse

1452
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,940
Maybe it's gonna make me feel better. Maybe I'll feel productive

1453
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,820
Maybe I'll put on the dick show and have three beers. It'll be a great night

1454
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:57,580
You know, I'll rewatch something I love and just imbibe and and and take a step back

1455
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:02,980
And that's why I drank so much at the time. The reason and I smoke so much now

1456
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:09,820
Is more that I am living a an intense existence. I am doing

1457
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,940
Everything all the time. I've got

1458
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,180
Thousands of people who are talking to me all the time and I decided like at the end of last year

1459
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:23,140
I had briefly decided to hole up and just be like no, I'm abandoning discord. I'm abandoning Twitter

1460
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:27,500
I'm closing my comments and then I decided fuck it. I'm gonna go back into battle

1461
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:33,380
And so I opened it all back up and now I'm constantly talking to people. I'm collabing with everybody

1462
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:38,840
I'm paying everyone to do stuff for me. I've got a million things going on. I've got a thousand anime to watch

1463
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,840
I'm you know with somebody all the time

1464
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,760
You know much more physically active than before as a result. So

1465
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:52,680
Yeah, I'm wearing myself out is basically what I'm saying and to keep all that together to hold it all together

1466
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,260
Requires it just constant stream of like mind-altering

1467
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:04,560
Substances that will change the way I feel in a subtle way throughout the course of the day that makes it feel like I

1468
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:09,320
Reset again. I've got energy again. You know, it's like oh, I took I got high again

1469
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,280
Now I can edit the rest of this video. Oh, I drank another beer now

1470
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,280
I can do this and like because

1471
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:21,960
Getting high is like I'm just way more potent effect than drinking is like you can get way higher way faster than you can get drunk

1472
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:28,880
So it's just a really effective way to constantly shake things up and reset your sort of mental clock and you know

1473
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,680
That's why I smoke all the time

1474
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,000
I don't really think it changes the actual products that I create that much

1475
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,880
Because the reason that the stuff I make has changed so much has nothing to do with the weed

1476
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,080
It has to do with just that I started watching lots of really good stuff while I was smoking weed

1477
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:50,400
And I took a lot away from it, you know and decided that I thought my content was just shit

1478
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:56,600
Like my content was something I couldn't watch high because it's boring. So like let's make it interesting, you know

1479
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,800
Well at that right there, you're showing that we is affected what you like how you perceive things

1480
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,960
It's affected watch your it affected how I perceive things is that it made me a

1481
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,840
Elitist who did not want to watch anything bad like all I watched when we started smoking weed like all I could watch was

1482
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,280
Hiyami Izaki and like Jesse's videos and I got I got I had a total ego death watching demos

1483
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,440
Like last three videos that he made that were like astonishingly good and I couldn't believe I'd ever said I was better than him

1484
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,000
You know like but then I watched the rest of his videos and I decided I was better than him

1485
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,200
But like you know those three videos are godly and well, okay, okay?

1486
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:39,360
That was an interesting an interesting thing, but here comes neurotypical Nate to neurotypical explain

1487
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,440
All your bullshit away. So that was very interesting. My Michelle calls me neurotypical Nate's a very

1488
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,760
So it's it's pretty good. She's literally shaming my normal brain

1489
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,320
But that's that's what's interesting about this because the way that you're approaching it is

1490
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,520
PCP fan because like the idea of like calling people

1491
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,680
Neurally atypical is like a meme that I do and oh, yeah, nobody's caught on except I guess her now

1492
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,720
Yeah, she's figuring this shit out. So like we start I started by asking and Ben described the existence as a nightmare

1493
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,760
I mean you didn't quite agree with that, but basically you said that you use, you know drugs use use alcohol use

1494
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,760
You know weed now to like modify your existence

1495
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,400
Which is exactly what drug is for so that you can like achieve the things you want to achieve now that I would never tell anybody

1496
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,920
They can't do that and that's all fine

1497
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,560
But I would say that personally like the hardware and software that I'm running in my body makes me say

1498
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,280
definitively existence isn't is far from a nightmare

1499
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:45,800
I I am at my most happy when I am sober and working on stuff, you know, I don't feel I agree

1500
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,480
I would say that the drug life is the wrong life and this is not how I want to raise my kids

1501
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
Like that's my point. Yeah

1502
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,000
But because I'm not raising kids right now, you know, he's free

1503
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,440
He's not only am I not raising kids

1504
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,160
But like our audience are adults now and they're already fucked like their parents already fucked up

1505
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,640
Like you're listening to the PCP your parents fucked up bad like

1506
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:14,680
Normie life is over. First of all first of all your life is definitely hard because you're trans and everything

1507
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,160
And

1508
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You kind of need this

1509
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,120
Donate to our patron if you're neurotypical

1510
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,680
Do I turn patron if your dad failed you don't take our patron if your dad ran away from home

1511
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:40,120
Don't don't do our patron if you didn't grow up with the father figure. Well, so so this now this is cool

1512
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,160
Like what it comes down to is like if you need okay, like this this would be my ideal scenario

1513
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,200
I don't know if this is realistic. I don't know if this is even possible

1514
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:53,200
But like I was a broken terrible human being when I was young and somewhere along the line

1515
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:58,360
I developed the capacity to work really hard and put in a lot of hours to do things I want

1516
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
I don't know exactly when that came where that came from

1517
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,720
It started sometime after I started doing like t-bap stuff and was able to talk to women

1518
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:13,880
Okay, at some point something changed in me and what I personally would ideally want definitely not realistic

1519
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,880
But I would prefer if people could somehow

1520
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:22,960
Make this change in themselves that simply doesn't rely on a substance to be that way

1521
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,040
And so that they're they're happy all the time and I know that like I take caffeine

1522
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,120
So it's it's kind of hypocritical to say that because I do consume caffeine. It is a drug

1523
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,400
It you know makes me more energetic sometimes when it and it's helpful

1524
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,960
So even I am not like the perfect ideal, but like that that's like my my platonic

1525
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,480
Form like there's a human being who just goes through his life

1526
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,960
And he doesn't need any substances outside of what he wakes up in the morning with he eats right he exercises

1527
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,080
That's why I guess that's why I wish that I could say it was straight edge. I wish that I was yeah

1528
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,280
You know like I think I was a I think if I was a better person

1529
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,280
I wouldn't indulge

1530
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:04,920
It's Jesse we're here he'd be going hard on the loving the straight edge the lifestyle the normal life

1531
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
Jesse we're still with us today

1532
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,640
I mean coping sounds judgmental and I'm not

1533
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,720
I don't know if you can necessarily solve the problem because like doing what Nate does

1534
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,480
Requires constant maintenance. You just have to learn to love that

1535
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,760
Like you have to like you have to feel that your body is like it's worth it

1536
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,960
It's worth the upkeep because it you know makes you feel so good

1537
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:41,960
And by the way like the thing I love doing of like coming home making videos that I devote all my time to like even I didn't like

1538
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:47,920
Work hard to discover that I just I committed to doing some videos with Ben and somewhere along the way

1539
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:54,640
My body just awoke to the fact that it simply enjoyed doing this like I didn't like achieve anything

1540
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,920
I just like my body just enjoys doing this kind of online work

1541
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,800
So I don't even really give myself credit for that. It's just I feel like this is a really

1542
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,400
I'm just so happy about life and everything feels great

1543
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:12,640
That's what everybody said to have that well big part of why like not more people go down this route that you're that you've gone

1544
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,320
Down is that for people who've never really been healthy

1545
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,560
It's difficult to relate to that sentiment of like the idea that you just feel better because like again

1546
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,280
I grew up on like shit food my whole life and yeah

1547
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:32,320
When I like discovered what healthy food was and like that feeling of like cuz I've tried to do the health-kick thing for a while

1548
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
And like yeah, it makes you feel fucking like

1549
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,680
Weirdly amazing like you get a lot of energy

1550
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,080
That's what humans are supposed to feel like. Yeah, what the fuck is this?

1551
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:47,400
Like how is like I didn't know like it's just you don't really understand what food is supposed to be because you've never been fed it before

1552
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,900
It's like how yeah, yeah, but guys I

1553
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:55,460
Know I literally don't eat sugar everyone. I'm going off sugar for I'm throwing in on the trash

1554
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:02,460
No sugar for a fucking week till the next PCP. I'm making a commitment right now. I'm not doing it. Everyone. Let's be healthy

1555
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:07,060
Let's live. Let's truly live everyone. Fuck. Yeah, there's a while there

1556
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:11,420
I've sadly fallen off the wagon and it's really disappointing and you know what day I'm gonna join you

1557
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:15,460
I'm not going to drink any soda or energy drinks. Yes. That's what I'm talking about

1558
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,780
For a while for a while there

1559
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:25,460
I wasn't drinking any soda for like like like from like August up until like like December or something or like around there

1560
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,900
But I remember there's one moment

1561
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:33,780
There's one fucking moment where I was at it was at it was at your house and I think you saw saw this happen

1562
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:39,420
Where we were leaving Wingstop and like there's just some sort of like impulse in my mind

1563
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,220
There was some sort of like weird like like phantom of sodas past and yeah

1564
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,560
I was pouring out my drink and then like I didn't like it was so fast

1565
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,900
I like my body acted on I didn't even cognitively think about it

1566
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,020
I just like got a little like like a tiny sip of

1567
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,700
Orange of orange juice like no

1568
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,060
Chugged it as fast as I could and then I was like, what did I just do?

1569
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,020
What just happened?

1570
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,780
Remember that yeah

1571
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:12,500
Yeah, um, it was you know, it was sad. It was like it was like that episode of the Simpsons where um

1572
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:16,340
Where Homer and Barney get picked for the space program and Barney excels

1573
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,340
He gives up alcohol and he gets really healthy

1574
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:22,420
And then like he he makes it to the end of the program and he's going into space

1575
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:26,820
And then they celebrate with a beer and once a beer his eyes go all crazy and he says oh god

1576
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:33,220
It starts and he goes nuts and he and he runs and he runs out jumps out the window and the scientist says I don't understand it

1577
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:37,900
That was non-alcoholic beer, but it's just the idea. There was a seed in his brain

1578
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:44,060
You know like it wasn't the beer itself, you know, it was the the addiction or the dopamine or the or the I don't know

1579
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,060
The headspace to put him in or something. Yeah

1580
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,140
We gotta fight we gotta fight our weak biology

1581
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:56,940
We have to break our body man is both the sculptor and the sculpture every change will will will wreak agony upon your whole body

1582
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:03,140
But that's how you make yourself into a better human being and a more perfect form. You have to carve yourself everybody

1583
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,860
That's a well that's a well-known old adage

1584
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:12,500
Yeah, there was a guy coming down the alleyway and he was a skinhead Yobo sort of lad

1585
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:18,500
He looked at me and he smirked and he said do you want some weed and I looked down on my feet

1586
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,700
And I looked in like glancing his eyes. I looked away and said no

1587
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:26,940
Thank you and then he scoffed and they walked away and I felt bad. I felt emasculated

1588
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,980
And that's that's my weed story everybody. Is that true?

1589
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,220
Yeah, oh cool

1590
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,820
I was in an alleyway and a guy was gonna offer me weed and he was a young man

1591
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:42,460
He looked like he was bigger than me and he was a fucking freak and and and I had my stupid hair

1592
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:46,940
And I was like, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I would trust no, thank you, sir. You know, yeah

1593
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:50,620
Yeah, I don't want my weed from an alley. Yeah, I trust alley

1594
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,820
OOP

1595
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:58,140
Get give give what's alley OOP stance on the weed

1596
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,380
She doesn't have a mouth so it doesn't really

1597
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,820
So she's injecting

1598
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,860
That's why she's white

1599
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:16,060
She's just bleached pale from all the bleach. She's injected into your hands. You inject cocaine, right? Yes

1600
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,860
Okay, where are we going with this? Are we?

1601
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:23,060
I just want to I want to give my yeah, I'll give my big my last thing

1602
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,060
I want to say word because Nate your lifestyle

1603
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,500
Your lifestyle of healthiness like I really look up to it and I want to capture it

1604
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:35,340
Like I want to be that guy not necessarily the beans shit, but like

1605
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,460
The thing is my dad is somebody who in

1606
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,020
When I was like a kid and he was in like his early 30s

1607
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:51,100
He got real fat and like he was balding and he just kind of looked like shit for a little while

1608
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,540
And he had been like a real handsome dude like he if you look at him pictures of him. He was young

1609
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:02,740
He was fucking beautiful. He looked like Tom Cruise and like he he got fat and old as you do and then he like

1610
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:08,060
Fucking was like this is bullshit. Like I'm not gonna be like this anymore. So like at age 35

1611
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:09,340
He got like

1612
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:16,540
Unbelievably shredded like he looked amazing. He was like, you know fucking bench pressing over 300 pounds and shit at age

1613
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,380
35, you know, and like I don't know what it is

1614
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:26,460
But there's something about the like 30s to 40s range where guys just seem to develop the will it's because your body

1615
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,460
Starts giving out. That's why that's yeah because yeah

1616
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,980
I know it's coming because the reason my dad every single time my dad's quit something

1617
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:39,340
It's because he was told he had to like he used to drink real bad and as a result of drinking

1618
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:45,780
He would smoke and he literally be developed an allergy to alcohol and couldn't drink anymore because it would give him like really bad

1619
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:50,500
Anxiety attacks. So like but now that he quit like he's healthier than he was before

1620
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:55,980
He quit smoking now. He's a vegan and it's like you you have time you always have a chance

1621
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:02,500
You just but you you got to know that you can do it because if you let yourself get used to being like a fucking fat ass

1622
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,900
And you just never learn how to fucking be healthy

1623
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,820
You're not gonna be able to suddenly save yourself at age 40

1624
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:14,100
But like you got develop that discipline the way I see it my my current plan is like just we're about to move to Boston

1625
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:19,100
I'm gonna spend the next three years like slimming. I'm gonna lose like 30 pounds and just keep it off

1626
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:25,900
I'm not gonna stop doing any drugs or anything like that. Then I'm gonna have kids then I'm gonna probably stop doing drugs learn Japanese

1627
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:33,840
After we've established PCP HQ and it's like taken off then I'm gonna go establish the Japan branch of PCP PCP

1628
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:40,420
The Boston branch and I'll go to the Japanese yeah, that sounds great

1629
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:46,940
Yeah, this is my 10-year plan and once I'm in Japan because of the fact that you don't like drive anywhere

1630
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:51,660
You just run. I'll just fucking run everywhere. You just run. Everyone in Japan is sprinting

1631
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,620
Oh, we know now they're doing the devil man dash. Yeah

1632
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,540
Like bullet trains are actually on Flintstones technology, sir

1633
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:16,140
You have just like run with yeah, like like there's there's really fast actually since since devil man crybaby came out

1634
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:20,900
There's been a massive stratification in society between the narrator runners and the devil man dashers

1635
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:26,300
It's pretty massive racial and social tension right now. Do you guys know about the Brazilian Naruto run?

1636
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:30,580
No, okay. There's a national event in Brazil

1637
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:37,580
We're like 40,000 people fill the streets and Naruto run for like miles be ours. What the hell are they doing down there?

1638
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:42,820
It's real and there's YouTube videos of it. So show credible get that shit. That's not even a good way to run

1639
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,180
Yes come to Brazil

1640
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:58,420
Okay, my final word to the will of the deceased is this

1641
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:06,840
There are other ways to feel good. There are other ways to have that dopamine rush and I because I'm me

1642
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:13,860
Value hard work. I value social connection. I value going outside. I value taking up a hobby

1643
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,340
I value learning an instrument

1644
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:21,220
I value things like that as opposed to doing nothing and sitting on your ass a smoking weed in your bedroom

1645
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,220
And I value productive

1646
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:28,900
you know aspects of society and that's the kind of people who I want to surround myself by because that's what I respect and

1647
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,700
That's what I admire

1648
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:36,380
So I don't want to be your friend if you're a stoner who wastes all of your money on weed and then just sits on you know

1649
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:39,980
His ass I watching you know anime or you know fucking playing video game

1650
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,620
I don't care about that. I don't care about any of that shit

1651
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:49,860
I want to be around people who I like people who I like aren't so this is like completely side-side like this is just like the

1652
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:53,180
The arguments that I can argue. I can't argue

1653
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:58,540
I just don't like being around stoners because I don't like the way they smell or like the stereotype of a stoner

1654
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:03,580
Which is real and I've encountered them. I don't like and I think they're annoying. I can't really argue that I can't argue

1655
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:08,820
Dopamine rush incentives reward, whatever the fuck. I'm sure yeah. Well, you can make your case

1656
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:13,220
I agree with that stance. I think you you should definitely not get shallow rewards

1657
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:18,980
Chase the big I'd say because there's more rules say anybody who likes dark souls. You already fucking know

1658
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:23,420
You already know approach your life like dark souls. It'll be just a satisfying

1659
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,820
That's the best thing I've ever heard

1660
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,300
Here's here's my okay. I've got I've got a life rule to go by for this

1661
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:37,100
So I of course I feel a lot of empathy for the guys that like did you mentioned about like like if you live in like a fucking ghetto

1662
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:41,900
There's nothing going like you don't know about you can't work on your entrepreneurial internet YouTube career or whatever

1663
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,140
You've got nothing going on. I that's just an example

1664
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:45,940
It's just an example

1665
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:51,820
And it like it if you've got if you if your life is hell and the weed is your one escape and it is I get it

1666
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:56,620
No matter what no matter who you are then then I get then who the fuck am I to criticize how you do

1667
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,300
But I would always say have a have your goals in mind

1668
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:05,460
You know, maybe your life is complete hell and there's no chance that I'm like well fair enough get high every single day

1669
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,300
I mean, what do you gotta do? But I don't believe that's the case for almost everyone

1670
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:15,740
So try to work on a plan to get yourself where you want to be I think most people just don't have like any

1671
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,940
Ambitions they don't they need to be reminded that they can achieve something with their life

1672
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:25,980
Ambitions, but they should yeah, I look for it. Yeah. Yeah

1673
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:31,420
Well a a a lot of people don't have ambitions, but they should but be a lot of people don't like

1674
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,500
Understand that they can achieve things

1675
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:41,220
Mm-hmm, you know like I didn't feel like I could achieve anything until maybe a couple years ago sure

1676
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:46,300
I'm sure like everyone is like that's the only reason to become an adult. Yeah, but my mind

1677
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,100
What are you gonna do like how?

1678
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:54,500
Well, I don't know. I don't know. I will I will I will say that what I believe that stuff

1679
01:29:54,500 --> 01:30:01,740
That's all do that I I will give people a vision of a better future for themselves by not being just a stoner and nothing else

1680
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:05,260
I'd like I think that's sincere fucking you can make something yourself

1681
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:10,700
You can you can achieve you can achieve great things if you put your mind to it like anyone can I believe it

1682
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:14,100
And if you use weed just to relax every once in a while and you're still a productive guy

1683
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,780
Then what the fuck just do whatever the fuck you want man. Like who cares it's fine. It's yeah

1684
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,620
More power to you. I just think that like like

1685
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:28,580
This is one of those things where it's like the act unit of self. I don't like but you could say well, you know

1686
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,740
It's not that bad, you know, you know, he's just he's just having fun on the couch

1687
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:38,300
You know, whatever the hell but I think this this happens a lot where doing an action is

1688
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:43,540
Like indicative of the kind of person you are and your morals and beliefs

1689
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:49,620
We're sure I feel like you have to be a certain type of person to even want to become a stoner

1690
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,020
Who does weed all the time and just sits on the couch? I think you

1691
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:57,780
Things about you. I think yeah about you if that's the way that you use the drug

1692
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:03,620
Like if you are that type of stoner and yet you're a fucking like you deserve the stereotype because

1693
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:10,300
Like it is a bad thing to be, you know, you know, I just just to go way back a little bit

1694
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:19,100
When I find casually the last time that I did weed I was visiting friends in around Seattle in Redmond, Washington and

1695
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,500
Like we did weed it was fine

1696
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:28,380
Like there's a guy who's a big weed guy and like what what happened to me was that I just we were watching Tim and Eric and

1697
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:31,900
It was an episode I had seen many times and just this time

1698
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:36,540
I found it a thousand times funnier than I ever had before and don't get me wrong

1699
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,460
That was an enjoyable experience except I became very self-conscious

1700
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:47,660
About how it wasn't as funny to everyone else as it was to me and that to me was embarrassing because I have this

1701
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:54,500
That feel like you get embarrassed that you're enjoying yourself and you know that it's because of the weed and it's like oh no

1702
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,860
This is so uncomfortable

1703
01:31:55,860 --> 01:32:02,940
Like I want to observe the world as closely to objectively as possible because that's just like the way you can make a

1704
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:07,180
Change and sculpt the world you want, but you know what that's just a fun story. That's fine

1705
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:10,820
I it wasn't a crazy thing wasn't a big deal, but here's a life rule everybody

1706
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:14,220
This is my this is Nate's hot tip for drug use

1707
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:21,780
Never be the biggest stoner in your friend group. That's my life tip and if you follow that one simple rule

1708
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:27,100
I think yeah things will go. I mean that would just lead you to going into groups with bigger stoners

1709
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,700
Oh, no, it's gonna start an arms race. It's a big stoner and a small bitch

1710
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:37,620
I like to think that it'll it'll just make everybody move away. Alright, I want to get us into a to the questions now

1711
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,620
Let's do it. Let's do it. Oh, yeah

1712
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,620
Okay, shoot shoot shoot. I get

1713
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:50,260
More high from taking a chunky bite out of a soft white like spongy

1714
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:55,700
crusty bread, okay, then I do in any amount of alcohol

1715
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,780
Use yeast for bread not beer

1716
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:10,460
Hashtag save the yeast everybody. Okay question one is from Mozilla fennec and zero who asks

1717
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:16,420
Do you have to prepare yourself to record a script or a podcast in any way? Yeah, dude. I got a smoke a huge

1718
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:28,500
Bubbly bubbly bubbly ball. I have to turn off my real self. There it is any podcast

1719
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:33,740
You have never seen me as my real self and unless we're in person

1720
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:41,380
Even I don't I don't generally like write scripts or take notes about things but like

1721
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,880
I don't know if it counts as prep

1722
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:49,420
But the times that I've recorded like a rant like a rant video or like a you know like a ramble video

1723
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:52,060
I will yeah, I don't like prep for it

1724
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:56,260
So I mean or maybe a little bit but mostly I just I start recording and then I'll just stop

1725
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:59,020
I'll just redo it a bunch of times like until I'm sure

1726
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,160
Yeah, yeah

1727
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:07,240
In the show notes, you will find my my notes for this very podcast you listen to right now. Oh

1728
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,960
Nice nice check that out

1729
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,680
I I used to prepare notes for the PCP, but I've just found that I'm just so good

1730
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,920
I don't need to that's that's my real thoughts on the matter though for like every other video

1731
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:27,600
I I don't think they meant like notes wise like just prepare yourself to record a script or podcasted

1732
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,920
Yeah, more like you know what I get in the mood

1733
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,440
You know what I do. Yeah, this is the thing I always do

1734
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:38,960
I never drink like milk or orange juice or anything like that before a podcast because it fucks up your throat

1735
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:45,540
You gotta be able to the only good thing drink water tea. Yeah tea is good water water doesn't help me water makes me like

1736
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:51,240
Some reason doesn't work. He does though. I don't know. Maybe it's just because it's warm, but that helps

1737
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:59,040
Yeah, that helps I've actually meditated on this a little bit cuz for a long time. I I was thinking I was meditating on the issue

1738
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:02,080
Why am I better on arm shield than I am on the PCP?

1739
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:08,360
Why am I more likeable on arm shield than I am on the PCP and on and all of the many reasons I've come back with this as

1740
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,160
Well, it's later in the day

1741
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,440
It's like at night we record like at night

1742
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:17,360
And so if I had more times like go throughout the day and you'll get all my groggy the sound get on my drowsiness out

1743
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,360
And I've been able to like you know, you know

1744
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,200
Get a whole bunch of water and by get hydrated and shit

1745
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,880
I've been able to you know get some energy and I've been able to expend that on the podcast as opposed to the PCP where I woke up

1746
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,860
Before just like like an hour for the podcast and I still feel like I want to die

1747
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:40,120
It's interesting you say that because I think the opposite is true for me of the PCP that part of why I'm able to have so much

1748
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:46,720
On arm retrieval what no I'm just saying that like I just meant that like the opposite is true for me in terms of

1749
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:54,040
What time of day is more convenient to record a podcast because like if I record the PCP relatively early

1750
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,640
It's like I haven't had the time to exhaust all my ideas yet today

1751
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,000
So I'm like excited to talk because that's what I like doing is talking

1752
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,360
Yeah, and by the end of the day like sometimes when I do the pub crawl because it's at 11 p.m

1753
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:11,200
On Mondays and almost always by that point on Monday

1754
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:16,720
I've already made a bunch of shit and like talked about most of the things I had to say or I have to do another like

1755
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,040
I'm about to do a patreon podcast after it or something like that

1756
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:25,600
So I don't want to say too much because then I have to have more to say on that it's just like as the day wears on

1757
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:32,520
You know each new podcast it's gonna be more exhausted because I've already been talking all day because even if I don't record anything

1758
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,040
I was definitely talking all day, you know

1759
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,160
Fair enough I got I got nothing else to say on that

1760
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,700

1775
01:37:55,480 --> 01:38:00,480
I see main character girl standing in the Gainax pose. What is this implying?

1776
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:06,960
What does this mean and maybe that maybe they'll fucking have a Gainax reference in there or something?

1777
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,420
I mean, I know it was in the goddamn TV show, so

1778
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:16,260
Okay, sorry, I just saw that and it was weird. So okay moving on moving I would like to see that is what I'm

1788
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:03,820
Here's a quiz a question. Okay, like Cappy from the patron lounge

1789
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:08,660
What is your favorite thing on the internet? This is very much like like what is a recent internet going on?

1790
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:10,660
I believe they're saying oh

1791
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:17,740
What is really there's an okay? Yeah, go ahead. There is a podcast came out by my hero and idol

1792
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:24,620
Yon Renkowski aka 91. It's called radio pro seconds on whiz dumb gun

1793
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:29,100
I'll look in the description obviously and it is an absolute experience

1794
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:36,260
I've fallen in love with yon all over again his wit and humor and just on the fly like rants and promos

1795
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:43,020
That he cuts just just on like like stoners and like juggalos and cyber vermin are just an utter fucking treat

1796
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:48,180
And I'm so happy. I was really worried. This is gonna be like. Hello. It's me yon renkowski

1797
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,380
I made a thing in the past and now I'm a wash-up internet creator

1798
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:55,380
This is my life and I'm just going to sell to you Brit landly because I have a podcast show

1799
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,220
That's what everyone does now, right? But no yon is not he is

1800
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:07,380
Ceaseless and it's advancement in performance artistry. He has so many weird fucking unique gimmets like in the first episode

1801
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:12,580
He he has like he sets up an interview with a crisis actor

1802
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:18,100
Who who like like was one of the people who acted on the set of the Syrian Civil War?

1803
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:22,420
What interviews him about about how the series war was staged wait

1804
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:29,060
The whole thing it's fucking incredible. Yeah, it got damn radio Prozac absolutely incredible

1805
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:34,820
I love it dearly and it just reminds me how much Barry Collin to be and it's really inspires me to be a better person

1806
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:38,740
That's fantastic. Oh also. What was the question that inspired that answer?

1807
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:41,820
Uh, it was what is your favorite thing on the internet at this very moment?

1808
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:49,800
Okay, I have an answer. Yeah shoot. Um, it's the fucking it's the fucking rowdy fuckers juvenile detention

1809
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:57,080
The slime economy should be coming online today or tomorrow. Yeah, the slime economy will be live

1810
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:02,720
We have been workshopping it. We have been I we I watched I watched the economy crash and burn

1811
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:08,000
I watched slime credits worth fall to zero as people lost faith in their society

1812
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,040
They had to be replaced with a new with a new currency, but we are we're yes

1813
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:16,160
It's it lives the world lives munchie

1814
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,120
It's a living breathing place

1815
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:25,000
How's it feel to be a whole four mega slimes behind me at this point? What the hell is going on?

1816
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,680
What happened to the cop killers? It's embarrassed. Yeah, the the shit the cop killers were on top of their game

1817
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:36,600
But then like the rowdies have just the rowdies have just have just embraced bots and just basic

1818
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,880
Cowards. Yeah, well, there's no rule

1819
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,440
You can easily kill a body could easily kill one, but the

1820
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:52,160
The fucking killers were just so lazy and incompetent that they just couldn't foresee what the rise we're doing the cop killers

1821
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:56,280
Look the cop killers don't employ cowardly tactics, but I tell you what they do employ

1822
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,400
massive economic stratagems and when

1823
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:08,800
They do and who else what was was like the first real bot then B dash Evan the fucking notorious killer

1824
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,880
So don't give me that shit you fucking cock. I'll kill you. I'll kill you

1825
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,940
You're done off to the combat zone right now first

1826
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:23,520
I'm gonna kill you and then I'm gonna I'm gonna suicide and then I'm gonna go kill the Lord of Ghosts just to make a point

1827
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,440
I kill them once and I can kill them again

1828
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:32,120
I'll tell you I this is a small thing my favorite thing on the internet at this very moment

1829
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:37,280
Legibly the first thing that comes to mind is the gaming Brits new video on the new God of War

1830
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:41,680
I liked it a lot way to go chas you're killing it. That's it. That's my whole answer

1831
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,080
It was good also in case you're not aware he like has a history like

1832
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:52,240
Action games are like his wheelhouse and he made a video that was real famous of the first like the trailer for this

1833
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:57,960
And I've both had famous videos about the trailer of God of War that's that said almost the same thing

1834
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:02,080
But his was like a proper video and mine was me doing the Gilbert Godfrey depression for half an hour

1835
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:09,160
The game in Britain is making me feel bad about like how good his content is and I got a

1836
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:14,240
Right away does he like the game or not because I've been hearing it's actually great

1837
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,640
The summary of spoiling your video chat. Sorry about that

1838
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,840
But like every it's been a week by the time it's been out now

1839
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,680
He just says that like

1840
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:24,600
Everyone's like been telling him and commenting on his video like you were wrong

1841
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,400
The video is getting 10 of 10s across the board every journalist loves it

1842
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:32,920
Meanwhile, his point was journalists will love this game excessively

1843
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:37,480
So like he's just like yeah, like of course it's getting 10 of 10s from these journalists

1844
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,520
The game is exactly as not great as I as I feared it would be and it's boring and like yeah

1845
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,520
It's not it's not it's not the DMC that he would wish you know it to be or whatever

1846
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,840
So, of course. Yep. It's what it's basically what he predicted. You killed it boy. You killed it

1847
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,960
Well, um, I've my favorite thing to come out recently was fucking mania madness

1848
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:01,640
From our good friend endless Jess who fucking covered. Yeah, that was great

1849
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:06,920
And it was like it he ended up turning it into unintentionally this like epic

1850
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:15,840
Fucking weekend spanning event just like mania itself because I guess he recorded like a five-hour podcast and released it in 30 minute

1851
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,120
Chunks that he was releasing over the course of days. I love that. I loved it

1852
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,200
It was so good. I think I should check it out

1853
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:27,280
It should watch the whole thing start to finish like I'll tell you because back in the day

1854
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:33,240
Jesse had the drowning and kayfabe channel and that's how I got in any interest in wrestling at all was I would listen to these hours

1855
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:39,180
long wrestling podcast and even though it was just like Jesse on a couch in front of a camera and like

1856
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,640
rambling like you know

1857
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:46,840
Like constantly undercutting himself and stopping to talk about how he has no idea he's talked about and stuff like that

1858
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,680
You know that was like the first true rambling vlog

1859
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:57,960
I ever enjoyed where I was like wow like he's just such a good storyteller that I don't even care that this is just a guy sitting

1860
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:02,560
On a couch like rambling at me because this is fucking fascinating stuff

1861
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,200
And I want to hear about it. So now he's doing it again

1862
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:10,760
And I haven't cared about wrestling in the last year and a half because he hasn't been able to fucking talk about it

1863
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,280
So I haven't heard anything about it

1864
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:21,480
Learned all the new stories. It's like three hours of fucking it feels like watching a TV show because it's 30 minute chunks and like

1865
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,360
If you watch them over the course of days

1866
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:27,840
It's like you're slowly marathoning through this epic series that has like this amazing

1867
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:33,280
Climax to it and everything all these huge moments because it's like the most exciting WrestleMania of all time and

1868
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,080
He cut out like it's highly edited instead of being him in front of a camera

1869
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:43,800
There's like it's just like images on screen like a long time, but like the audio is highly edited

1870
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,800
I mean to let you know

1871
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:50,680
It gives you exactly what you need and like in order to understand if you would watch this WrestleMania

1872
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:57,680
Like you would need someone like Jesse there explaining everything happening. Yeah, why yeah, so just having it presented this way

1873
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:01,760
For for guys like us. I think is like the best way to do it. Oh, yeah

1874
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,760
Like literally watching everything you just watching the good part of wrestling

1875
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,320
Exactly all you gotta do is then just go watch a YouTube video of the actual fight

1876
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:14,280
So you can see the moves and like I mean he puts half of them on screen

1877
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:17,720
I didn't even feel like I had to watch any of this shit. I was just like, yeah, there you go

1878
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:23,560
I got the whole WrestleMania experience and it was way better than it would have been if I'd actually watched WrestleMania

1879
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:26,560
So yeah, yeah, I had a really great time with that series

1880
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,440
Sincerely hope it continues to be a yearly tradition from and you know

1881
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,840
So do I and every basically every year

1882
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,320
I think we missed one like two years ago

1883
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:40,920
But the PCP boys will gather when Jesse sends us a link to watch the Royal Rumble and it's one of my favorite

1884
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:46,000
We did it like a month or two ago and it's one of my favorite things to do. Yeah, you weren't there tragically

1885
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,680
But I think me Jesse and Gib were all hanging out

1886
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:53,000
Munchy to munchy, that's right. It was a great time. It's a great time

1887
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,600
Yeah, wait, I've actually got I've got one

1888
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:04,000
I want to know what hippo and Ben think are the the best thing that's out right now. Oh, yeah. Yeah, wait

1889
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,840
I did I thought I said it was it's the rowdy fuckers juvenile detention

1890
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,200
Well, hippo, what do you think is the best thing out. I mean, I like stuff. I

1891
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:17,920
Don't love stuff though. I don't know whether I have like a like

1892
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,520
Dude like it like if I was I had an older brother that I was gonna run and try and show him how cool

1893
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,600
I am for knowing this well, I mean there's this I can't think of there's this one character

1894
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,040
I really like that you might have heard about the Lord of Ghosts who's really being interesting to me online right now

1895
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:35,280
I really like seeing what's going on with that guy really interesting

1896
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:45,720
Yes, I honestly though like the stream you guys did of the ratty fuckers cop killer stuff like doing the lore contest and stuff

1897
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:52,120
That was like I loved that. Yeah, I watched basically the whole thing and I the lore is rich and deep

1898
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:59,080
And if you only you guys monetized it better, I would actually think it was a cool thing to spend your time on if only if only

1899
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,920
I want to go the fuck do we do that?

1900
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:07,400
I don't know before I find out it's $1 per slide before I even shut up about the the mania madness thing

1901
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:11,480
I also have to mention that like since Jesse's come back. He always writes these

1902
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:20,320
unbelievably long patreon posts for his videos that are literally a second video often with more context than the video that you

1903
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,640
Watched so also those have been a great fun to read

1904
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:30,800
It's like I just read them out loud to to May and that's like it's like I'm just getting another video out of it

1905
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:36,840
Basically, well, that's cool dope. Oh wait. I have thing I have thing that I am in I'm doing currently

1906
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:42,880
I asked for anime recommendations. Yeah, and she won it because I heard munchies say he wanted anime recommendations

1907
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,840
I was like, you know what? I should get an anime recommend

1908
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,400
I went to Twitter and did you said something you said Gundam?

1909
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,680
I suggested Gundam goddamn it. That was me. No, he he said. Oh, I don't know

1910
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:58,520
I said it first that people I know I told him to watch double 80 it's just because it was sure

1911
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,920
Oh in the pocket and I've been watching it like one episode a day

1912
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:07,000
Which is like a really good way to watch something like that and it feels like it's it's great

1913
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,360
It's like a movie that's like gots. It's like a it's a good like action

1914
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:17,120
Compared to like a BBC show just like a six episode tight compact drama, you know

1915
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:24,400
Yeah, you're watching anime. It's it's it's it's an anime that does not feel like an anime. Oh, thank God

1916
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,000
Thank God

1917
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,880
Hippo, are you gonna try and become an anime boy too because that's what I'm well

1918
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,840
I'm trying to become an anime boy, but I'm definitely trying to watch more anime. That's a definitely direction

1919
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
We have to go back

1920
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,640
I'm trying to be like like an anime boy before anime became anime

1921
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,800
Yeah, like the 90s and the old all the old stuff. That's kind of like

1922
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,880
Like a very very heavily influenced by actually good things

1923
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:53,880
Like all the not the incestuous slurry of anime as it exists today, of course

1924
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,680
Yeah, like if I see a picture of like a modern anime, I'm like, well that does just

1925
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,680
I

1926
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:07,360
Anybody who hasn't seen a Gundam double 80 war in the pocket by the way anime fans get out get on it

1927
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,880
It's it's a it's a I consider it the best access point to Gundam simply because that's what I'm looking for

1928
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,320
It's only six episodes

1929
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:19,800
It's mostly standalone like there's a little bit of dialogue in the first episode that might go over your head if you don't know

1930
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,440
The show but like the story but it doesn't matter. It's inconsequential to the it's yeah

1931
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:30,160
I've been engrossed the characters are really well done in in terms of like having like quirks that I'm like

1932
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:35,800
Ah, yeah, I could imagine him doing that as like as I just want to say human being my personal consultant

1933
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:43,000
Ukrainian Zagok or however, it's pronounced. Yes, please at me on Twitter telling me if that assessment of this anime is correct

1934
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,960
Cuz I trust you more than anyone when it comes to anime for some reason. Tell me if this stuff is good

1935
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,640
He doesn't seem to have patrician taste this guy knows

1936
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:01,000
This entirely on his avatar, I'm just gonna tell you that if somebody told me they thought Gundam double 80 was not good

1937
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,080
I would not trust anything they said after that. Okay

1938
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:14,320
We should have a podcast where we watch anime together that we want to know called the week of the plebe and the plebe

1939
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,840
Yeah, let's actually do that

1940
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:24,560
Hey, hey, listen to that me too. Yo, uh, here's an axle leader

1941
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,200
That's a pretty good show pretty good show. That is 50 episodes long just let me know

1942
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,360
Yeah, it is it is ooh, but stop after 25. I'll just watch all 50 at once

1943
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:39,080
Also, the manga is better. So if you want to read the manga instead, there's also that option the ending

1944
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,960
It looks really good. I'm like all anime which looks really bad

1945
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,360
Basically, okay. Hey, there's a question here from

1946
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,200
This is a Twitter question

1947
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:52,440
Directors done looks just as good, but you know, we can get into that another day

1948
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:57,680
Yeah, that's what I when you when you guys reach the stage where you want to get woke just come to me and I'll

1949
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,880
I'll give you the dark side of the moon is what I'll give you

1950
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:08,680
Digi literally what should happen is you should write like like it should be the plebe the plebe and the weeb

1951
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,800
Yeah, me and hippo get into like an entry-level anime and then we're like this is not a bad idea

1952
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,800
I like it and did you like

1953
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,960
That actually happened recently like what I did like I can't get over that we brought that up last show, right?

1954
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:33,920
I mean the Japs are real sympathetic to the fucking to the fucking croutes, you know, but whatever

1955
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,120
Yeah, that should happen

1956
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:42,760
Listen listen to this question here. This is from at at not you who three

1957
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:48,680
It's weird. Okay. Here's the thing. Are you aware of the reach of your lectures?

1958
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:53,800
I have presented two of them for my students to teach how to do lectures

1959
01:52:54,360 --> 01:53:00,160
Regardless of the subjects. Well, also that munchie one so spicy. That's a little common. Which one?

1960
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,480
Um, well the new one of course the new one. I have a I have a I have a story

1961
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:09,240
I got I'm retweeting. I'm replying to this guy right now asking which one so maybe he'll get back to us

1962
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,120
I actually okay, so I have been

1963
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:18,640
Recognized in public like relatively a lot recently like really yeah

1964
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,640
I was hanging out with econ and

1965
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:25,520
We went to this a magic we went to like a magic night and a guy there knew me

1966
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,560
But that's not that surprising because he knew econ

1967
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,400
Okay, but like he wasn't expecting to see me or anything

1968
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:35,800
But then the other day we had a party me and Jackie had a party at our house and like a guy was just there

1969
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:40,120
I might have even run into him before and he just at some point in the night asked me like hey

1970
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:44,640
You're Ben, right? I was like yeah, I was like Ben St. And I and then he could see in my fucking

1971
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:50,460
Sonichu lecture pulls out his little patreon subscription. I mean that's like a million fucking views right like yeah

1972
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:55,760
Like half a million. Yeah, that's fucking nice. That's a lot of views. Every single day that I wake up

1973
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:59,480
remembering that it would have been St. Patron it feels me with such glee

1974
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:05,520
Such malicious glee and how I'm ruining the world for my fellow man. I love it

1975
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:12,800
It fills it fills me with glee too, man. Also. I finished I finished signing the books. They're shipping probably

1976
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,240
Yeah, but but in regards to this question people like

1977
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:25,320
Disproportionately tell me how much they love I mean with when it comes to my content people say they love the gurren login videos

1978
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,760
Like the galco video which was just like successful in terms of numbers

1979
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:33,680
But then the the one that's even more discussed than that is the Kingdom Hearts lecture

1980
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:37,560
Got a lot of buzz and people just are like, yeah, dude. That's like your best like it's incredible

1981
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,380
The the lecture formula is such an overwhelming success

1982
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:45,640
Yeah, and I got on the dick show again because I made a lecture, you know, I'm right

1983
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:52,560
I mean if I hadn't even ever been on there before I probably could have got not like I I knew as soon as I made it

1984
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,960
That I was like this will get me on that show like

1985
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:02,400
And I by the way, it was my idea just throwing that out. Yeah, that's true

1986
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:10,880
That passion and raw like like knowledge. Yeah, and you're like otherworldly like like if you have a lot if you're doing a lecture

1987
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:17,560
That's something you care deeply about and you have a lot to say. Yeah, so it's you just dumping your best shit in the entire world

1988
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:21,280
Which is why does anybody want to hype like any lectures?

1989
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:26,360
They have planned because like we've never announced any I think before like way ahead of time

1990
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,560
That's like the guilty gear one

1991
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,640
But I think the guilty gear one got like hype by being mentioned beforehand and I that one did for sure

1992
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:39,600
I'm gonna go ahead and say this mine because I want to encourage everybody to go listen to this music in the meantime

1993
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,960
So that it'll be extra rewarding when I explain it

1994
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:46,600
I want to do a lecture on the entire lore of the first five Coheed and Cambria albums

1995
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:52,480
So that's a good one if you want to go listen to Coheed and get into their music and maybe learn a little bit about the lore

1996
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,920
Before I fucking open it up and make you realize how fucking insane it is

1997
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,440
Yeah, there you go

1998
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:04,240
Well, I I mean I still want to hype I want to hype tails gets trolled. That's coming out real soon. Oh, yeah

1999
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,560
It's almost done. It's almost but the time you hear this. Maybe it'll be out

2000
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:11,160
It might be out by the time this is out. Maybe mm-hmm

2001
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,360
Other than that, I don't know what else I want to do like lecture

2002
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:16,680
I really wanted to do a lecture on the Digi clips

2003
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:23,600
But when I went to go and like look up the that's the thing where where the people thought that the Digimon world was becoming real

2004
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:26,240
Right, but when I went and I looked into it

2005
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,960
Could not like find

2006
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:35,280
Like I just could not find like the info that I remembered reading about it before so I couldn't confirm any of the stuff

2007
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,720
I remembered about it, you know, I bet you should you should spend some deep dive time

2008
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:44,520
Try to see if you can pull that up because hey anything that means like you've told me much about that like it's

2009
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,800
I remember so much, but like when I went to go find it. I was like, where did it all go?

2010
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:57,040
There was so much there was it's it's got it might be somewhere it might be buried in like a something awful thread somewhere is my best guess

2011
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,040
I just hope it still exists like I pray. Yeah

2012
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:08,040
And if you can if you can capture it in lecture form it'll exist for all time so that would be great just for historical

2013
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,720
For me to do would be home stuck and I do do that, but I feel like yawn

2014
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:19,060
Chief was already there. I don't need you that but I just came with us just now

2015
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:24,080
Hmm. I like like what I like to do about lectures is stuff that is like influenced me and like you know

2016
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:28,600
Wasn't my childhood and that like stuck with me and like it like made me feel a certain way or yeah

2017
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:34,360
I'm part of my mythos human history lecture until nation. Obviously, so what I could do is like an explain

2018
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:38,760
Like tf2 because you have to like like not like the yeah

2019
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:44,720
Like like like the meta lore of tf2 it's descent into fucking retardation

2020
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:51,080
And how was the greatest game of all time? That's uh, maybe that's a pretty good idea

2021
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:57,440
It's interesting because I because I have like almost like three thousand hours. Are there like human characters you can mention in this

2022
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,160
Okay, good. Yeah, yeah, gay banool

2023
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:08,540
Yo, I actually I have literally already put together a list of future lecture ideas with with various degrees of

2024
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:11,880
Their viability and how much research needs to be done for each one

2025
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:17,440
I I'm not gonna share any specific ones right now because I really like to keep things secret before I release them

2026
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:23,600
But what I will say is that people have put a lot of suggestions in like the Kingdom Hearts and the like the new final fantasy one

2027
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,040
Which is doing very well. Thanks. Everybody go watch that

2028
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:31,880
And and I'll just say that I have been taking note of the suggestions Metal Gear Solid

2029
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,520
That that that's one that has been suggested that is true

2030
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:41,560
That was that was just a guess that actually yeah, that wouldn't people suggest that went a bunch

2031
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:50,120
Historically, but yep, you know, just just more will come in the future at some point everybody. So stay tuned for the radcon four. I

2032
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:55,240
Want to try one radcon four literally with literally no

2033
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,040
I want I want to try one

2034
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:01,400
But the the things I have are like massive undertakings

2035
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:07,440
Yeah, one of them is like an entire medium and I'm not sure whether I should follow an artist in the medium or like describe the

2036
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:12,960
Oh shit, what about like here's just a thought like the history of the ps1 just like start to finish

2037
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,720
Well, I don't know that that much. Oh, okay. That's just like I wrote over the ps2. I mean sure

2038
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:21,080
It's just I don't know like I don't know what to do

2039
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:26,640
You got to take some time and really think about like I think like for me the most fun is when it's something that's like

2040
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,800
That no one else would have thought about it all like yeah

2041
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:36,160
All the lectures have kind of been like like you wouldn't even imagine somebody would do this except for maybe

2042
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,760
Well, even something like a final

2043
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,720
Fancy would have made a no writer video about then it's not interesting. I mean that's definitely true

2044
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,600
But like what makes in my mind the final fantasy and the Kingdom Hearts lectures so

2045
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:56,480
Like like actually good is the fact that like very few people actually know all the details and all these learning about final fantasy, too

2046
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,560
Hey, I don't know if you know this but like literally

2047
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:06,480
Right after radcon may and I played through I played the final fantasy 10 and she played the final fantasy 2

2048
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:11,160
And she really I know yeah, just she played through to just on the basis of me

2049
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,600
Describing to her what you had described to me that night

2050
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,240
Yeah

2051
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:21,760
Emperor and she beat the whole game. I beat 10 finally the first final fantasy game

2052
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,600

2055
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,960

2068
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:04,360
We also don't answer it, but it was what would you rather have a 20 inch thick two inch long cock?

2069
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:06,360
No, no, sorry. It's a 10 to 10 inch

2070
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,000
Who would choose the 10 inch wide cock

2071
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,400
Not good. All right. It's not even penis at that point. Oh, I gotta give this guy credit. Fuck. Where was it?
