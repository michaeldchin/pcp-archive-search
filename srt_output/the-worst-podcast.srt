1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Sword art online doesn't even make sense. I mean, it's online, yeah, but there's sword

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,080
art. Like, I always thought it was when I saw the dojins of sword art online, I thought,

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:23,960
uh, how do you fuck a sword? Like, why did the people draw sword art? And obviously it's

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:34,720
online, it's on dojinmoe.com. Like, what, what, why do you call it online? Why do you,

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,520
and it's art, yeah, but the sword, I don't get it, and I didn't get it. And then I heard

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,280
that there was an anime called Sword Art Online. I was like, oh, it's inspired by the, it's,

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,160
it's characters from the anime called Sword Art Online. And I just kept thinking, like,

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,880
what a stupid name for a thing to be sword art online. I mean, what could it be about?

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,480
Could it be about an artist? Oh, wait. Oh, sword art, like the art of sword swinging.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Couldn't you call it like blade fucking guy, blade nigger two, blade nigger attacks them,

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:26,640
you know? I mean, he wears black. Uh, welcome to the first in a 48 Pot series on why sword

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:40,480
art online sucks. Oh, here's pot one, the everything. Pot one, the everything, everything

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,400
sucks. There's a guy, and there's a girl, and there's a boy, and there's a girl, and there's

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:55,120
a woman, and there's a boy, and there's a guy, and then they're all homosexuals. Nothing

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:05,200
wrong with homosexuals, but I hate them. Oh, here's a lot of, a lot of, a lot of all

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:14,000
that stuff and sword art online. And it will fetch me my tin crumpets, just me, just me,

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,360
just think of it as, I just love a tin crumpet, swine me with a polka.

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,680
That's enough tin crumpets, and back to the review. Part two, sword art online.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
It's not good.

20
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Part three. No. No more. This ends now. I've never seen sword art online. I've never seen

21
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,120
Attack on Titan. I've never seen Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I always thought Full

22
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
Metal Panic was part of that series, and I got confused. I'm like, which do I watch first,

23
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,720
Full Metal Alchemist or Full Metal Panic? I hate things that have things that aren't numbered,

24
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,040
but it wasn't even part of the same fucking show. I mean, people, you act like you're supposed to be

25
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,640
liking anime? Well, it's hard, okay? It's all confusing. It's dumb, and I don't get it. I mean,

26
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,160
Crunchyroll doesn't even work. I go there, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, typing in fucking,

27
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,520
I don't know what I'm looking for. How do you get into new things? How do you get to a point

28
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,280
in your life where you're looking at new anime? What are you fucking gay? Just stick with what

29
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,560
you know. I watched so much Naruto, and then Naruto Shippepa do it in, and fucking it was all

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,840
right, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything else. And I wonder why that is. You know, you're

31
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,720
seeing a new thing, you're like, you know, when you're a little boy, and you're on anime,

32
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:53,200
anime stream, I don't fucking know, anime, lovelyanimateplace.com, and you see the top ones,

33
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,480
you see Naruto, you see One Piece and Bleach, and you're like, oh, people at school talk about

34
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,920
Naruto and Bleach, and you watch him. The asshole, but you don't realize that it's fun,

35
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,480
but you do it because you want to fit in. Like, I remember one guy saying, do you even know Naruto?

36
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,600
Like, I was pretending I did, because I'm one of those, you know, I just one of those moments

37
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,840
where you just say something, and he said, do you even know Naruto? Do you know Shikomaru?

38
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,840
And I'm like, uh, do you even know Zabusa? I'm like, do you even know Itachi?

39
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. I don't know that dude. I guess I don't know it at all. And then

40
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,360
they killed me. They stuffed me in a bunch of trash, a bunch of rubbish, a carcass.

41
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Yes. I was. What a carcass I was as they rolled me down the hill in a trash bin.

42
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,520
And I thought to myself, well, I really need to impress those guys. So I watched Naruto.

43
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:18,000
I want a rocks. Many rocks. What does he want to do with them? I want a rocks.

44
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,280
My Japanese man. What does he want to do with the rocks? I want a rocks.

45
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,000
You want to rock or you want to rocks? Oh, many rocks.

46
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, the way.

47
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
You may realize that this is stupid and it's deliberately so.

48
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
See if I see it deliberate, then it's okay.

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,240
I, I don't appreciate your time and which is why I'm spending it doing nothing.

50
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,840
This is going on the procrastinators channel. It's a podcast now. It's suddenly now a podcast.

51
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,320
The Gibbon show where nothing is quite right. Now that I'm doing a show, it's time to fill the air.

52
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
I need to fill my lungs with air.

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,040
Delicious air. Doesn't it feel great to just take a big whiff of air, even though you don't need it?

54
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,520
It sounds funny too. It sounds funny.

55
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,280
Hey, let's, let's look at my DS. Let's do an impromptu game review of whatever I have on my DS.

56
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,120
Oh, it's Pokemon moon. All right. Here's a sneak peek of my game of the year video.

57
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,880
In fact, this is my game of the year video. I'm going to slip this bit out of,

58
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm going to put this bit out of this video and put it into my video because I don't, I don't like,

59
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
I don't like you. All right. I wrote down some notes from Pokemon moon. Let's go to the mind of

60
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:19,520
my notes. Oh, where is it? Oh yeah. Pokemon moon. Pokemon moon is fine. The main point I have,

61
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,360
it's a, it says good for a Pokemon game, which means it has the staples. Cool Pokemon, uncool

62
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,760
Pokemon, battling, catching, bad guy gang, roots, towns, poker centers, boring characters and towns,

63
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,920
people, status effects, Zubat and others. But it's slightly better than the normal staples

64
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,440
because they have interesting characters. They got the edgelord and a goofy troop of loopy dukes

65
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,280
and their loopy king and the insane woman who I can imagine is actually very scary to young

66
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,040
children. So that's good. You know, it's always nice to know that children are scared. Then there's

67
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,640
the punching bag and the professor who's not a nerd and the girl and popcorn. And that's it.

68
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:20,800
That's my Pokemon moon review. You know, if I had a beer bottle, I would jangle it just to make,

69
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,600
give you the illusion that I was drinking, but I don't have a beer bottle. I do have these things

70
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,280
or cards I keep dropping on the table. That's what the cards were. That's what that was. I'm not

71
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,840
even starting to begin to make like a good video podcast, but you're still here, I guess. Hey,

72
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,920
you ever know these sunglasses that I have? Here's what they sound like.

73
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,400
They're sunglasses. They're very plasticky. They're very, very plasticky.

74
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
That's it. That's my sunglasses ASMR section of the video. Now we've got to have a,

75
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,360
we've got to have, oh, look, listen to this, listen to this shit. All right. In my hand is a special

76
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,520
button. It is a button that will tell me and you that we are a badass and it will give us confidence.

77
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,440
And this is a real thing and I'm about to press it. Here we go. Do what you love.

78
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Do what we love. All right. What else do you want? What else wisdoms do you have?

79
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
You create your reality.

80
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,120
All right. Feed fear, a sucket, sandwich, sandwich.

81
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
You are a badass.

82
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,360
I've never been so insulted in all my life. I know my mom didn't give this to me

83
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,960
because she thinks I'm insecure. She just had it. I mean, she says that, but she's given me

84
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,520
like self-help books before because she thinks I'm still as depressed as I was when I was 17,

85
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,680
which isn't true. How fucking patronizing can you fucking be?

86
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,560
It's unbelievable. Zero, zero out of 10 on product. It came, hang on, it came with,

87
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,400
it came with this book. You are a badass mini book and it's not a joke. This is,

88
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,400
oh my God. I was about to say this is as sincere and patronizing as it can possibly be.

89
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:36,960
The guy who wrote it is called Jen Sincero. S-I-N-C-E-R-O. Jen Sincero. Okay. Maybe it is a joke.

90
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,760
How could it be not a joke? Jen Sincero. I'm assuming you're reading this that there,

91
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600
because you're reading this, there are some areas of your life that aren't looking so great

92
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,880
and that you know you could be doing looking a whole lot better. This book is about getting

93
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,000
mighty clear about what makes you happy and what makes you feel the most alive and then creating

94
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,800
it instead of pretending you can't have it or that you don't deserve it or that you're a greedy

95
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,320
ego, maniacal fathead for wanting more than you already have. I guess it is a joke. I mean,

96
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:17,440
maybe it's like, I assumed that it was like talking like, oh, we're a self-help book and we're,

97
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
you know, you're not that bad, you're great, you know, but, and it is saying that it's the whole

98
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,160
book about, like, number one, appreciate how special you are. Number two, drown yourself in

99
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,600
affirmations. Number three, ditch the self-deprecating humor that this is the sort of stuff. Oh, let the

100
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,480
love in. Oh, forgive yourself. Don't compare yourself to others. I guess, no, this is very

101
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,120
sincere. Love yourself. It's a sincere self-help you book by written by someone with a bit of

102
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,440
self-awareness, but not enough. Like that they can say, stop calling yourself an ego maniacal fathead

103
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:05,280
because you're beautiful. I'm so mad at how fucking stupid this is. Do what you love. No,

104
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,760
well, I will, but shut up. I don't want to do it because you told me to, you fucking idiot.

105
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
You create your reality. You create your reality. What does it say?

106
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:27,920
Feed fear a sucket sandwich. A sucket sandwich, sandwich. Fuck it. Oh, oh, unacceptable.

107
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
That was terrible. Sorry for that. Sorry for that. Lemon. I can't do lemon.

108
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,640
How to tap into the motherload, the G word. Hang on, what? Wherever you happen to stand on the

109
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,520
God issue. Let me just say that this whole improving your life thing is going to be a lot easier if

110
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,640
you have an open mind about it. Call it whatever you want. God, God ass, the big guy, the universe,

111
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:03,440
source energy, higher power, the grand poo bar, gut, intuition, spirit, the force, the zone,

112
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,280
the force fuck off, the zone, the Lord, the vortex, the motherload. It doesn't matter. Whatever

113
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,000
you choose to call it is important. What is important is that you start to develop an

114
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,080
awareness of and a relationship with the source energy that's surrounding you and with you and

115
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,240
with you and you. We enjoy the same engine. We should give you the best pale air if you give it

116
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,640
a chance because you think all of us are connected to the limit of this power and some of us aren't

117
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,840
being a fucking, a fucking, a fucking, a fucking hippies. Oh, meditation 101, basic meditation

118
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Fuck you. You make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like an actual retard,

119
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:58,000
retard. Oh, love yourself. Surrender for people who, this is like a training guide for fucking

120
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,600
sheltered social justice warrior people. Like, I'm reading this one thing. It just,

121
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,240
it just gives me that idea that people who turn to this weird way of thinking are usually very

122
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,800
self-conscious. Surround yourself with people who think the way you want to think.

123
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,680
That's a, that's a thing they say. You've got to surround yourself with like-minded people.

124
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Obviously makes sense in theory, but like, you go too far with it and you're in a fucking hug

125
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,520
box. You're in a, you're in an echo chamber. You're thinking about a lot of the same, oh,

126
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm sorry I'm going on about this. It's just, I don't feel any reason to keep this stupid

127
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:52,240
You are a badass button. So, and this book, so I'm reading it now just to get it out of my life.

128
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,440
I don't ever want to return to it. Number five, love yourself. You deserve it. I really am,

129
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,480
I think it's got to be a joke. Really, what it is, is that I press this thinking,

130
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,320
it's going to be like, whoa, cool dude, you're a badass, guitars and explosions, you know,

131
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,600
something cringy, but something like, something harmlessly cringy, like, dude, whoa, radical,

132
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:30,320
you're cool. Yeah, bro, but it's just this sort of sounding American lady saying sincere and very

133
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,680
patronizing bullshit. How to get over your BS already. Procrastination and perfection.

134
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,200
Procrastination is one of the most popular forms of self-sabotage because it's really easy. I mean,

135
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,160
I get it, I agree, but I hate that you are saying it. I fucking hate you. I want you to die.

136
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,960
Blah blah blah. Because it's not like I don't know how to stop procrastinating, it's that

137
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,920
knowing it is not half the battle, knowing it is like one percent of the battle.

138
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,000
Doing it is the hardest part and it's the entire part.

139
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,360
How to kick some ass.

140
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:31,280
I really want to burn this book. It's worth it. It annoys me just like,

141
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,040
what annoys me the most is that the idea that somebody would buy this for somebody

142
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,360
and somebody would actually have a use for it, like they would, they would press the button

143
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,440
and feel better. Like that is the saddest thing I could possibly imagine.

144
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,520
Like if you need that in your life to get through, like I can imagine someone on the

145
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,440
brink of suicide and there's someone like, oh he's depressed, I should get him this and he presses it

146
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:13,920
once and he just, like it's just, I would commit suicide after hearing that.

147
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,320
After hearing this button being pressed, I would just crumple in a heap and like, oh it's not worth

148
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:34,800
it anymore. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

149
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,280
That was my OC dog. I don't know, he's a furry. He's gay, he's a gay furry.

150
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:54,080
So when it comes to like podcasts and stuff, usually I have a topic and a theme and or a

151
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,920
topic and a theme and like a thing of consciousness, a stream of consciousness,

152
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,760
which is what this is, this is a stream of consciousness and it doesn't have any guests

153
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
and this is a one-time podcast. It will never happen again ever. I will never make another

154
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:16,960
podcast because I have integrity. I don't want anyone to know that I did this,

155
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,560
which is why I'm putting on the internet for the cheap laugh and a cock in my buttock.

156
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,080
Just one though. I'm just looking at things on my desk that seem like, what can I fucking

157
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,760
talk about? I've got a camera over here, I've got a camera over there, I've got a fucking

158
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,120
piece of paper. Oh boy, let's talk about a piece of paper. You know, guys, we've got a piece of

159
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,480
paper here, let's hear it. That's not a piece of paper, that's a pad of paper. Yeah, you thought

160
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,960
you were just listening to a piece of paper? You've got a whole pad, pad of paper here.

161
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,560
It's a bunch of sticky notes. And that's that. I don't stick them anywhere, I just write on them.

162
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,440
Sheesh. Are you still here, you idiot? You dumb idiot?

163
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
I can't believe you even, even in the background. Like, why would you put this on in the background?

164
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
You'd be like, ha ha, Gibbs talking, lol, hippos being a silly boy.

165
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,320
And then you think it's buffering because like, I had silence. Because you're not looking at it,

166
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,520
you're like, oh, what happened? What was he saying? Did something happen? No, I just tricked you.

167
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
You're fucking, I got you.

168
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,040
I mean, part of me thinks, oh, this is awful, I'll never put this up, but part of

169
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,960
me loves it, part of me loves how terrible it is. Hey, look, we've got a magic eight ball.

170
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Magic eight ball is something I associate with Risker, but also with Toy Story,

171
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,960
because it's the thing that Woody shakes and he's like, I fucking hate Buzz Lightyear and he says,

172
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:14,080
yeah, you do, or something. And it's like integral to the to the fucking buzz getting knocked out of

173
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,000
the room. And it's what a weird scene that is. Like, I always thought that it was really unnerving

174
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,200
because of it's a sunset, but it's like really harsh lighting in dark areas. And

175
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,160
and it's not really, it's not really clear what time of day, like, it's not really clear what

176
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,520
everyone's thinking. Like everyone's sort of like they're sleeping their toys. It's weird. It's a weird,

177
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,080
like the very end of a sunset sort of lighting, but it's darker than that. And it's all about Woody

178
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,840
conspiring with the with with hatching a plan to get Buzz fucking lost.

179
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,960
What a great movie. You know, I don't I don't care what people say about like dated CG.

180
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:09,520
Because like CG, I like old CG games. You know, it's only dated in the

181
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,440
that they try to make realistic humans. And you can obviously make realistic humans a lot better now.

182
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,840
But the toys, they all look perfect. Because they're toys. I mean, that's probably part of the

183
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,280
reason why they made it in 3D. Like, oh, we can't we got this new technology. But how the fuck do

184
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,680
we make a whole bunch of characters? It's going to be a nightmare. It's like, I don't worry,

185
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,280
just make them toys, just make it so that you don't have to animate their body parts moving

186
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:43,920
and breathing and all that shit. And it's like, perfect. We got it. Toy Story is great. What do

187
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:53,120
I mean? Shrek. Shrek's a good movie. Shrek 2 is one of the greatest 3D animated movies.

188
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,640
If you don't believe me, do you think it's just a meme? We'll just remember the Billy Maze was a

189
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,360
meme and he was fucking amazing. Michael Rosen's a meme and everyone loves Michael Rosen. He's

190
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,480
actually a very good children's entertainer. People make fun of what they like. You know,

191
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,480
you don't see many YouTube poops with Pootie Pie in it. Maybe a couple to ride the thing,

192
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,600
ride the train of hype when he was like beginning to be a thing that people would search for.

193
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:34,320
Shrek's good. I don't know about the B movie. The B movie doesn't look good, but maybe it is.

194
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,120
Shrek's good. I mean, the third one was, you didn't need to make the third one and the fourth one

195
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,240
was kind of like, come on, you've done it. You've finished. Actually, the ending of the third one

196
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,400
is pretty cool, but like, I think the second one is really the peak. First one's pretty great.

197
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Second one, the best. Kung Fu Panda as well. Kung Fu Panda movies, I don't know. Nate, for some

198
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,160
reasons, seems to think that Dreamworks is all shit. And I don't know why. I guess he just like,

199
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,840
he just had that opinion from some experience and he's not willing to give any other Dreamworks

200
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,520
movie the time of day, like Madagascar 1. It's all right. You know, I don't know whether it's great,

201
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:32,000
but they're all great children's movies at least. But like, Kung Fu Panda 1 and 3, I haven't seen 2,

202
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,600
I should, because I've seen the ending of 2 and it looked great. But 1 and 3, they're really good

203
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,640
movies. Like, such action. You know, I like Kung Fu Panda 3 more than The Force Awakens.

204
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Don't know what that says about me. I went, I went to see both of them in the theaters,

205
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,160
which is why I make that comparison. Because I don't go to see things in the theaters ever.

206
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,520
Like, this year, I don't think I went to see anything. What movies came out?

207
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,360
Obviously, I haven't gone very recently. No, I haven't seen a single movie this year.

208
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,440
Not one. Not a single movie that came out this year I have seen this year. That's one of the

209
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,280
things I've noticed. Like, people are making of the year, of the year lists of things like movies

210
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:31,440
and albums and stuff. And I'm like, I'm just rediscovering or rather discovering

211
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,560
stuff from when I was a kid, because that's what I like. I don't like new things.

212
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,840
Not that I don't like new things, but like, new things often are uninteresting.

213
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,040
Like games. Like, modern games. This is like a thing that people have said for a long time now,

214
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,920
but it still holds true for me. Like, modern games do not interest me at all. If it's big

215
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,960
budget, then it means it's a big no-no. On principle. Not on principle, actually, but

216
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
well, yeah, on principle. If it costs a lot to buy and it has a lot of DLC and it's one of those

217
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,160
pre-autobonus bullshit things, I will never purchase it. I will pirate it if I want to,

218
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,480
but I will never purchase it if it has all that bullshit. If it's just a game that comes out,

219
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,440
like The Witcher. I think I bought The Witcher 2 because I heard that it was a great game made by

220
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:33,120
great company. And if my computer could run it without exploding, then I would have played it, but

221
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,200
I don't purchase things that are bullshit. And so much of modern games is bullshit,

222
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,120
and so much of the console scene is, like, gone. Like, all my favorite characters have been

223
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,760
discontinued and replaced with white, boring people. That's right. That's right, I went there,

224
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,000
they're white. You ever thought why Uncharted sucks? Because it's not a black woman

225
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,520
with a dick and and three genders that change depending on what hour you're playing the game.

226
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,800
And it also changes the dialogue. Ooh, that's interesting. That's interesting. That's a stupid

227
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,400
way to make an interesting mechanic that changes about stuff. Depending on what time of day you're

228
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,080
playing the game, stuff is different. That's a cool concept. Too bad, no one cares.

229
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:36,160
But yeah, like Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Spyro, Crash, they sort of died before the end

230
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:44,240
of the PS2 era, but like, you know, these characters, these colorful cartoon characters,

231
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,720
they just got fucked in the butt. Ratchet and Clank continued for a bit,

232
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,320
but Tools of Destruction was not interesting because it ended on a cliffhanger and it

233
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,640
suffered from what I like to call, fuck you, syndrome, where it's like

234
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,400
the first three Ratchet and Clank games, the first one was made and it was a complete game.

235
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,080
That was it. You played it, that was the Ratchet and Clank one. The sequel, same shit. You know,

236
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
even though they probably knew they were going to make Ratchet and Clank 3, they made Ratchet and

237
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,000
Clank 2 and it was completely, perfectly its own thing. You could play one or two, you didn't have

238
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,640
to play both. And then you got Ratchet and Clank 3, which is the same sort of thing. It

239
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,440
borrows elements from one and two, but you can play it on its own. It is, from start to finish,

240
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,840
a complete thing. Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction, the first game on the PS3,

241
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,080
was a cliffhanger ending game, which means it wasn't a complete thing, which means they were

242
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,440
planning to make another three games. And obviously, once you plan to make another three

243
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,880
of anything, the certain parts of, like, each individual thing becomes less, like the Hobbit

244
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,680
movies, you know, if they just thought, let's make the Hobbit movie. I mean, when you're making,

245
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,760
like, Lord of the Rings, each one is a whole book, fair enough. The book has a beginning and an ending,

246
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,040
but it will continue, but it's not like ending on a cliffhanger that's unsatisfying. So each film,

247
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,680
similarly, does not end unsatisfyingly. Everything that happened in the book is satisfying that it

248
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,880
completes itself, but it could still continue. The way the Ratchet and Clank did it was like the way

249
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,840
that they did it in the Star Wars prequels, or the Hobbit. The Hobbit, not so bad, but it's pretty

250
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,000
bad. Like, they had the dragon at the end of the second movie, but it didn't actually really happen

251
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,560
until the third movie. You've got to see him die at the, just the beginning of the third movie.

252
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,280
And it's all, it's marketing. It's not actually a film that feels complete in itself. It feels like

253
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,960
you have to watch all three at once, or at least the second and third at once. And it's just dumb.

254
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,440
And the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, did I say the Star Wars? I just said the prequel trilogy.

255
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,880
The Star Wars prequel trilogy was like the first movie was like introducing Anakin. The second movie

256
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,160
was nothing at all. And then the third movie was like the actual important part. Like, they had

257
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:26,560
three movies and like 13% of all three movies put together was actually a movie that was important

258
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,440
or interesting at all. And it's like you,

259
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,840
they're not satisfying for a very, a lot of reasons, but like the element that I find,

260
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,120
and I'm referencing here is that they don't feel complete in and of themselves. Maybe the first

261
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,240
one does. I'm not, I'm not sure about that. I can't really remember. Like, they do kind of like,

262
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,120
at the end is like, yeah, the droids are dead. Hooray. It feels like the end of a new hope.

263
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,360
It could continue, but right now they won. The second movie is like,

264
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,680
the point I'm getting at is that Ratchet and Clank died to me because the first PlayStation 3 game

265
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,400
was a cliffhanger that was completely unsatisfying. And I didn't like the characters or the story

266
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,640
that much. And I didn't like the extra mini content to do that much. And I was like, why the fuck

267
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,720
would I buy the next games if this one wasn't good? And so I never did. I never bought the PS3

268
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,680
trilogy of Ratchet and Clank. And I'm sure a lot of other people felt the same, which is why the

269
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:42,240
Ratchet and Clank is not the main thing. You know, if Insomniac had come up with a better idea than

270
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:50,560
the fucking glowy blue red asshole infamous guy that, you know, that they would actually have

271
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:58,080
a game series to talk about to make the next gen thing. Like, if infamous was not crap and boring

272
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,760
and disgustingly shit and blue and red, then they might have stopped making Ratchet and Clank and

273
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:14,080
made their own thing, like Naughty Dog Dig with Uncharted, which is all right. I don't like it

274
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,680
more than Jack and Daxter, obviously, but I don't begrudge it too much. It's okay.

275
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,200
You know, I feel sometimes I feel like I should play all of them. I have them.

276
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:38,160
It's like the PlayStation 2 thing, like everything that was cool about it, all the

277
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:46,720
cool series that started and ended. And then the PlayStation 3 comes out with my favorite game

278
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,360
companies coming up with boring shit that I didn't care about at all. It just, you know,

279
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,800
there was no equivalence of my favorite games like Okami and Dark Cloud.

280
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,560
And I will say Dark Souls is probably like the best thing to come out on that sort of

281
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,760
Demon Souls on the PS3, but then Dark Souls was on the PC and I obviously would go there instead.

282
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,960
Bloodborne I have on PS4, but Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 are on PC and I have them on there.

283
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,920
But like modern games aside from Dark Souls are boring and I don't like them ever.

284
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,040
I just don't like them. Every single time a thing comes up,

285
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,720
it's like whatever. Final Fantasy, I was never into it. You know, that's another thing. That's

286
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,320
unrelated to modern games being shit. It's just like fan things coming back like Ghostbusters,

287
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:55,600
never saw it. Final Fantasy, never played it. You know, remakes and I pressed the space bar

288
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,880
and I stopped recording. Reboots and remakes and stuff. There's just an ocarina of time on the

289
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,400
3DS or Majora's Mask on 3DS or like anything. Any big thing that has come back in like a fan way

290
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:17,440
and people like making a big hubbub about it. That's never happened for anything that I like ever.

291
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,080
I can't, I cannot recall a time where something has been remade or rebooted that I was into

292
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,960
aside from maybe Ratchet and Clank, which was a tie into a movie, but it was sort of,

293
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,760
there was no fanfare around it. Nobody really cares. I think that's just the thing. Like I'm in

294
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,640
that generation that was a little after all the classics like Mario and Zelda and Metroid,

295
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,880
Nintendo things, and then, you know, the PS1 games like Spyro and Crash Bandicoot and Conkers

296
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,000
Bad Fur Day and Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and Diddy Kong Racing and all those, you know,

297
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,720
ocarina of time. Everything that all the kids in the 90s were talking about, that's all coming back

298
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,240
now and the stuff that I'm into has yet to come back and it will eventually and all the people my

299
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:14,160
age, my generation who care about PS2 rather than PS1, they're all just not interested in anything

300
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,520
because there's nothing that's appealing to them. And it's a shame because it's like anything new

301
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,400
that's coming out has so much fanfare about it. You think about like a new game comes out and then

302
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,880
instantly there's porn of it. There's porn of it everywhere. You can just find every character

303
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,440
in every situation possible. Porn everywhere. Everywhere you go. Anywhere you want. Any character.

304
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
Pokemon Moon, like five seconds after it's released, there's porn of every character in the

305
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,880
whole game. Undertale, porn of everyone all the time. That's how I judge like the fan content

306
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,040
because I don't care about really anything else. But like when you think of like PS2 games,

307
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm not sure whether I would look at Ratchet and Clank porn actually, but supposing I did,

308
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,600
there's not a lot of it. I don't think I've looked, but there probably isn't a lot. I have

309
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:13,600
looked at Carmelita Fox. There's a bit of that because she's a furry. But there's not a lot of

310
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:21,440
it. Like it's in that time where before it came out, before artists were making fan content of

311
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:31,600
that about stuff. So it's before the internet really was becoming big. But it's too late after

312
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:38,320
the classics because every time anybody wants a big, making a big art piece, they're like, oh,

313
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,840
I'll draw fucking Samus. And everyone knows Samus not only just because of Metroid, but also because

314
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:51,040
of Smash Brothers and stuff like that. Like you draw a character that was really old and has continued

315
00:36:51,040 --> 00:37:00,560
to be there. Or you draw art of characters that were, you know, just, just before, you know,

316
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,680
Super Mario 64 stuff, fan content of that. Like there's mods of all that stuff. There's like crazy

317
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,680
modding communities. You all know Pan and Koic, right? Those guys, him and his buddies, I don't

318
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:22,560
really know what they're called again, the ABC crew. It just feels like, it feels like it's,

319
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,920
it's unfortunate because like there's old stuff and then there's new stuff and then there's the

320
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:34,240
stuff I'm into and it's all ignored by the internet in general. And I am mad about it to a certain

321
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,040
degree. I don't really care too much about seeing porn of my games that I like. I only brought that

322
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:46,240
up because I was thinking of Kamalita. All right? You know, some furry porn's all right.

323
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,960
It's just tits with fur on it. You just forget the fur is there. They didn't really draw it furry

324
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,000
anyway. They just draw it colored. It's like there's a boob and it looks like a normal person's boob,

325
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,200
but it's orange. Okay. It's a rabbit boob or a fox boob. They don't have a tail, but they otherwise

326
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,360
are human. What am I saying? You create your reality. I sure do. Idiot.

327
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I just went on rants about things.

328
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh, the podcast never ends and it will always remain directionless. It's the sort of thing

329
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,240
you would put on in the background, but you need to listen if you're trying to figure out

330
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:48,080
what I'm doing, saying and such. Since I'm in a dour mood, let's talk about a dour topic. Videos.

331
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:01,040
I don't want to. I don't want to do it. Videos suck. They're okay.

332
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,440
But, you know, they suck.

333
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,400
I'm making a game of the year. What the date is today? The 28th? All right. Well, I can't do it.

334
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:31,760
It's the end of the 28th. I've got to record me talking about Pokemon Moon and Dark Souls 3.

335
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,920
I've already talked about Pokemon Go. Those are the games of the game of the year.

336
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,080
I want to talk about all three of them in a game of the year video.

337
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,160
And I got to do it all at 29th and the 30th and the 31st. I'm glad there's a 31st.

338
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,000
Maybe I can do it, but, you know, and I don't want you to just say, oh, you can do it. Shut up.

339
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,480
That's also patronizing. It's like coming out to a wheelchair guy and saying,

340
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
don't worry. I still think you can walk.

341
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,400
There's nothing like that.

342
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,480
I know I can do it. You idiot. It's not like I really, really love you to say,

343
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,320
you, I feel sympathy for you.

344
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,680
If you're having trouble trying to do something, then whatever.

345
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,840
Everyone is. I think it's a bit redundant to say, oh, you know what, dude? I know how you're feeling.

346
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,320
I got stuff I want to do and I'm trying to do it and it's not working out so well.

347
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,920
But you know what? You just got to keep doing it and that's what you got to do.

348
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,280
And I'm like, I get it. I know. Thanks. Thanks for trying to help, but you're really boring.

349
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,800
You're really normal. You're really just wasting time.

350
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,720
You know, the amount of time you spend trying to cheer others up could be better spent being a cool guy,

351
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,320
making your own things and then using that to entertain them, just like what I'm doing.

352
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,960
You know? I mean, sure, if you made a podcast about complete bullshit, nobody would listen to it

353
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,400
if you didn't have a fan base already like I do. I'm not saying make a stupid podcast.

354
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:36,160
What I am saying is I'm an asshole who's telling you to not give me good feelings because...

355
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,880
Suck it, my dick.

356
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,800
I put two slices of bread in between my penis. Wait, no, how do you do that?

357
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,080
You two put your penis in between your slices of bread and then the magic happens.

358
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,440
Welcome to the close-up. Welcome to the close-up part of the show where I'm really close and I'm saying

359
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Radio Shade, over and over.

360
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,000
Shit.

361
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,920
This isn't a decompression chamber more than it is an exhaustion tube. I was really

362
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,120
so tired that I couldn't move and I made a podcast right now.

363
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:14,640
Talking into a mic has helped me stay awake but now I'm tired again. Whoops, I should have just

364
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,640
started talking about bullshit, then got into an excited state and then used that to work on

365
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,080
something but instead I tried to make a podcast that kept going and going and here it is keeping

366
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,200
on going and now I'm tired again and I can't do it.

367
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,320
Let's see what's going on in the discord chat.

368
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,360
Mage is there talking about Sword Art Online. What are you doing?

369
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:56,640
You are a badass.

370
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:05,920
I can't even do a sentence.

371
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:25,200
I can't even do a sentence.

372
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:35,440
There's anything to have been gained from this. It's that you wasted your time but more importantly

373
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:47,200
that you wasted it with me and I idiot.

374
00:44:47,200 --> 00:45:12,480
I just want to play video games, dude.
