1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
I want to bless that guy. You're a son of a bitch.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:19,580
Imprive practice exercises. Start with a little SCREAM start with a little scream, yeah yeah

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,940
Just to get loosened up.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,780
Ah!

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,260
Ah!

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,300
I can't scream.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,140
Ah!

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,460
Yee!

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,740
I was trying.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,740
I think last night, I stayed up.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,100
I stayed up all night.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,900
But so last, yesterday afternoon,

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,940
I was trying to like squeal.

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,060
I was trying to make it the most high-pitched sound I could.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,180
And I'm getting afraid that like my range might be,

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,620
I might be too old and my range might be decreasing.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,060
My vocal cords might not be what they used to be.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,900
Let me try.

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,740
Oh, no.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,340
Eeeeee!

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,700
That's actually, you know what?

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,540
Excellent.

23
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,780
That's pretty high.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,580
It got to a point where Discord couldn't tell

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,900
that it was a person speaking and it cut you off.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Really?

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,940
You know what?

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,100
I think maybe it was just like late at night

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,820
and I was just like tired or something.

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,660
Nah, baby.

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,900
These pipes, these pipes are as good as they ever been.

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,740
I can do a really high-pitched squeak,

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,980
but I don't know if I'll be able to do it on command.

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,700
But I got to do it now that I've mentioned it.

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,940
What if I started shooting bullets at your feet

36
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,900
and make you dance?

37
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,060
Could you do it then?

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,060
I don't know why it cracked me up so much.

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,020
I did it.

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,780
The mic probably didn't pick it up.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,300
I literally could not even hear it at all.

42
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
It sounded like a fucking dentist drill.

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,860
It was actually bad.

44
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,940
I don't like it.

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,660
Discord could not recognize that you were making any noise.

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,540
Well, I made a squeak.

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,380
I believe you.

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Viewers at home, I'm sorry.

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,700
It was very high-pitched.

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,260
Speaking of dentist drill,

51
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,060
I still haven't been to the dentist for years.

52
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,420
I should probably go.

53
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,420
What stage are you on the big book of British smiles?

54
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,860
Do you remember that Simpsons bit?

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,020
There are, oh yeah, yeah, I remember that bit.

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,220
I, there are a couple of spots on my teeth

57
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,220
that I think probably need a veneer or something.

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,860
I'm hoping I don't need any like crowns

59
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,180
or like root canals or anything like that.

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,580
I'm hoping I don't get it.

61
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,740
There is a sensitive spot.

62
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,780
It's not on my tooth.

63
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,420
It's like, I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it.

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,860
There's a one spot between the two of my teeth

65
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,220
on the left side of my mouth

66
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,620
and I can feel it sometimes and it doesn't hurt.

67
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,460
It just feels a little weird, a little sensitive

68
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,500
and sometimes it bleeds a little bit.

69
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
So that's bad.

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,620
But I mean, it's not like tooth pain.

71
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,580
So I don't know if like they have to drill it or anything.

72
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,380
I don't know.

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,420
You have to bite a bullet, literal.

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
One of these days, one of these damn, damn old days.

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,260
Speaking of ruining your teeth,

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,180
I tried a different gummy thing.

77
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,980
Okay, okay, I looked up a recipe.

78
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,220
I looked up the ingredients for orange slices.

79
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,140
You know the candy, orange slices?

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,980
I think so.

81
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,220
We might have a different name for them.

82
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,140
They're like chocolate orange.

83
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,340
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Okay, no, all right, I don't know.

85
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,900
I'm thinking of like a jelly candy,

86
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,940
almost like a gum drop,

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,620
but it's just shaped like a slice of orange

88
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,460
and it's orange and it tastes like an orange.

89
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,780
Okay, yeah.

90
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,100
Yeah, I looked up what's in those

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,540
and I was intrigued to see that there's no gelatin.

92
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,860
Gummies are made with gelatin.

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm like, hmm, so what do they make it with?

94
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,180
And it's like just sugar.

95
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,980
It's like just corn syrup and sugar and

96
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,860
there was like modified corn starch

97
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,140
and I was like, I have some corn starch.

98
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,700
I was like, okay, I'll try it.

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,500
So I did try it.

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,180
And I tried like just mixing up sugars

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,260
and like cooking them down.

102
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,100
And it did, I was able to cook them down far enough

103
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
that they became like a hard candy.

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,860
And that was like, okay, that's cool.

105
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,660
But not a squishy candy.

106
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,580
Yeah, well, I was like, well, how can I get them squishy?

107
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,020
So I added some more water and they did come out soft

108
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,340
and I was able to bite them and chew them.

109
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,300
I was like, yeah, that's something, that's something.

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,980
But then I put them on my shelf

111
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,940
and I came back to them later

112
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,020
and they did not hold their shape at room temperature.

113
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,580
They had like, they flowed very slowly

114
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,580
but they had like just collapsed into a thick, hard puddle.

115
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,020
And I was like, hmm, okay, that didn't work.

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,340
But I tried it again and I added some pectin this time

117
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,380
and one of them is still too mushy,

118
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,780
but the other one that I added more pectin to, it did.

119
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,140
It kind of, it stayed, it kept its shape.

120
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,740
It's hard, it's kind of tough to bite,

121
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,900
sort of like a starburst, which is good.

122
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,700
I don't know, like the chewy, the consistency is not,

123
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,140
it's not jelly-like.

124
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,540
It's like a starburst.

125
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,260
Well, it's as chewy as a starburst.

126
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,060
It's as like hard, you know, like if you had a giant one

127
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,300
and you sunk your teeth into it,

128
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,180
it would be like, oh, my teeth got stuck in it.

129
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,340
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,820
Yeah, so I made something like that

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,620
and the consistency, it's a little bit grainy.

132
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,700
It's not like smooth jelly, like a gumdrop.

133
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,820
It's kind of grainy and I don't really like that

134
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,660
and I don't know how.

135
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,540
I wonder what starbursts are made of

136
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,340
because I feel like you could pull and stretch them

137
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
like taffy or something.

138
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah, I think I looked them up and well, you know what?

139
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's find out.

140
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,660
And chew-its, I remember chew-its.

141
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,220
I've never had those in a while.

142
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,300
You got to chew-it, chew-it.

143
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,180
I remember the advertisement.

144
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Starbursts too are, yeah, mainly corn syrup, sugar.

145
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,700
There's no, oh no, there is some gelatin in them.

146
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,780
There's some gelatin in them.

147
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,060
Modified corn starch.

148
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,100
It's funny, you read candy labels

149
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,340
and a lot of them have the exact same ingredients,

150
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,100
just like kind of switched around

151
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,620
in like a slightly different order.

152
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,420
But like it's the same shit.

153
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,660
Tapioca dextrin is interesting.

154
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,460
This is my attempt to make a cheap alternative

155
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,460
because gelatin and corn fiber are expensive

156
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,380
and those are the ones that I make for me

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,860
that I can make them low sugar

158
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,420
and I can eat lots of them and they're good for me.

159
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
I mean, more or less.

160
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,660
But I would also like to make a cheap version

161
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,020
that is just made of sugar

162
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,940
and so that's what I'm working on with these right now.

163
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,700
What if you made a gummy that you could vape?

164
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,420
It was a vapeable gummy.

165
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,980
Damn, but you could chew it too.

166
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,700
You could chew it or vape it.

167
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,580
Or you chew it and you swallow it

168
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,780
and then once you swallow it,

169
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,820
though you breathe out a big loud.

170
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,580
Yeah, it's like a little vape capsule inside, crunch it.

171
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,340
You know what I wish?

172
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,540
Unfortunately, I looked into it

173
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,140
and it seems like no, there is no way

174
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,420
to make colored vape clouds.

175
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,100
I wondered, is that possible?

176
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,620
And it seems like the answer is no.

177
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460
No.

178
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,780
Or not without it being toxic.

179
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,740
It's because a cloud would need to have

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,580
like tiny particulates of a certain color.

181
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,940
So you could do it with paint and stuff

182
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,340
or like a chemical burning in a certain way.

183
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,140
Could you not just do it

184
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,060
with like, I mean, okay.

185
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
I mean, you can take water

186
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,220
and you can add like food coloring to it

187
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,860
to make the water, you know, pink, let's say.

188
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,700
Yeah, but the water.

189
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,740
Could you not then evaporate the water

190
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,340
and like have food?

191
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,020
You'll separate the food coloring from the water.

192
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,980
The water would evaporate.

193
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,340
The food coloring doesn't.

194
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,340
Well, what if you got,

195
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,940
what if you got some kind of coloring agent

196
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,220
that had the exact same, you know,

197
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,980
fusion points or what do you,

198
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,980
evaporation point at the exact same evaporation point?

199
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,380
I mean, could you keep them like dissolved in each other

200
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,660
as a gas or as a vapor?

201
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,380
If it's a gas, as far as I understand,

202
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,380
gases that have like colors to them

203
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,460
are because like they're, you know,

204
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,300
visible to the naked eye because they're big enough.

205
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,420
The particles are big enough to be seen.

206
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,980
Yeah.

207
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,580
So it would need to be big particles

208
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,100
and also evaporate at the same time.

209
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,540
Yeah.

210
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,740
So it wouldn't be like in the cloud.

211
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,620
No.

212
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,180
I mean, if you ever tried to paint a cloud, it's difficult.

213
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,260
All the time.

214
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,660
Yeah, okay.

215
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,500
Yeah, I guess that makes it.

216
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,020
I was disappointing.

217
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,760
Disappointing to realize that that wasn't happening.

218
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,060
You could do it if you shone a light through it.

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,460
That's how they do it at music festivals.

220
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
Sean, I love that word.

221
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,380
Sean, past tense of shine.

222
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,620
It's great.

223
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,940
It's great conjugation.

224
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
Uh.

225
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,460
Next step is caffeinated dummies.

226
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,500
Caffeinated vapeable dummies.

227
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,820
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,540
They do sell caffeinated vapes.

229
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,340
They do sell caffeinated vapes,

230
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,860
which is very funny.

231
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
Injectable.

232
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,980
Oh yeah, you don't even have to chew it.

233
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,740
Don't even have to vape it.

234
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,220
You don't even have to enjoy it at all.

235
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,740
You just put it right into your bloodstream.

236
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,940
It just clogs up your arteries with sugar chunks.

237
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,820
Yeah, let's just skip.

238
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,620
Let's just skip to the good part.

239
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,940
So I was-

240
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Gummies suppositories.

241
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Yeah.

242
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
Yeah.

243
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,460
Let's, we all know why we're here.

244
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,300
Let's just get right to the point.

245
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,620
So I was,

246
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,220
I was working on my secret video project

247
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,300
and I was doing work for that prep,

248
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,180
work for that stuff for that preparation

249
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,860
and I couldn't stand it anymore.

250
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,100
I got so sick of it,

251
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,460
I had to take a break from it, step away from it.

252
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,380
So I've switched back to

253
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,740
prepping the slime and punishment book,

254
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,460
which is good because that was what I was doing originally

255
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,060
and I had originally intended to finish that.

256
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,500
So it's good that I'm trying to finish that now.

257
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,340
It is good.

258
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,100
You're getting shit done.

259
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,500
I've made pretty good progress.

260
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,940
I have a three ring binder here

261
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,940
with printed out black and white pages

262
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,100
and I'm kind of rearranging them and reorganizing them

263
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,980
to settle on a final exactly what the page order is gonna be.

264
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,260
Oh, I finished the notes.

265
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,660
I finished writing the footnotes.

266
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,540
There's like 23 pages of them.

267
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,300
Like and infinite jest,

268
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,380
they're not really like the infinite jest footnotes.

269
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,980
Those are much more interesting,

270
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,700
but it's that style anyway.

271
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,660
There's 23 pages of them and I finished writing them

272
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,780
and I handed them to some RFCK people

273
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,540
to check and proofread and they did

274
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,100
and I took their input into account and I edited them

275
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
and now they're basically done.

276
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,340
I might still add a little bit more to them.

277
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,740
But that's good.

278
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,060
That's progress.

279
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,460
That's measurable progress on an important front.

280
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,500
I also was thinking about,

281
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,500
I was thinking about like merch,

282
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,340
like sets you could get with the Kickstarter,

283
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,180
like instead of just letting people pick like,

284
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,660
oh, any one, pick one pin,

285
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,340
pick a coin or whatever,

286
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,740
I was gonna offer like a package bundle,

287
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,820
like maybe like add like $15

288
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,940
and you can have like a set of like four or five things, right?

289
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,780
So I got like-

290
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,900
Of the different RFCK pins?

291
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,820
Yeah, exactly.

292
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,660
So I've got like a little,

293
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,940
maybe like a killer,

294
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,340
a little killer bundle with a patch and a pin

295
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,620
and a my face and maybe a gun girl

296
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,180
and a juvie one with like mega slime

297
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,660
and slime corp and a poedron and a slime heart,

298
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,980
map of the city, you know.

299
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,540
I've been organizing,

300
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,420
I have them in little piles on my bed right here.

301
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,780
Thinking about how many pieces,

302
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,100
how many pieces do I group into one batch?

303
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,540
I like thinking about stuff.

305
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,740
You ever like think about stuff?

306
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,380
I do, I do think about stuff.

307
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,180
Whoa, that rules.

308
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,180
I hope soon to be back on like the productivity road.

309
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,940
At the moment, I'm still trying to like do normal things,

310
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,300
normally.

311
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,620
Yeah.

312
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,460
I got-

313
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,300
I had a pretty bad like two,

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,220
like last week was pretty bad.

315
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,460
This week has been like not great,

316
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,300
but like okay, I feel like not terrible about it.

317
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,220
So that's a win.

318
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,020
That's a big win for me.

319
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,700
Yeah, I got some,

320
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,460
I never had like antidepressants before.

321
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,780
I went to the doctor and I said,

322
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,340
oh, I'm depressed.

323
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,260
X, Y, Z and they said,

324
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,460
well, I'll try on this.

325
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,900
It's weird because like I feel like

326
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,780
I've talked about being depressed a lot as a teenager,

327
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,140
but I guess my parents just never thought

328
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,180
it was like worth worrying about.

329
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,660
It's like, oh, you're just tired of school.

330
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,820
It's like, I didn't even know

331
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
you could just get antidepressants that quickly.

332
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,100
I thought you needed like a proper full like thing.

333
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,100
So you just went to a therapist or a psychiatrist?

334
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
Just my local, my doctor.

335
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,780
Like I called them up, I had an appointment

336
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,140
and I said, I'm explaining my problems.

337
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,500
And they're like, sounds like you might need,

338
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,900
you want some antidepressants?

339
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,740
I said, yes.

340
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,660
They recommended me a thing.

341
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,620
Well, they didn't recommend,

342
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,340
they just said they were gonna put me

343
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,260
on this thing for a month, see what happens.

344
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,380
So did you just say like, hey, Doc, I'm depressed.

345
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,780
And he was like, well, I have just the thing for that?

346
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,580
Yeah, essentially.

347
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,700
Wow.

348
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,860
Huh.

349
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,260
Pretty crazy.

350
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,740
I didn't think like a regular doctor

351
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
could prescribe that for you.

352
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,540
Might be different in America.

353
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm not, or it might not be, I don't actually know.

354
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,460
Yeah, I've never really done that before.

355
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,740
I've always had the sense that you need like a,

356
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,020
like more proof.

357
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,580
Like a psychiatrist, like you would need

358
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,740
like a psychiatric evaluation or something.

359
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,460
Like you need to have sessions with your therapist

360
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,100
where you talk it out and then they might come

361
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,380
to the conclusion like, I see,

362
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,140
you have clinical depression and I will give you.

363
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,220
I think that may be how it used to work

364
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,220
when depression was, I don't know, taken less seriously.

365
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,940
Maybe it's taken more seriously.

366
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,580
I assume like after COVID,

367
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,740
loads more people were depressed than were before.

368
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,140
That's probably true.

369
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,820
And so like, it's just easier to get it now

370
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,300
because yeah, we all get it.

371
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,140
We all get it.

372
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,540
So I've been taking that

373
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,300
and the only thing that's happened so far,

374
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,860
I mean, I feel all right.

375
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,300
What are you taking, if you don't mind me asking.

376
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,620
Oh, I've got it right here.

377
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,180
It is a CetaloPram.

378
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,140
I've never heard of that.

379
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,340
CetaloPram tablets.

380
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,700
Isn't that the name of like a, no, the CetaloVision.

381
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,620
Wasn't the CetaloVision like a Nintendo console

382
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,740
that included like radio connectivity or some shit?

383
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,740
And you could play like Mario 2 with like a radio play.

384
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,860
Do you know what I'm talking about?

385
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,140
Is that like a Game Boy like add-on?

386
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
What, I have no idea.

387
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,660
Okay, I'm pretty sure I learned this from a gaming

388
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,700
historian video.

389
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,580
There was a console called the CetaloVision

390
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,540
and I know that you could play Mario 2 on it,

391
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,740
but the version of Mario 2 on the CetaloVision

392
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,220
included like audio drama tracks in between levels

393
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,420
where like Mario and the other characters

394
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,460
like had conversations with each other about,

395
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,900
I think you had to like download,

396
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,740
I think you had to like download the game

397
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,860
through the radio waves or something.

398
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,700
I don't know.

399
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
What the fuck?

400
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,460
It was some shit that they did in Japan

401
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,580
that they never were like,

402
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,780
well that didn't really work so we're not.

403
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Downloading Mario 2 through the radio.

404
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,740
I don't know, it was some shit like that.

405
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,580
That's fun.

406
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,420
Some like weird like you downloaded stuff

407
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,260
but not through like an internet connection.

408
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,700
Like it was like broadcast.

409
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,500
I might be confusing it with something else.

410
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Look anyway, it just sounds like that thing you said.

411
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,740
Yeah, so I have to take a tablet every day for a month

412
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,740
to see what happens and it's made me feel woozy.

413
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,020
It's made me feel like I might throw up

414
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,740
but I'm not actually going to.

415
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,700
And it's made me feel very yawn-y.

416
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,740
I'm not sleepy but I am yawning a lot

417
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,740
and my throat is like feels like I'm straining my muscle

418
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,900
like under my, on my neck, like under my chin.

419
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,460
You know when you're like, you're holding back tears

420
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,700
or you're trying to yawn really hard

421
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,260
and that part of your neck is like er, filled with blood.

422
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,740
I, my, neck?

423
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,900
It just feels thicker.

424
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,460
Like I don't know how to describe it.

425
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
It's just sort of like the yawn muscle under your chin.

426
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Oh, like maybe?

427
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,900
Like around the Adam's apple area.

428
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,220
I don't, I don't really think I am familiar

429
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,140
with the sensei, the particular sensation.

430
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,420
Well try to yawn, try to force a yawn

431
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,860
and you'll see what reflects.

432
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,620
Oh, the one that kind of bulges out

433
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,020
right underneath your chin.

434
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,380
Yeah.

435
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,500
Okay.

436
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,780
That's feeling a little like in constant use, I guess.

437
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,700
And it's like, it's nothing on its own is like too bad.

438
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,940
And they said there will be side effects

439
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,020
and you'll get used to them.

440
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,300
Your body will acclimate.

441
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,540
So I'm just, I'm just taking that

442
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,700
and hopefully I'll feel good.

443
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,660
I feel all right, but I also,

444
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,060
I'm aware of the fact that my low productivity

445
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,660
is not just because of depression.

446
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,820
It's also because I don't wanna do anything.

447
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,500
So I've also got to work on that.

448
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,620
But yeah, that's basically my week

449
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,780
is that I've just continued to be a layabout.

450
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Have you been a piece of shit and play all these games?

451
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
I, yeah.

452
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I finished watching Breaking Bad.

453
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
That's a good show.

454
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
That's a good show.

455
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
You ever heard of it?

456
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Yeah, the ending is not that great.

457
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,780
I didn't like the last season that much.

458
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,780
No, all right, so.

459
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
I thought everything after Spoiler,

460
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
I thought everything after Gus,

461
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
after Gus died was kind of like,

462
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,780
it never quite got as good again.

463
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,780
Kind of like after Elle died in Death Note.

464
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,780
It's like, well, the show has lost something important.

465
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,780
I felt that way the first time I watched Breaking Bad.

466
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
Watching it this time,

467
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,780
I appreciate a lot more of what's going on

468
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
because here's the thing.

469
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
My brother said this

470
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
and it was something I really agreed with.

471
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Halfway through, because the fifth season is split into two.

472
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
They released it in two things.

473
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Season five, part one, part two.

474
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,780
At the end of season five, part one,

475
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Walter has all of his money

476
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,780
and he's left the meth business.

477
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Jesse's out, Mike is gone, I think.

478
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Or Mike is dead, but Walter killed him

479
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,780
and he's just pretending that he left.

480
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,780
And it's like Walter's family is fine

481
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
and it's all good.

482
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,780
And then Hank stumbles upon

483
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Gail Bedaker's signature

484
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,780
or writing in one of the books

485
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,780
in Walt's bathroom that he picked up.

486
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,780
And he puts the pieces together

487
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,780
and realizes it's the same writing as there,

488
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
as Gail Bedaker and he's like,

489
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,780
oh my god, and then it cuts.

490
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
And then that's the end of the first part.

491
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Gail is the billionaire guy.

492
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,780
No, no, no. Gail is the other chemist,

493
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
the nerd.

494
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
The nerd?

495
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
The other guy who's like Gus's guy

496
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,780
who's cooking the meth.

497
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Oh, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
Walt has Jesse shoot him in the head

499
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
and then Jesse's traumatized.

500
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Yeah.

501
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,780
That moment there where Hank

502
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
suddenly puts the pieces together

503
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,780
and he knows that Walter White is Heisenberg

504
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,780
is where that season ends, half a season.

505
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,780
And my brother said that would be the perfect way to end the show.

506
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Instead of like the big

507
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
bombastic like machine gun thing,

508
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,780
which they set up at the beginning of the season,

509
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,780
having it be like, oh, everything's fine.

510
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
We did it.

511
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Jesse, I killed Gus and I got the money

512
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,780
and everything's good and nothing bad is going to happen to me

513
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
and then immediately Hank.

514
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
And it's like, oh, he's going to get caught.

515
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,780
And instead of seeing it, we just imply that like,

516
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
no, actually, it's fucked.

517
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,780
But then there's stuff.

519
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I don't mind it too much.

520
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,780
I just feel like it doesn't stay long enough

521
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,780
to be built up as much as Gus

522
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
before it gets destroyed.

523
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
I thought that the like,

524
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
what if they like some biker gang or something

525
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,780
or like the bad guys in the last...

526
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
They're Nazi white supremacists like criminals.

527
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,780
They got like swastika tattoos everywhere.

528
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,780
I just didn't care about them.

529
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Yeah.

530
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,780
They're, I mean, they're threatening.

531
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,780
I think it's Todd, the like psychopath boy

532
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,780
who has no remorse for killing children.

533
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,780
He's like the villain of the season,

534
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
even though he's not like in charge of stuff.

535
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,780
And he's kind of scary,

536
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,780
but he's also like, not always the focus.

537
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,780
So it's like, when Gus is gone,

538
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,780
a lot of the shows sort of like,

539
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
it feels like the epilogue,

540
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,780
like the first episode of season five

541
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
feels like an epilogue because like,

542
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
oh shit, what's gonna happen now?

543
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,780
And stuff happens.

544
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,780
True.

545
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,780
I still like it though.

546
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,780
I think the machine gun ending

547
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
and the whole like,

548
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Walter going to New Hampshire

549
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,780
and with this barrel of money

550
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,780
and being like, oh shit, I can't do anything.

551
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,780
And then he sees Gretchen and Elliot

552
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,780
from Grey Matter on the TV and they're saying,

553
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,780
oh yes, Walter White, the notorious Heisenberg.

554
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
He founded with us in our company,

555
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,780
but he's not involved.

556
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
In fact, he didn't really do anything

557
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,780
and his legacy, you know, we are shitting on it.

558
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,780
And then Walter was like, fuck you piece of shit,

559
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,780
you will shit on my legacy.

560
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,780
My ego is so big and that's the whole problem

561
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
with me as a character.

562
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
So I'm gonna come back.

563
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,780
Oh darn, I could just let it be

564
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,780
if not for this darn tragic flaw of mine.

565
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,780
Oh well.

566
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
Yeah, gotcha.

567
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,780
It's been a long time since I've watched it.

568
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,780
Yeah, I started because I just randomly

569
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,780
on YouTube that gave me clips for Breaking Bad.

570
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
I was like, oh yeah, I remember that.

571
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,780
Oh yeah, I remember this.

572
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
And he just watched like a ton of clips

573
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,780
and I was like, okay, man, let's watch the whole show again.

574
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,780
It was a good time, very good.

575
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I couldn't play anymore Mega Man.

576
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,780
I barely managed to force myself to

577
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,780
suffer through the end of X6

578
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,780
and I was like so fucking over it.

579
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,780
Mega's not looking so mega anymore.

580
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
X6 was bad.

581
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,780
I guess next I could either play

582
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,780
the fucking X7, which is when they switched,

583
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,780
they made a 3D one, which I hear is real bad.

584
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,780
But it might be funny,

585
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,780
but probably not for a whole playthrough.

586
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,780
It would probably be really tedious and agonizing.

587
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Or I could play regular Mega Man 9,

588
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
which is when they waited seven years

589
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,780
and then they made a retro one in the old 2D style,

590
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,780
which is probably pretty good.

591
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
I remember when that came out and people were like,

592
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
oh my god, it's Mega Man.

593
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,780
On YouTube at the time I followed a bunch of YouTube poop people

594
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,780
and they always made YouTube poop music videos using Mega Man music.

595
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,780
So they all loved Mega Man.

596
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,780
And then the new one came out.

597
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Not the new one.

598
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Mega Man 9 was like 2008 or 2006 or something.

599
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,780
That's what I'm talking about around that time.

600
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
They did make two more after that.

601
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,780
9 and 10 they made them and they look like they're on the NES.

602
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,780
They look like that.

603
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,780
And then 10 years went by and they made 11

604
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,780
and 11 is the 2.5D one.

605
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,780
And I think they were all supposed to be pretty good,

606
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,780
pretty as good as the old ones used to be.

607
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,780
I remember seeing footage of Mega Man 10, I think,

608
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,780
with a football, like a soccer themed stage,

609
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,780
with soccer man, sports.

610
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
That doesn't ring a...

611
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Oh, um...

612
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Strike Man, the one who's a baseball.

613
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Yeah, I don't know what he looks like,

614
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,780
but I remember the soccer balls on the stage.

615
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
His... I haven't played that one,

616
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,780
but yeah, there is a guy called Strike Man.

617
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
He's basically just a baseball.

618
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,780
His body is round and he has a catcher's mitt.

619
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,780
So that's probably what you're talking about.

620
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,780
I rewatched that Brian David Gilbert.

622
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,780
You know who that is, right?

623
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,780
What did he work for?

624
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,780
Did he work for Kotaku?

625
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,780
No, Polygon.

626
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,780
No, he worked for Polygon and he made a bunch of videos.

627
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,780
He made a bunch of videos.

628
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,780
And he does like standing in front of a board

629
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,780
and he points at it.

630
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Yes, he did the one where he went through

631
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,780
how useful are all the robot masters.

632
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,780
And that's a good video.

633
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,780
He does skip over a lot.

634
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,780
He doesn't really discuss half of the robot masters

635
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,780
because half of them are just designed to kill.

636
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
And so he just kind of put them...

637
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,780
It's like those go in their own category.

638
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,780
There's no need to discuss them.

639
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,780
You know, Napalm Man and Blade Man.

640
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,780
They basically all do the same thing.

641
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,780
Yeah, I mean, Blade Man could be a chef.

642
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,780
In fact, Napalm Man also could be a chef.

643
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,780
I mean, apparently...

644
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
I didn't know this. Apparently,

645
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Blade Man and a bunch of the robots from 2

646
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,780
were actually sort of wily,

647
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,780
sort of making his own version of the robots

648
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,780
that he stole from Light in 1.

649
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,780
So like Metal Man is sort of wily made his own cut man.

650
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,780
But instead of Cut Man, who is designed for, you know,

651
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,780
felling trees and he just reprogrammed him to fight,

652
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,780
Metal Man is like, he's that, but he's just for killing.

653
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,780
He's just for, well, not killing, but combat.

654
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,780
Yeah, so the biggest thing you could do,

655
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,780
the best thing you could do is to put a forest in his way

656
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
and you wouldn't be able to cut his way through.

657
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Yeah, Cut Man could get through that, but Metal Man couldn't.

658
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
So it's his one weakness.

659
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Although I wonder if that's like,

660
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,780
I wonder if they had that in mind when they were designing the robot.

661
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,780
No, they couldn't have because they did that thing

662
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,780
where like people would submit bosses

663
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
and they would accept submissions.

664
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,780
But they can't have been like,

665
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,780
oh, what if we made one that was kind of like Cut Man,

666
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
but a little different?

667
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Oh, I know, Blade Man.

668
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,780
They could just pick ones from the submissions

669
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,780
that would fit the criteria.

670
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Maybe that came into their judging.

671
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Maybe.

672
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Yeah.

673
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,780
Which one would fit with the world we're building the best.

674
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Yeah, possibly, yeah, possibly.

675
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,780
It's hard to know developer intentions.

676
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
They're crazy.

677
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Sometimes things will be canon.

678
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,780
For instance, Shadow Man.

679
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Shadow Man.

680
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
I mean, in Mega Man 3,

681
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,780
I don't believe there's any suggestion of this at all.

682
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,780
In Mega Man and Base,

683
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
you can find his data card or whatever

684
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,780
and it says like, oh yeah, Wily didn't make him.

685
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,780
Wily found him in like a trash can

686
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
and he fell from space

687
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
and he's made of some metal that came from space.

688
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,780
So, you know, make of that what you will.

689
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,780
So it's like, okay.

690
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Did they know that when they made three

691
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,780
or were they just thinking of like

692
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,780
factoids to retroactively apply

693
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
and they were like, hey, what if this guy

694
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
actually fell from space?

695
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Okay, that's where it changes backstory.

696
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I feel like that may probably be it

697
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,780
because like if you don't make it about,

698
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,780
I mean, for that character in particular,

699
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
if there's no instance of him

700
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,780
like being a space dweller or anything,

701
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,780
it's obviously not part of their character document.

702
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,780
He's from space and they don't make any effort

703
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
to make it clear that he's from space

704
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
and why would they make that part of his character?

705
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,780
They'd probably retroactively just do it for some reason.

706
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
For no reason?

707
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I think they do know things that like,

708
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,780
it's tough because like those games

709
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,780
have so little data to work with

710
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,780
that they definitely had things in mind

711
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,780
that they didn't put in the game.

712
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,780
So they did know more than went into the game

713
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,780
but it's like, well, okay, but how much more?

714
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Is that one of the things that they knew about them?

715
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Like, they never mention role.

716
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Like role appears in the end of Mega Man 1

717
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,780
but they never acknowledge her anywhere

718
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
in the first game at all.

719
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
They never say like what her name is

720
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,780
or what her serial number is.

721
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,780
And then later on, but they had to have known

722
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,780
because they do give other robot serial numbers

723
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,780
and there's one missing, like number two is not listed

724
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,780
and I mean it's role but they never actually say that.

725
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,780
So they just didn't have like space

726
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,780
or they just like didn't have anywhere

727
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,780
that they could conveniently put it in.

728
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,780
They don't know. So secret.

729
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
It's so secret.

730
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,780
You're gonna have to go to Japan.

731
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,780
And it's impossible to know what they knew

732
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,780
and what they made up, what they knew at the time

733
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,780
and what they just making up later.

734
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
They'll never know.

735
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,780
What does it matter Ben?

736
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,780
Who gives a shit?

737
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I care, I care because in my opinion,

738
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,780
because it, okay, here's why it matters

739
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,780
because if they were just making Mega Man in base

740
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
and they're like, oh shit,

741
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
I got to think of something to say about Shadow Man.

742
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
I don't know.

743
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,780
He's made of like meteor metal, whatever.

744
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
If they just made that up later,

745
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,780
then that's basically like J.K. Rowling being like,

746
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,780
oh yeah, there's Jews at Hogwarts.

747
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Anthony Goldstein was a Ravenclaw, you idiots.

748
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
Like obviously.

749
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,780
And I don't accept that.

750
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,780
I don't think retroactively doing things

751
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
or making meaning out of things that were once meaningless

752
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
is a bad thing.

753
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,780
I just think J.K. Rowling is like doing it for points

754
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,780
and it's really like bad of her.

755
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I think, okay, I just think there's,

756
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,780
I don't know, it feels different to me.

757
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,780
To me, it makes a difference in how I think about Shadow Man,

758
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,780
whether or not they knew at the time that he fell from space

759
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,780
versus whether they just came up with that later and said,

760
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
yeah, sure.

761
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,780
Well, I mean, you'd never be able to know.

762
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,780
And even if you asked them, they probably wouldn't remember.

763
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Because to me, what that says is that in Mega Man 3,

764
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
he didn't fall from space,

765
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,780
but then later they changed it so that he did.

766
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,780
So if you were playing 3 when 3 was out,

767
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,780
that fact would not be true.

768
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
It only became true later.

769
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,780
So to me, it's kind of not really true

770
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
if it wasn't true in the game.

771
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,780
But when you say your thoughts about Shadow Man change.

772
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,780
And I think about Shadow Man all the time.

773
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,780
What does that really mean?

774
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Like facts aside, like...

775
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I don't know, it's just a different...

776
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Does it take you out of the experience?

777
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,780
No, it doesn't take me out of the experience.

778
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,780
No, I mean, in a way that you're thinking about the developers

779
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,780
more than you're just thinking about this world that is cohesive

780
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,780
and it has rules and stuff.

781
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,780
It's not about affecting my experience.

782
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,780
I'm not trying to protect myself.

783
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
I'm not trying to protect my experience.

784
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I just want to know...

785
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
I don't know.

786
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
I just think it's different.

787
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
No, I get it.

788
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
I just want the truth with a capital T.

789
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I just don't want to be lied to.

790
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
The impulse.

791
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,780
I don't really know where it comes from either.

792
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,780
I think it's just sort of like a sense of the creator not caring.

793
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,780
But I care so much.

794
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
What the fuck?

795
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:14,780
It's kind of like the story of the development of the series then.

796
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,780
That story is different in the one scenario.

797
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,780
It's like George Lucas.

798
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Things would be different if he knew the story of the prequels

799
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,780
back when he was making the original Star Wars

800
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,780
versus the reality of the situation,

801
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,780
which is he came up with all the prequel stuff.

802
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,780
He came up with that shit later.

803
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
He was always making it up as he went along.

804
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
I feel like that's important.

805
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
It's important.

806
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,780
It's important to understanding the story of the franchise.

807
00:37:52,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I think that there is nothing wrong with learning the story

808
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,780
by going back and re-looking at it and being like,

809
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,780
okay, so this thing that I didn't mean anything for,

810
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,780
I could use and it would be retroactively set up.

811
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,780
You didn't plan for certain things to happen,

812
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,780
but with what you know and without contradicting yourself

813
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
by checking, you can make the future.

814
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
You can make new things.

815
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
I think that's fine.

816
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,780
I think that's the same.

817
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,780
But I think that if in my mind,

818
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,780
if I had the knowledge, oh, Shadow Man fell from space,

819
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:44,780
I feel like in that situation where they made that up in base,

820
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,780
I would feel like I did not have the true story.

821
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
I only had an incomplete.

822
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,780
The true story is that originally that was not the case,

823
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,780
but then later it was made the case retroactively.

824
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I feel like there is data that is lost.

825
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
If I just looked it up and found out the fact,

826
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
oh, Shadow Man fell from space.

827
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,780
That's not the whole story.

828
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,780
So part of the story of Shadow Man was that...

829
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Well, no, not...

830
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,780
I don't know what you're saying.

831
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm saying...

832
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,780
Well, I mean, canonically then,

833
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,780
in the canon of the story, Shadow Man fell from space.

834
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:35,780
But in the meta story of how the series was created,

835
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,780
only after a certain later point did that become true,

836
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,780
but it was not true at his debut.

837
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Also, your concern is if somebody were to tell the story

838
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,780
of how Mega Man were developed, that would need to be included.

839
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Yeah, if you just said...

840
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,780
If I was describing to you the plot of Mega Man 3,

841
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
and I was like, okay, and then there's Shadow Man.

842
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
And Mega Man went and he fought Shadow Man,

843
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
and Shadow Man is a master of ninjutsu magic,

844
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,780
and he is an android from space.

845
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,780
He's made of meteor metal while he found him in a scrap heap.

846
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Okay, and then Gemini Man, blah, blah, blah, blah.

847
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
I would be like, that would be like a lot.

848
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
I think that would be wrong.

849
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
I would be leaving something out,

850
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,780
because that's a retcon that did not occur until much later.

851
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,780
But is there any contradiction,

852
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:40,780
or would it ruin anything if it's like...

853
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,780
It would ruin my commitment to the truth, capital T.

854
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,780
I mean, if you really wanted you to just mention

855
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,780
that it is unknown whether he came from space at this time,

856
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:59,780
but it was then later confirmed by Data Log in this game.

857
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,780
In my opinion, I think there's a difference here.

858
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,780
If they did not intend that originally,

859
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,780
but then later they said it and decided that it was true.

860
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,780
In my opinion, it's not that it was unconfirmed,

861
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,780
and then later was confirmed.

862
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:24,780
It's that it was initially false, and then later became true.

863
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
But I... okay.

864
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,780
That's very important.

865
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,780
I feel like this is exclusively affecting you.

866
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I mean, who else is it going to affect?

867
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
I don't know.

868
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I think these are important details.

869
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,780
If you want to know what's going on in a story,

870
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,780
I feel like this makes a difference.

871
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Okay, so if it was true

872
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,780
that they retroactively decided this fact,

873
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,780
and you knew that to be the case,

874
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,780
then you could apply that logic to some other thing.

875
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Now you know that the developers are willing to do that.

876
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Would something else come to light?

877
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Well, I mean...

878
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I'm trying to figure out exactly why it's important.

879
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
I don't know.

880
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,780
It's just important for its own sake.

881
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Knowledge is just important for its own sake.

882
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Truth is just important because it is the truth.

883
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,780
Ben, Mega Man doesn't exist.

884
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,780
What?

885
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,780
Good thing I did my improv scream practice before we started.

886
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Good thing I practiced being as high pitch as I possibly can.

887
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,780
I'm distressed.

888
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,780
I would just say that to me...

889
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
It's two different stories.

890
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,780
There's the story of...

891
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Okay, Mega Man 3, Shadow Man fell from space,

892
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,780
versus Mega Man 3, Shadow was made by Wily,

893
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
but then later in Mega Man and Base,

894
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,780
they say, oh, he actually fell from space.

895
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,780
I don't know, those are like two different things.

896
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,780
And only one of them can be true.

897
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Understood.

898
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Okay.

899
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:34,780
And I like to tease this sort of thing out.

900
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,780
I wonder about it.

901
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Because it's like...

902
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,780
I don't know.

903
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,780
It's sort of like death of the author,

904
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
because it's like, okay, what's in the game?

905
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
What's actually in the game?

906
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
In 3?

907
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Is there anything actually in 3 to suggest that Shadow Man fell from space?

908
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
No?

909
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Well, then I guess he didn't.

910
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,780
I mean, Base says he did,

911
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,780
but okay, is that a new invention for them?

912
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Or was there an intention there

913
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,780
that the developers had known that,

914
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,780
they just didn't put it in,

915
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,780
but they thought it?

916
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,780
I think it's neat to think about.

917
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
You ever just think about things?

918
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,780
No, yeah, I'm trying to think myself.

919
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,780
If it was things that were scrapped for time,

920
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,780
why Shadow Man,

921
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
what significance does Shadow Man have

922
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,780
in the rest of the series post this information

923
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
that he came from space?

924
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Where from space?

925
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,780
It would make me wonder why they did that.

926
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Actually, honestly, either way,

927
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
I have to wonder why they decided

928
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,780
that this would be a thing that is true of Shadow Man,

929
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,780
because he has no significance.

930
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,780
The one connection there is that

931
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Mega Man 3 does take place

932
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,780
across different planets.

933
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
You might not even know that

934
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,780
if you were just playing the game,

935
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,780
because it's not even important.

936
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,780
But it is true.

937
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,780
So you do travel between different planets.

938
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,780
So I guess there's kind of a space theme

939
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,780
going on there?

940
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,780
So when they say he came from space,

941
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,780
is there ever any information beyond that

942
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,780
that we learn in other games?

943
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,780
I'll tell you exactly.

944
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Who built a Shadow Man?

945
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
Maybe it's Metal Sonic.

946
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
The thing about that, though,

947
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
is that actually a lot of robots

948
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,780
just come from space,

949
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,780
and that's all we know about them.

950
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Oh, you know what?

951
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,780
It's home stuck again.

952
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,780
They come out from the meteor things.

953
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,780
The ectobiology.

954
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,780
The bad guys in Mega Man V on the Game Boy

955
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,780
are the star droids who are just from space.

956
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,780
Who made them?

957
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,780
Nobody knows.

958
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,780
Duo from Mega Man VIII

959
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,780
and Power Battle and Power Fighters.

960
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,780
Duo is just a robot cop from space,

961
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,780
and apparently some interviewer asked Inafune,

962
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,780
okay, so what's his deal?

963
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,780
He's a cop from space.

964
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,780
Is there a police force?

965
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Does he belong to an organization?

966
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
Where is he from?

967
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,780
Inafune was just like,

968
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,780
man, I don't know.

969
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
It's like an action game.

970
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Who cares?

971
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
Yeah.

972
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
That would lend credits to the idea

973
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,780
that they came up with that thing retroactively.

974
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,780
Wouldn't it be cool if he came from space?

975
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,780
Yeah, it would be cool.

976
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
But why?

977
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,780
But why make that change?

978
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,780
You know what?

979
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,780
I didn't even think about this,

980
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,780
but I kind of think Shadow Man,

981
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,780
he's not just a ninja.

982
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,780
I think he just seems like the kind of ninja

983
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,780
who fell from space.

984
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
I don't know.

985
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
He just looks like that kind of guy.

986
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,780
That is exactly how it happened

987
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,780
in the writer's room.

988
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,780
That's exactly how it happened,

989
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,780
but in Japanese.

990
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
It's...

991
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,780
Hang on.

992
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,780
I'm looking...

993
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,780
Here we go.

994
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Shadow Man.

995
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Here we go, Shadow Man.

996
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,780
Skilled Martial Artist,

997
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,780
Master of Ninjutsu Magic.

998
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Uh...

999
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,780
Damn it.

1000
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Okay, his...

1001
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,780
His Shadow Blade is coated with a special

1002
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,780
and deadly liquid?

1003
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,780
What?

1004
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,780
No, that's not it.

1005
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
Do what if Mega Man and Roll

1006
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,780
and Proton Man

1007
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,780
and Axel and...

1008
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,780
I don't know, the characters.

1009
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,780
If the characters played Suburb,

1010
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,780
what would happen?

1011
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,780
It would be cool and fun.

1012
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,780
It would be like they're robots,

1013
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,780
but they're playing Suburb.

1014
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,780
Okay, I don't even know where this comes from now.

1015
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,780
I guess it's not from his Mega Man and Base profile.

1016
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,780
Where does this information even come from?

1017
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,780
The Shadow Man's body does not match

1018
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,780
any material found on Earth.

1019
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,780
Oh, God.

1020
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,780
Oh, no.

1021
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,780
What?

1022
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,780
I think it's from...

1023
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,780
It's from, like, a fan newsletter

1024
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,780
that, like, kids in Japan

1025
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,780
had to, like, sign up to receive by mail.

1026
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,780
That's where that comes from.

1027
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,780
So kids were asking,

1028
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,780
well, what the fuck's with the Shadow Man?

1029
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,780
No, they weren't asking.

1030
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,780
They weren't asking.

1031
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,780
They just got a little pamphlet.

1032
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,780
They didn't ask for this, but here it is.

1033
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,780
They just got a little pamphlet in the mail

1034
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,780
that's like, hey, here's some profiles about some robots.

1035
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,780
Let me tell you about Shadow Man.

1036
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,780
He's made of, like, space metal

1037
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,780
and evolved for space.

1038
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,780
So an intern came up with it.

1039
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,780
He was just like, you gotta write something.

1040
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,780
Yeah, that seems like...

1041
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,780
The metal of Shadow Man

1042
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,780
does not match any material found on Earth.

1043
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,780
My conjecture is that he may have been created

1044
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,780
and left behind by some ancient civilization

1045
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
on another planet.

1046
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,780
Then it's likely that Wiley remodeled him

1047
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,780
to suit his own maligned purposes.

1048
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,780
How can I even believe?

1049
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,780
Can I even trust this pamphlet?

1050
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,780
I mean, if that's the only source.

1051
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,780
This is what I mean.

1052
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,780
The wiki just tells you it like it's a fact.

1053
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,780
Like, it's just established canon.

1054
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Don't trust me, bro.

1055
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,780
Just trust me, bro.

1056
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
Shadow Man is an alien.

1057
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,780
But then you look into it,

1058
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,780
and it's like, this is where that comes from.

1059
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,780
They don't even say alien.

1060
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,780
They say ancient civilization.

1061
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,780
On another planet.

1062
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
I would...

1063
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
Yeah.

1064
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,780
You know?

1065
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,780
So I've arrived at probably the best answer I'm gonna get.

1066
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,780
And now it's just a matter of interpretation

1067
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,780
of like, do I think...

1068
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:37,780
Do I think that a monthly newsletter by mail,

1069
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,780
circulated by Konami or Capcom or whatever,

1070
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,780
is that canon?

1071
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
I don't know.

1072
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,780
I think you'd have to look into who wrote it.

1073
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Or like, check out a pamphlet to see what other kinds of facts they give.

1074
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,780
And if this one is in line with those,

1075
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,780
or if it's like an outlier and like, way too strange.

1076
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
I don't...

1077
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
It's not that it's too strange.

1078
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,780
It's not that this piece of information is like,

1079
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,780
doesn't fit in the canon.

1080
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,780
Like, it's...

1081
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,780
No, no.

1082
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,780
I mean, like, the...

1083
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,780
It would be weird to get your information from this pamphlet

1084
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,780
because they come up with so many wacky things.

1085
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,780
That the games have no...

1086
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,780
Like, how many of things in the pamphlet are represented in the game?

1087
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,780
I think there's a lot of stuff like this that is not in the game.

1088
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,780
And the only way you would know it is if you read a pamphlet like this.

1089
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,780
Like, for instance,

1090
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,780
Proto Man's Whole Deal.

1091
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Proto Man's Whole Deal is like, not explained anywhere

1092
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,780
until fucking Mega Man the Power Fighters 2,

1093
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,780
which was an arcade cabinet game.

1094
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,780
And that's...

1095
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,780
Yeah.

1096
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,780
You'd have to draw a line somewhere of...

1097
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,780
If you're going on the game's franchise,

1098
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,780
games are made by multiple people,

1099
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,780
do you include any and all of the people involved in the official making of

1100
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,780
merchandise for the game,

1101
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,780
or do you draw the line at just what's in the game,

1102
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,780
in which case there is no story for a lot of these things,

1103
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,780
or does it have to be written by a specific author or writer?

1104
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Yeah, I mean...

1105
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,780
Because this pamphlet, it may have been...

1106
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,780
Like, they may have consulted Inafune,

1107
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,780
they may have consulted the team about the answers to these questions.

1108
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,780
But they'd probably be busy.

1109
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,780
I feel like it may have just...

1110
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Some of them could be just written like,

1111
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,780
come up with something.

1112
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Probably the team was consulted.

1113
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,780
Sure.

1114
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,780
Yeah, but they might have just come up with something.

1115
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,780
But where do you draw that line, Ben?

1116
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
I think...

1117
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,780
I mean, okay, what's in the game,

1118
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,780
what's in the game is, you know,

1119
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,780
inarguable, unless two things contradict each other.

1120
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
And then...

1121
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,780
That's a split timeline.

1122
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,780
Yeah, then it's a split timeline, obviously.

1123
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,780
I would say that developer intention is important.

1124
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,780
I would say that if the developer says,

1125
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,780
oh yeah, that's true.

1126
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,780
I didn't put it in the game, but it's true.

1127
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,780
I guess I would accept that,

1128
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,780
unless something in the game contradicts it,

1129
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,780
and then I would probably have to say,

1130
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,780
well, what's in the game takes precedence over

1131
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,780
what the developer says was supposed to be in the game.

1132
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
And then...

1133
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,780
And then when you get to supplementary materials like this,

1134
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,780
I mean, my...

1135
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,780
Okay, I guess my instinct is to say,

1136
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,780
I would say that this is canon.

1137
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,780
I'm gonna say this is canon.

1138
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
It's just...

1139
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,780
But again, the question then is like,

1140
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,780
well, but was it the intended canon when they made it,

1141
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,780
or did someone ask later, and then later they're like,

1142
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,780
ah!

1143
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,780
Wait a minute.

1144
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,780
Okay.

1145
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,780
Never mind.

1146
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,780
This can't be where this comes from,

1147
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,780
because the question that this answer is answering,

1148
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,780
the question is, is it true that Rockman 3's Shadowman

1149
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,780
is an extraterrestrial robot?

1150
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,780
So there must have been a clue about this somewhere else.

1151
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
But where?

1152
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,780
But where?

1153
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,780
You go deep dive.

1154
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
Okay.

1155
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,780
The column all...

1156
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,780
The translator has made a note here.

1157
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,780
The column also addressed two of the most mysterious robots

1158
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,780
to ever appear, Shadowman and Quint.

1159
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Even Dr. Wright seems to be at a bit of a loss

1160
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,780
surrounding their origins,

1161
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,780
but after the event knowledge of Quint...

1162
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,780
No, I don't even want to get...

1163
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,780
I don't even want to get into Quint.

1164
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,780
That's...

1165
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,780
That's too...

1166
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,780
That's too deep.

1167
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,780
No, he doesn't really say anything.

1168
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
Where?

1169
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
Alright, well, never mind.

1170
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,780
I've actually learned nothing because...

1171
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,780
The actual story of Shadowman

1172
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,780
must have originated earlier than this.

1173
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,780
Archaeology is tough.

1174
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,780
You really got to go digging.

1175
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,780
As Shadowman is possibly an alien in origin,

1176
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,780
he may be a precursor to other alien robot.

1177
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1178
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,780
I can do wild speculation too.

1179
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,780
No problem.

1180
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,780
See, the thing is...

1181
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
There's...

1182
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,780
They could always continually expand upon Shadowman

1183
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,780
in the future.

1184
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,780
I think...

1185
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,780
With a lot of creative stuff,

1186
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,780
when you're building a story with many characters

1187
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,780
and large backstories and all this...

1188
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,780
this world building,

1189
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,780
you won't have a perfect answer for everything all at once.

1190
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,780
You will have the main plot.

1191
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,780
You will have the main character.

1192
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
You will have the antagonist.

1193
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:16,780
You'll have large parts of it all fit together very nicely.

1194
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,780
And then the rest could be vague.

1195
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,780
And you'll come up with an answer once somebody asks you,

1196
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,780
like, what is the deal with this?

1197
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,780
That's just how a lot of these things work.

1198
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,780
At the end of the day,

1199
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,780
it has no impact at all on anything else about the story,

1200
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,780
whether Shadowman is an alien.

1201
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,780
I just want to know.

1202
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,780
I would guess that it was just retroactive.

1203
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,780
Because you can only go off of what they put in the game.

1204
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,780
Unless you have access to some information

1205
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,780
or notes or developer sketches

1206
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,780
that show Shadowman being an alien,

1207
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,780
you will have no proof either way

1208
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
to prove what they were trying to do with him.

1209
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,780
So you can only go off of what is in the game at the time.

1210
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,780
Okay, well, this pamphlet...

1211
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,780
this pamphlet...

1212
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,780
I'm leaning more towards Canon, actually,

1213
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,780
because this pamphlet is from 1994,

1214
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,780
which was...

1215
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,780
okay, that was four years after Mega Man 3 came out.

1216
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:32,780
So, okay, so the clues about that might have been dropped in

1217
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,780
any number of other games, so...

1218
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,780
I think...

1219
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:47,780
I do get the impression that the team probably had a lot of thoughts

1220
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:53,780
and ideas and sort of lore about the characters

1221
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,780
and the robot masters and stuff

1222
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,780
that didn't make it into the games

1223
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,780
just because the games are small,

1224
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,780
the NES cartridges have very limited data, etc.

1225
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,780
This is...

1226
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,780
I would believe that they had an idea like this about him.

1227
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,780
Like, it's not crazy that they might have.

1228
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,780
I just...

1229
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,780
So I guess I would default to assuming

1230
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,780
that they did...

1231
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,780
that this is their intention,

1232
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,780
unless I had some good reason to think that it wasn't.

1233
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,780
And I mean, I guess the fact that it's mentioned

1234
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,780
nowhere, anywhere at all until, like, years later

1235
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,780
would be kind of a clue that maybe no, they didn't...

1236
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,780
do this until later, but then it's like a question of how many years.

1237
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,780
And it's very...

1238
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,780
His design, if he looks similar to other robots that come from space?

1239
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,780
Well, the thing about that is that

1240
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,780
most of the other robots that came from space

1241
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,780
don't look any different from any other robots.

1242
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,780
So, not really, no.

1243
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,780
Well, I could imagine that they have this idea.

1244
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,780
They had this at-the-time idea that some robots come from space.

1245
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,780
Not all robots are made by Dr. Light or Dr. Wiley or whatever.

1246
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,780
Some robots come out of space, like they have that idea,

1247
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,780
the vague sense of there being more robots out there

1248
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:30,780
and then not having the time to really flesh that out in the game,

1249
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,780
but knowing that some of them could be,

1250
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,780
and then they decide later Shadow Man was one of them.

1251
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:43,780
It's the... I mean, since 3 takes place on other planets,

1252
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,780
again, like, yeah, it wouldn't be that crazy

1253
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,780
for one guy to be like,

1254
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,780
oh, well, this guy is from an ancient civilization on another planet.

1255
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,780
It's just that there's literally nothing about Shadow Man

1256
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,780
that seems like to indicate that or hint at it

1257
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,780
or tie in with that at all.

1258
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,780
He's a ninja.

1259
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Maybe they mean ancient civilization as an allegory for ancient Japan.

1260
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,780
It's like an ancient Japan planet.

1261
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,780
I don't think so.

1262
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,780
Yeah, maybe.

1263
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,780
Ancient civilization, another planet.

1264
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Maybe our Earth is where real Japan is.

1265
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
No, Mega Man Earth.

1266
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,780
Mega Man takes place on Earth.

1267
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,780
It takes place on Earth in the city of Monsteropolis.

1268
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,780
That's not true.

1269
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,780
That's what it says in the guidebook for Game 1,

1270
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,780
but only in English.

1271
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,780
Is Shadow Man explained in a pamphlet,

1272
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,780
in a how-to-play booklet?

1273
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:50,780
The booklet, it does not have a character bio on it.

1274
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,780
It just lists him as one of the bosses.

1275
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,780
I mean, the Japanese one might have more in it,

1276
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,780
but probably not.

1277
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,780
It's just the same text, but has the word alien at the end.

1278
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,780
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1279
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,780
It might be in...

1280
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,780
No, those lore books came out years and years later.

1281
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,780
It wouldn't be in one of those books.

1282
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,780
You would need a proof at the time for during development

1283
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,780
to answer this question.

1284
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,780
You would need the developer notes.

1285
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,780
There is a...

1286
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,780
A little sketches.

1287
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,780
There is a...

1288
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,780
That's funny.

1289
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,780
Something that I found...

1290
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,780
I found that...

1291
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,780
This is maybe the biggest piece of Mega Man's...

1292
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,780
I found this and I was fascinated by it.

1293
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,780
The more I thought about it, the more doubt was cast upon me.

1294
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,780
At first, I found this and I was like,

1295
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,780
Oh my God, it's so clarifying.

1296
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,780
This explains everything.

1297
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,780
And that explains less and less.

1298
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,780
There's a note, like a piece of paper,

1299
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:07,780
that some guy found at a Rockman 20th anniversary.

1300
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,780
Not like a convention.

1301
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,780
Some kind of convention or party or something.

1302
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,780
And a bunch of developers were there and they had a...

1303
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,780
And apparently, just some Japanese guy on Twitter

1304
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,780
posted that at some guy's table,

1305
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:27,780
some developer's table, he found a piece of paper

1306
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:32,780
that had a little flowchart written on it in ballpoint pen.

1307
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,780
And it sort of sketched out the relationships between

1308
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,780
Dr. Light, Dr. Wiley, Mega Man, X, Proto Man, Zero,

1309
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:45,780
the Maverick Virus, Sigma, Dr. Kane, etc.

1310
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,780
And it's all there and it's like,

1311
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,780
Okay, makes sense.

1312
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,780
And I think it is generally...

1313
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,780
The wiki seems to just take it at face value.

1314
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,780
That like, oh yeah, the developer had this.

1315
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,780
So that means that they must have been working off of this document.

1316
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,780
This must have been an early design document for when they're making it.

1317
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,780
But it's not true. It does not have to be that.

1318
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,780
What if he wrote that at any point in the future?

1319
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,780
This is not necessarily proof that,

1320
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,780
oh, they had all of this design from the beginning.

1321
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,780
This could have been something that he sketched up,

1322
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,780
you know, 15 years later.

1323
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,780
Maybe just to like, remind himself how it all worked

1324
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,780
or just maybe to illustrate it to someone who didn't know

1325
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,780
and he wanted to show them or something, right?

1326
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,780
Like, it's not...

1327
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,780
It's really not strong proof of anything

1328
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,780
other than that it's what he thinks now.

1329
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,780
Clearly, it's what he considers to be canon

1330
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,780
as of whenever he wrote it.

1331
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,780
But we don't know when he wrote it.

1332
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,780
It doesn't prove that this was the plan all along, right?

1333
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
Uh, no.

1334
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,780
Okay, because the games are just so vague in so many regards

1335
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,780
that it's sometimes be like,

1336
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,780
but did they mean it to be like that?

1337
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,780
Or did they just bullshit me?

1338
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,780
I don't know, I've probably been thinking way too much about this.

1339
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,780
Uh, yeah.

1340
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1341
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,780
I mean, it's fun to think about things a lot, so it's not a problem.

1342
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,780
Yeah, you like think about things?

1343
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,780
I do, I do think about things.

1344
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,780
I like thinking about things.

1345
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,780
Cool, we should like think about things together sometime.

1346
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,780
Yeah.

1347
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,780
I have to pee, I'll be back in a second.

1348
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,780
Oh yeah, well I have to pee, I'll be back in a second.

1349
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,780
Aw, shh.

1350
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,780
A few moments later.

1351
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
Mega Man.

1352
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,780
Shadow Man.

1353
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,780
Shadow Man.

1354
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,780
Shadow Man, da-nah-da-nah-nah, da-nah-da-nah.

1355
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,780
Da-nah-da-da, da-nah-da, da-nah-da,

1356
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,780
Shadow Man!

1357
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,780
Oh, I've said enough about that guy.

1358
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,780
Damn, we've been going for an hour.

1359
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:19,780
Babbling about Shadow Man for an hour.

1360
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:24,780
Yep. We're shadows of our former selves.

1361
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:33,780
Well, shit. What else have I got going on this week?

1362
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:42,780
I'm trying to get a contract signed for my new place.

1363
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,780
I saw a bunch of houses. I don't want a house hunt anymore.

1364
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,780
I'm just trying to get the one that was the most palatable.

1365
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,780
I'm just trying to contact that guy and just be like,

1366
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,780
please just sign me up. Please just sign me up for September.

1367
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,780
Get me some residence, please.

1368
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,780
He told me he was going to send me a contract to sign,

1369
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:13,780
but I haven't got it yet, so I'm still waiting on that.

1370
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:18,780
I hate it. I hate moving. I hate house hunting.

1371
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:24,780
I hate moving. I hate talking to my landlord.

1372
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,780
I know that before I move out, there's going to be some bullshit.

1373
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,780
There's going to be some fucking bullshit confrontation.

1374
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,780
My stupid landlord, that's coming. I can feel it.

1375
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
I won't escape.

1376
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,780
You're going to have to fight?

1377
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,780
Probably, yeah.

1378
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,780
Probably. I'll have to argue about something.

1379
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:46,780
She will try to pull some nonsense and try to get me to pay extra fees

1380
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,780
or give her more money for something.

1381
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:54,780
Tell me that I broke my contract somehow and now I owe her something.

1382
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Some crap like that.

1383
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,780
Just remember the golden rule, you don't have to do anything.

1384
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,780
I don't have to do anything.

1385
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,780
And if I do have to do something.

1386
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,780
You just walk out. You just leave.

1387
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,780
The only way she can compel me.

1388
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,780
The only way she can compel me to do anything is by taking me to court,

1389
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,780
which will not be worth the effort.

1390
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,780
I think I can probably get away with a lot if I'm just really stubborn about it.

1391
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,780
Back in the day, house hunting was so much easier.

1392
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,780
You would get around with your guys.

1393
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,780
You would bang your putts and pans together.

1394
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,780
Get your clubs and spears and you would hunt that house.

1395
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,780
You would throw a spear right in the window.

1396
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:42,780
You would catch it and you would roast it over the open fire and you would eat it.

1397
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:47,780
Those were the days. Delicious.

1398
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:53,780
That's funny. That was a funny turn of phrase.

1399
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,780
It is kind of like a hunt.

1400
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,780
You have to be the first one to get your prey.

1401
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,780
Otherwise someone else will eat.

1402
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,780
Yeah, pretty much.

1403
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:11,780
Then you'll starve to death on the streets.

1404
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,780
This place that I'm moving to is going to be slightly more expensive than my current place,

1405
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:18,780
but not by a lot.

1406
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:23,780
It'll be like $50 a month more, so whatever. It's fine.

1407
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,780
The location is a little worse.

1408
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,780
It's a little bit further away from everything, but it's not that much further, so it's fine.

1409
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,780
It's just like a 15-minute walk anywhere instead of a 10-minute walk.

1410
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,780
Who cares?

1411
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,780
You should buy a scooter and scoot around.

1412
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,780
I was thinking about buying a Vespa.

1413
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,780
Maybe I should just buy a Vespa.

1414
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,780
You know, like in Fooley Cooley?

1415
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,780
Oh, the little yeah, yeah.

1416
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,780
I have considered buying a Vespa.

1417
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,780
Maybe I should just buy a Vespa.

1418
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,780
That'd be funny.

1419
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Does that have like a license required, like a motorbike? Is it classed as that?

1420
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:12,780
Or is it not technically a motorbike and it's sort of different?

1421
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:23,780
You might need a separate license than a driver's license to drive one.

1422
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,780
It might be operateable with a motorcycle license.

1423
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,780
Maybe? I don't know.

1424
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,780
Curious, curious.

1425
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,780
I should look into that.

1426
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,780
I don't know.

1427
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:46,780
I was thinking maybe I should get back on Tinder.

1428
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,780
I haven't done that in a while.

1429
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,780
I can roll up on your Vespa.

1430
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,780
This is unrelated to the Vespa.

1431
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:58,780
But sure, yeah, also that.

1432
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,780
I found Tinder really annoying.

1433
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,780
The last time I used it, it was like, it must be like over two years ago.

1434
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,780
I found it really annoying.

1435
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,780
My results were dismal.

1436
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,780
I got really frustrated with it.

1437
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,780
Just pissed me off.

1438
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,780
So I gave up on it.

1439
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,780
But I never canceled my subscription.

1440
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,780
I've been paying for it for like once a year.

1441
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,780
Even though it's free.

1442
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,780
I got like gold or whatever.

1443
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,780
Whatever.

1444
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:37,780
It does like all dating apps thrive on people not getting together.

1445
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:38,780
Yeah.

1446
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,780
The longer you're on the app, the more money you're spending.

1447
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,780
True.

1448
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:45,780
True though.

1449
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,780
It always rubbed me the wrong way.

1450
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,780
Those sorts of things.

1451
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:56,780
Kind of like gyms, which they operate on selling you a gym subscription

1452
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,780
and then hope that you don't use it.

1453
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,780
LaMalle.

1454
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,780
Yeah.

1455
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,780
But anyway.

1456
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:11,780
And they make sure you don't come to the gym by putting spiders all over the equipment.

1457
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,780
And then you don't want to touch them.

1458
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,780
They love that.

1459
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:17,780
They love their spiders over at Workout World.

1460
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:25,780
I still have a small little blip on my credit history from when I canceled my card

1461
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:32,780
rather than continue to pay Workout World their fee for the rest of the year that I had signed up for.

1462
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,780
Fuck them.

1463
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,780
Fuck them.

1464
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:46,780
I'm done.

1465
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,780
I'm done.

1466
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,780
I got nothing.

1467
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,780
I got nothing else.

1468
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:50,780
I'm empty.

1469
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,780
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

1470
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,780
Do you want to do voicemails?

1471
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,780
No.

1472
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,780
No.

1473
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,780
There's going to be something I can say.

1474
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,780
Oh, Boris Johnson.

1475
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,780
He's resigning.

1476
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:12,780
Oh, fucking the Shinzo Abe is dead.

1477
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,780
That's not Boris Johnson.

1478
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,780
No, but they're both Prime Ministers.

1479
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,780
Oh, I guess so.

1480
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Well, that's the news, everybody.

1481
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:26,780
Did you see the gun that the guy shot Shinzo with?

1482
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,780
Yeah, it was made of plywood and like gaffer tape.

1483
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,780
Yeah, hit him with a contraption.

1484
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,780
Very, very good.

1485
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:40,780
Like a slingshot scout with bullets in it.

1486
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:46,780
Yeah, built out of like 3D printed, whatever stuff.

1487
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,780
See, America, you have no excuse.

1488
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:57,780
It is so sad that Japan has had two gun related deaths this year and one of them was the Prime Minister.

1489
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:02,780
Well, the former Prime Minister and we have fucking 200 every fucking day.

1490
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,780
And it's never a politician.

1491
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,780
It's always children at school.

1492
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Children at school and I don't know, random people at parades.

1493
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:16,780
Yeah.

1494
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,780
I mean, never the important people who do bad.

1495
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,780
It's embarrassing.

1496
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,780
By existing.

1497
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,780
It sucks so much.

1498
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,780
It's so sad.

1499
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:31,780
I think if we were killing 200 politicians a day, things would actually get done.

1500
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,780
That's all I'm saying.

1501
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:38,780
Direct those bullets in the proper direction.

1502
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,780
You got to get a bullet mirror.

1503
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,780
I reflect them.

1504
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:51,780
I retweeted on the endless war account a post showing, you know, the guy pulling out his like weird giant like homebrew gun.

1505
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:58,780
And the caption was the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip and he did.

1506
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,780
This is big iron.

1507
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:06,780
It's great.

1508
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,780
Did anything else interesting happen?

1509
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:15,780
No, no, I mean, interesting things are always happening, but we're used to them.

1510
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,780
So they're not interesting.

1511
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,780
Like the Ukrainian war is still happening, but nobody's talking about it.

1512
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
Oh, right.

1513
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,780
Yeah, that's I'm over that.

1514
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:31,780
They occasionally check the news to see what has been happening and it's like Ukrainians being pushed back a little bit more.

1515
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:38,780
Oh, dang, it looks like Russia is going to get the Luhansk region or whatever it's called.

1516
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:39,780
Oh, dang.

1517
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,780
And that's sad.

1518
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,780
But they're still fighting.

1519
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,780
So, you know, it's just sort of like the same.

1520
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,780
Well, yeah, there is no news about it.

1521
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,780
They have been bombing.

1522
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:58,780
There was like a talk in Kiev and they bombed somewhat.

1523
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,780
No, wait, it wasn't in Kiev.

1524
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,780
I don't know.

1525
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,780
They just do in bombing.

1526
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,780
They do in bombing.

1527
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,780
Oh, did I?

1528
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:17,780
I mean, yeah, I know that it's still going on, but it's so like I have nothing to say about the war in Ukraine.

1529
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:24,780
But did I mention last week that that that indie apocalypse thing came out, that thing that featured my game in it?

1530
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:28,780
I don't know if you mentioned it on the show, but I did see it on Twitter.

1531
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,780
Yeah, that guy, pizza pranks.

1532
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:36,780
The this month's this month's issue of indie apocalypse is out on itch.

1533
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:46,780
You can buy it and it's, you know, it features, you know, a little write up of my my game and that's pretty cool.

1534
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:58,780
This guy, this guy, this guy gives, he gives basically all the money that he makes selling his, his zine to the, you know, to the people that contribute games to it.

1535
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,780
So he seems pretty cool.

1536
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:13,780
I was, I was going to be on like a, I had, I had signed up to be on like a, like a, I guess not a, I don't know if it's a live show, but sort of like a discussion show.

1537
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:23,780
I was going to have like a little segment, just like a little brief, like creator interview segment on like a little show, but I like didn't see the email in time for when it was happening.

1538
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,780
So I missed it.

1539
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,780
Yeah.

1540
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:27,780
Yeah.

1541
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,780
Oh well.

1542
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:30,780
Is it discussing the game?

1543
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:38,780
Yeah, I think he was, I think they were going to like, you know, ask me stuff about the game or something.

1544
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:44,780
So, well, maybe next, maybe I'll be on the next one or something.

1545
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,780
But seems like a really cool guy.

1546
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,780
And I just think it's really neat.

1547
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,780
But he's like, you know, he's selling his zine, but like he's not out.

1548
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,780
He's not making any money off it.

1549
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,780
I should be.

1550
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,780
He's doing all that work, organizing things.

1551
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,780
He's just doing it for the love of the games.

1552
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,780
Yeah.

1553
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,780
He's very pure.

1554
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,780
He's pure of heart.

1555
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,780
He won't last one second in this industry.

1556
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,780
Well, I mean, he's been doing this for years.

1557
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,780
He'll die by the end of the day.

1558
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,780
I'll make sure of it.

1559
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,780
Oh, he's weak.

1560
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,780
I bet we can undercut his market.

1561
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,780
Yeah, we can buy him out.

1562
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,780
Revs up chainsaw.

1563
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:47,780
If he's if he's not gouging, then we will download the zine and sell it at a markup

1564
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,780
and then bully him off the site.

1565
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:59,780
We'll download his digital zine and we'll mint it on the blockchain and we'll sell it as NFTs.

1566
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:06,780
And then we'll print it on paper and we'll sell physical copies in real life.

1567
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:14,780
I think I saw like somebody, an article talking about like, what if you could have a physical

1568
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:18,780
version of your cryptocurrency?

1569
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,780
That's like making like little coins or little paper.

1570
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,780
That's what slime coin is.

1571
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:27,780
It's the first cryptocurrency that's in, you know, non-fungible physical token.

1572
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,780
Yes, that's what it is.

1573
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:36,780
There's like a little, I think it was on some Twitter that like crypto bros taking L's.

1574
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,780
Yeah.

1575
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,780
No, it's just like, yeah, Bitcoin, but like paper version.

1576
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:41,780
Look at this.

1577
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,780
We've got like a thing on it.

1578
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:44,780
There's coins.

1579
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,780
It's like, oh, wow, interesting.

1580
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,780
Stupid.

1581
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,780
Fascinating.

1582
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:54,780
You have this piece of paper and then the value of it fluctuates.

1583
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,780
By the time you're handing it over to the cashier, they said, oh, this is not enough,

1584
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,780
actually.

1585
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,780
This is the...

1586
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,780
Not enough to pay for the thing you were just about to buy.

1587
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,780
No, because the price just fluctuated.

1588
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,780
Yeah.

1589
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:07,780
Right.

1590
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,780
This is like...

1591
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,780
You just stand there for a few hours like, it'll go back up.

1592
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,780
I'll just wait.

1593
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,780
No, it's...

1594
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:26,780
This is like the mindset of people that reinvent vending machines and call them bodega boxes.

1595
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,780
I've heard of bodega boxes.

1596
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:32,780
What are they?

1597
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,780
They're just vending machines.

1598
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,780
They're just like bespoke vending machines that are like horizontal.

1599
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:42,780
Like you lifted them up like a treasure chest?

1600
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:46,780
Someone just invented a vending machine but like shaped it differently and thought it

1601
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,780
was a new invention.

1602
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,780
What was that?

1603
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,780
Wall.

1604
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,780
You ever see that thing, juicero?

1605
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,780
Juicero, yeah, I know that.

1606
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,780
Yeah.

1607
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,780
The guy who sold packets.

1608
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,780
The thing that Casey Neistat really liked.

1609
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,780
Oh, god, really?

1610
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,780
He had one in his office for a while.

1611
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,780
He's just like, oh, I love this thing.

1612
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:09,780
What a fucking moron.

1613
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,780
Juice is great.

1614
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,780
I know.

1615
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:18,780
Okay, wasn't the thing with juicero that like it's literally just a machine that you

1616
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:25,780
put a pack of juice in and the machine just like opens the pack and squeezes the juice

1617
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,780
out of the pack of juice that you bought?

1618
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,780
Yeah, if you puncture it, you can squeeze it out yourself.

1619
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:38,780
Or you could buy our proprietary machine that will puncture and squeeze a juice box

1620
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:39,780
for you.

1621
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:43,780
It's just so stupid.

1622
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,780
Insanity.

1623
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,780
Casey Neistat really, wow.

1624
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:51,780
I mean, he doesn't look too hard into things.

1625
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,780
It's like, oh, cool, new tech and I love juice.

1626
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,780
I always get a juice from the local juice place.

1627
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:00,780
I haven't thought about Casey Neistat in a while.

1628
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,780
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing.

1629
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:06,780
I think he may just still be doing Casey Neistat vlogs.

1630
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,780
Yeah, sure.

1631
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,780
He's a celebrity.

1632
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,780
Why would you ever have to do anything else?

1633
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,780
Yeah.

1634
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,780
Good for him.

1635
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,780
He's juicing.

1636
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,780
He's blogging and juicing.

1637
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,780
Juicing and blogging.

1638
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:29,780
Yeah, I mean, I only heard of juicero after it was already a meme.

1639
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,780
I didn't know about it when it was a real thing.

1640
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,780
I didn't hear about it as like a cool thing,

1641
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,780
but I only saw it in that Casey Neistat thing.

1642
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,780
It's like, dang, he's so rich.

1643
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:42,780
He's got a juicer.

1644
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,780
I didn't know that it was a stupid idea.

1645
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,780
I just thought, oh, I guess he's a rich guy.

1646
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,780
He has rich people things.

1647
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,780
Damn, I wish I could afford juice.

1648
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,780
I just assumed it was like better than normal juice.

1649
01:21:55,780 --> 01:22:03,780
No, man, juicero juice is like, this ain't your daddy's juice.

1650
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:07,780
I guess the idea is, oh, freshly squeeze,

1651
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,780
like you squeeze it and then drink it immediately.

1652
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,780
Yeah, but.

1653
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:14,780
But it's already a juice.

1654
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:17,780
It's just in there.

1655
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,780
He just reinvented a juice box that you can't open.

1656
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,780
It's a fucking capri sun.

1657
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,780
Yeah.

1658
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:31,780
A capri sun that you need a contraption to get at.

1659
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,780
Oh my God.

1660
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,780
You're going to hit him with a contraption with the thing.

1661
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:42,780
How many times, how many times have you done the put the the straw

1662
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:47,780
through both sides of the capri sun when you're trying to drink?

1663
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,780
I mean, I probably did at least once as a kid.

1664
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,780
I've done it a lot of times and it's very like I have to be very sure

1665
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:59,780
that the two sides are not touching when I start piercing the thing.

1666
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:03,780
I can't even remember the last time I had a capri sun.

1667
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,780
Well, I guess it hasn't been.

1668
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,780
It's been a while for me as well.

1669
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,780
Maybe.

1670
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,780
Maybe I had one.

1671
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,780
Probably been at least 10 years since I've had a capri sun.

1672
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,780
It hasn't been that many for me.

1673
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:23,780
The last time I had one, I was struck by how small it is

1674
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,780
and how thin the straw is.

1675
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,780
Yeah, it's very small.

1676
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:32,780
I guess, yeah, it is very child size and child would not have so much of a problem.

1677
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:37,780
There's just not that much juice in there, actually.

1678
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,780
That's like, I feel that way about cereal boxes.

1679
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:46,780
Like a box of cereal, like a normal size box of cereal is like so small.

1680
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,780
It's like a couple of bowls for me.

1681
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,780
Yeah, yeah, the bowls keep getting bigger.

1682
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,780
Bowls keep getting bigger.

1683
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,780
I stay the same age.

1684
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:01,780
I don't know what that means.

1685
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,780
That's the opposite.

1686
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,780
I keep getting older.

1687
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,780
Bowls keep getting the same size.

1688
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,780
Bowls keep getting bigger, but I stay the same age.

1689
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,780
It means that during one year, the bowls just increased.

1690
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:21,780
They're just new bowls and they were bigger than the previous bowls.

1691
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,780
I'm just getting hungrier, I'm just getting hungrier all the time.

1692
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:28,780
So I'm pouring myself bigger and bigger bowls of honeycomb.

1693
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:35,780
The honeycomb is already big, but the bowl also has to be big as well to accommodate

1694
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:38,780
how many honeycomb I want to have in one sitting.

1695
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,780
It's a lot.

1696
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:41,780
It's a lot.

1697
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:45,780
I had, oh my god, I had a genius idea.

1698
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,780
I am a genius.

1699
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:51,780
I've been related to the current topic of conversation.

1700
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,780
Do you want to know my G?

1701
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:59,780
Wait, before we move over, here's a fun hypothetical.

1702
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:05,780
Would you rather eat a cereal that is very tiny, tiny and is like millions of them

1703
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:11,780
and you have a giant spoon that is like the size of a bowl in and of itself to eat from

1704
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:15,780
or would you like cereal that's large and bulbous like pieces

1705
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:22,780
but a tiny teaspoon that can't like lift even one of them without it falling off?

1706
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,780
Which one?

1707
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:33,780
I think in either scenario, you just eat it with your fucking hands.

1708
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:38,780
I guess the big bowl spoon with the small pieces

1709
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:43,780
because you can kind of just like drink it like a soup, I think.

1710
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,780
Small pieces?

1711
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:48,780
You said like the cereal is made of like tiny, tiny little bits, right?

1712
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,780
Yeah, tiny little like almost like sand.

1713
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:57,780
Yeah, well I think in that case you could just kind of drink it out of a big bowl spoon like a soup.

1714
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,780
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

1715
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:02,780
Versus like the tiny spoon with like a cereal is big.

1716
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:05,780
It's like, well that's just tedious.

1717
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,780
Yeah.

1718
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,780
Yeah, so I'm going to go with that one.

1719
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,780
No question.

1720
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,780
Comments down below?

1721
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:13,780
Tell us what you think.

1722
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,780
Big spoon, little cereal?

1723
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,780
Big cereal, little spoon.

1724
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,780
Only choose one.

1725
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,780
My genius idea.

1726
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,780
What were you thinking?

1727
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,780
My genius idea.

1728
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:28,780
As I mentioned, I have gotten back to progressing on the Slime and Punishment book.

1729
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,780
It's getting there.

1730
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:36,780
For the Vapors 2 Kickstarter, the stretch goal was the pin.

1731
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:40,780
Well, there were a few but there was the pins and then there was just money.

1732
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,780
Just everybody gets a dollar back.

1733
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,780
I still have my dollar somewhere.

1734
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,780
You still have the class war dollar?

1735
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,780
Yeah.

1736
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:48,780
Hell yeah.

1737
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:49,780
It's in my wallet.

1738
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:50,780
Hell yeah.

1739
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:59,780
I might do something like that again, but I was thinking instead of the pin, what if I included,

1740
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,780
what if I put a podron in?

1741
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,780
What if I gave everyone a podron?

1742
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:04,780
I could put a green crystal.

1743
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,780
Ooh.

1744
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,780
I could get a green crystal.

1745
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,780
Like a little 3D printed plastic green thing?

1746
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:13,780
No, I was thinking like an actual, you know, crystal stone.

1747
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,780
Like a real stone crystal?

1748
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,780
Yeah.

1749
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,780
Yeah, okay.

1750
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,780
Like some, um, uh, fluorite.

1751
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,780
Green fluorite is nice.

1752
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:25,780
Adventurine.

1753
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:31,780
Uh, I'd have to look into what looks good.

1754
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,780
But yeah, you could just buy some.

1755
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,780
I just give everyone a little po- crystal.

1756
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,780
That would be cute.

1757
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:40,780
I think that would be pretty cute.

1758
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,780
And then I have a second idea.

1759
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,780
Wait a minute.

1760
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,780
What if I, what if I gave everyone slime?

1761
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:46,780
What if I could give you some slime?

1762
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:50,780
What if I could make you, it's a little like, a little bottle of like candy.

1763
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:54,780
A little bottle of like, a little green, like candy slime.

1764
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,780
Make a pear flavor or something.

1765
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Holy shit.

1766
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,780
That's a lot of intricate work.

1767
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:05,780
So you'd have a tiny little plastic or glass bottle with like a cork stopper?

1768
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,780
Well, I think it would be screw on top.

1769
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,780
Screw on top.

1770
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:14,780
Well, I'm just thinking about the size of the thing and like, how many screw on tops

1771
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,780
are that big?

1772
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,780
Well, here's the thing.

1773
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,780
That's more, I mean.

1774
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:24,780
Well, I, well I buy flavorings in little glass bottles with screw on tops.

1775
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:29,780
So, I mean, I would just, I would just have to buy in bulk, you know, maybe a few hundred

1776
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,780
little, little glass or plastic bottles with screw on tops.

1777
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,780
And I'm sure that that's the thing I could get.

1778
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:40,780
And then filled with tiny little green, or not tiny, but like gummies of slime?

1779
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:50,780
No, I think if it was just, I would just make like a, a sort of like viscous green candy goo.

1780
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,780
Just put it in there.

1781
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:57,780
With a, with a little label on the, on the front that says corrosive or like danger slime.

1782
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,780
Yeah.

1783
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,780
Danger slime.

1784
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,780
Yeah.

1785
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:01,780
Danger slime.

1786
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,780
Yeah.

1787
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,780
Why not?

1788
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,780
Uh, I looked into it.

1789
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,780
I'd be, okay, the book is going to be big enough that like, I will not be able to send

1790
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,780
it like an envelope.

1791
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:17,780
Like I saved, I saved on postage with the vapors because it was thin enough that I could send

1792
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:20,780
it as an envelope as opposed to a package.

1793
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,780
The, this book will not be able to do that.

1794
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,780
So I might as well put it in a, in a box.

1795
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:30,780
And if I'm putting it in a box, like I might as well make use of the space that affords

1796
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:35,780
it to throw a bunch of extra shit in there, like rocks and bottles of slime.

1797
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:36,780
Fuck it.

1798
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:42,780
Uh, so maybe make those, that'd be a cool stretch goal, I think.

1799
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,780
Get real slime.

1800
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,780
So what would it be made of?

1801
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,780
Would it go off?

1802
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:49,780
No.

1803
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:55,780
Uh, I would use, um, it would just be, it would be the same thing as a gummy, basically.

1804
01:29:55,780 --> 01:30:04,780
Just, it would be like a corn syrup, sugar, water, acid solution, uh, with flavorings

1805
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,780
and colors.

1806
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:13,780
And, uh, I would, it would, potassium sorbate makes such things, uh, theoretically, infinitely

1807
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:15,780
shelf stable.

1808
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,780
So, no.

1809
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,780
I'm just wondering.

1810
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,780
Last forever.

1811
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:21,780
Last forever.

1812
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,780
It's meant as a food.

1813
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:24,780
Yeah.

1814
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:29,780
The customs might be, there might be some complications with all that.

1815
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,780
Internet, international maybe.

1816
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,780
I mean, I just-

1817
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:38,780
You could just say it's not a food on, when you write it down, but like, if people are

1818
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:43,780
to eat it, it should be, uh, it should be able to survive transit.

1819
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,780
Okay.

1820
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,780
Here, here are some thoughts.

1821
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,780
One, I could probably make it with nothing.

1822
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:54,780
Like, nobody, like nobody's allergic to like sugar, right?

1823
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:57,780
Uh, well, if you have ingredients on the back.

1824
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,780
Yeah.

1825
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:00,780
People can judge.

1826
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,780
Yeah.

1827
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:08,780
Um, so I might be able to make it something that is like, you know, basically there's no

1828
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:11,780
possible way anyone could have any kind of a reaction to it.

1829
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,780
There's no, nothing in it is, is allergenic at all.

1830
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:17,780
Um, I could just make it a non-edible.

1831
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:20,780
Like, it wouldn't have to be edible slime.

1832
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,780
Uh, if I, if I went with the slime idea.

1833
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:29,780
Um, I did do a quick Google to see if you are allowed to send liquids in the mail, and you

1834
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:34,780
are, uh, as long as they're in like, you know, a watertight container.

1835
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,780
Uh, although, yeah, internationally, you know, it's hard to say if there would be complications

1836
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,780
with that.

1837
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,780
Probably, it would be fine.

1838
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:48,780
I mean, Amazon must ship bottles of stuff in the mail.

1839
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,780
No, yeah.

1840
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,780
Other countries.

1841
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:54,780
It's, it's, it's just a matter of declaring what is in the box.

1842
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,780
Yeah.

1843
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,780
And it being true.

1844
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:02,780
And then when they open it to check, if they're like, I'm not sure about this or is this slime,

1845
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:06,780
this viscous, uh, edible liquid, they look at it.

1846
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,780
Yeah.

1847
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:12,780
And like, if they'll determine just randomly, depends on who's looking.

1848
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,780
Uh, whether or not they're going to seize the package or whether it's fine and they

1849
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:17,780
can go through.

1850
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:24,780
Uh, I didn't have, the only problems with customs that I had were like, because I declared

1851
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:30,780
that the value of the contents were what they were, it ended up being like expensive because

1852
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:37,780
I declared the value, which is a problem I can get around by just, just lying about how

1853
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,780
much cost.

1854
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:45,780
I think the idea of declaring the value is that you can get reimbursed if they lose your

1855
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:46,780
package.

1856
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:47,780
Yeah.

1857
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:50,780
But it's such a hassle to ask for that.

1858
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:51,780
Yeah.

1859
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,780
Oh man.

1860
01:32:54,780 --> 01:33:01,780
So I finally got, I mentioned before, I have some packages that were returned to my PO box.

1861
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:11,780
Um, well, I got, I finally got access to the Kickstarter backer report and I cannot find

1862
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,780
these names.

1863
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,780
I, I have looked through my Twitter DMs.

1864
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:20,780
I have looked through my PayPal records.

1865
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:22,500
Names of who?

1866
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:27,780
These are, um, the names of, I think it's two people that bought, uh, Pleven the Wee

1867
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:32,780
and two people that bought a Road to Radcon or, or I, or I thought that maybe they were

1868
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:38,780
like backers, like Kickstarter backers that had, that I owed a Road to Radcon book to

1869
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,780
or something like that.

1870
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,780
No, no, that wasn't, no, yeah, that was, was that a Kickstarter?

1871
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:45,780
Yeah.

1872
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,780
That was a Kickstarter.

1873
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,780
What, the Road to Radcon?

1874
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:48,780
Yes.

1875
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,780
That was a Kickstarter.

1876
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,780
That was like, that was a stretch goal.

1877
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,780
Yeah.

1878
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:52,780
Yeah.

1879
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,780
Yeah.

1880
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:58,780
It was, it was two, two blue, two blue rays and two of the Road to Radcon.

1881
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,780
So I thought I could find, because I have their names and I have their addresses, but

1882
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:03,780
they were returned to sender.

1883
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,780
So I thought these addresses must not be valid anymore.

1884
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,780
So I was going to go contact those people, but I couldn't find their contact info.

1885
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:13,780
Uh, and then I got access to the backer report and I can't find them.

1886
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,780
I looked up their names in the backer report and I can't find them.

1887
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:19,780
There's, they still elude me.

1888
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,780
Hmm.

1889
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,780
Yeah.

1890
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:30,780
So I, I, I'm no, I'm no closer to figuring it out, but it's a bit of a bummer.

1891
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:39,780
Uh, if I, if I, if it's, if it's, if it, if I just can't find anything, then I will probably

1892
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:45,780
just put them in the mail and send them again to their original location and just hope that

1893
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:49,780
they make it this time, because that's the only thing I can think of.

1894
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:50,780
I guess so.

1895
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:57,780
I mean, can you, you have like their name on the envelope, but you don't have what like

1896
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:03,780
username that corresponds to like, you don't know who you could ask on like discord or

1897
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,780
Twitter.

1898
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,780
I, I don't know.

1899
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:10,780
I don't, I lost that.

1900
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,780
Uh, yeah.

1901
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,780
I mean, you could dox them.

1902
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,780
You say, um, excuse me.

1903
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,780
Is anybody called this name?

1904
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:25,780
I looked through, like I looked through cause like, you know, they had to give me their

1905
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:33,780
address on either they had to DM me on Twitter or they had to include it in their PayPal order.

1906
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:37,780
So I looked through all my Twitter DMs and I looked through all my PayPal orders looking

1907
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:44,780
for these names or addresses and I came up completely empty and like, I, I wonder if

1908
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:50,780
I'm forgetting some, somewhere, but I can't think of anywhere else that like I would have

1909
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,780
gumroad.

1910
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,780
No, nobody, no, nobody bought.

1911
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,780
Oh wait, maybe.

1912
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:01,780
No, I think, I think I checked the DMs on the PCP account too.

1913
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:05,780
I think I checked the DMs.

1914
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,780
Did I?

1915
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,780
Maybe I should check double check the DMs on the PCP account cause it's a separate account

1916
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,780
with separate DMs.

1917
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:11,780
I don't know.

1918
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:16,780
That might be worth double checking.

1919
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:20,780
I just want everyone to get the shit they bought.

1920
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,780
Yeah.

1921
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:29,780
And, and, and also there are two people whose addresses I know three people, there's three

1922
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,780
people whose addresses I do have.

1923
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:33,780
I know where to send them.

1924
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:39,780
It's just that I don't want to make the trip to the post office until I can get until I

1925
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,780
have all of them and I can make one trip.

1926
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:46,380
So there are a couple that I could have sent but I haven't sent because I'm waiting until

1927
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:51,780
I find the other addresses so I can go all at once and it's been weeks and weeks.

1928
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:55,780
I can't fucking find these, these people.

1929
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:56,780
Yeah.

1930
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:57,780
So.

1931
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,780
Yeah.

1932
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:03,780
It's way too hot right now to just go outside.

1933
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:08,780
I, I need to send a Lord of Ghost or two.

1934
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,780
I will wait until winter.

1935
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:14,780
I just wait for a really long time.

1936
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,780
Yeah.

1937
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:28,540
I mean I, I can, I can, I can pop things in the, I guess, I guess in theory I could just

1938
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:33,780
post digit myself and put it in a mailbox instead of going all the way but I like to

1939
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:38,780
go to the post office because if it's international mail, I'm never confident that like I've

1940
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,780
postaged it right.

1941
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:43,780
I'd like to just give it to them and have them weigh it and have them tell me, okay,

1942
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,780
it's this much, just pay me with a credit card.

1943
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:54,780
This gives me a lot more confidence that I didn't fuck it up.

1944
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,780
I've been talking into the microphone.

1945
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,780
I feel like my, my voice is not being.

1946
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:01,780
No, you've been talking into a brick wall.

1947
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:07,780
I think maybe I'm, I've been sitting further away from the mic or not facing directly at

1948
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,780
it this week.

1949
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,780
So sorry, Eleazar.

1950
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:14,780
Maybe you got to maybe boost my levels or not.

1951
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,780
It's up to you.

1952
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:19,780
You might have to boost my levels as well because I think my microphone input is lower

1953
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,780
than I expected it to be, but I didn't want to change it halfway through.

1954
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:24,780
Yeah.

1955
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,780
I don't want to move.

1956
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,780
I don't want to move mine halfway through either.

1957
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:34,780
Uh, so I won't, uh, the, uh, yeah.

1958
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:37,780
I was thinking about, thinking about stretch goals again.

1959
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,780
Slime.

1960
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:39,780
Ha ha.

1961
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:40,780
Podrons.

1962
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:41,780
That seems really fun.

1963
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:47,780
I think that would be really fun because, because I've, I've, I'm already because I know

1964
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,780
postage is going to be expensive.

1965
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:52,780
Sending these packages is going to be expensive.

1966
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:56,780
I'm, I'm, so I might as well just go crazy with it.

1967
01:38:56,780 --> 01:39:02,780
If I'm going all in and sending like boxes, I might as well use that box space.

1968
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:10,780
So why not crystals and bottles and, uh, whatever the fuck.

1969
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,780
God, it's going to be, I kind of want it, but like shit, how much money could that be

1970
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,780
to, to, to cost?

1971
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,780
Um, hmm.

1972
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,780
How much am I going to have to pay for the whole package?

1973
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,780
I don't know how much the book is going to cost.

1974
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:33,780
I'm hoping that I can sell the book for like less than like $35, $30, but I don't know

1975
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,780
because I haven't like finalized it and send it to a printer yet.

1976
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,780
That's a lot.

1977
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,780
This is full color.

1978
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:43,780
It's like a million pages.

1979
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:44,780
Yeah.

1980
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:47,780
It's cause it's, it's going to be like 220 pages or something.

1981
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:54,780
And yeah, full, full color is like full color is really rough, man.

1982
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:59,780
I guess that's why with, when they, when people make comics, they have like an issue

1983
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:07,780
and it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a, just a couple of pages, one page.

1984
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,780
Yeah.

1985
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:14,780
And then when they sell manga volumes, uh, it's always in black and white.

1986
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:20,780
They never have a single bit of color on those cause there's so many pages and so many volumes.

1987
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:21,780
Yeah.

1988
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,780
Making real small.

1989
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,780
It's just, I think that's what I will do next time.

1990
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:30,780
If I make like a large thing, I'll try to make a manga volume of it.

1991
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,780
What do you mean?

1992
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:39,780
Like if I make a, like a Clarissa or, I don't want to do bell jade cause bell jade is in

1993
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:45,780
color, but like anything that's done black and white, I want to make, make a manga volume

1994
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,780
size of it.

1995
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:52,780
If it becomes long, like if I come up with like, oh lord of ghosts chapter act three and

1996
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,780
further adventures of lord of ghosts.

1997
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:59,780
You mean you wouldn't print one, you mean you would print one that's bigger than the

1998
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:00,780
one you already printed?

1999
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,780
No, no, I print it smaller.

2000
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,780
Like the, you know, manga volume size.

2001
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:09,780
I mean, that's like a couple hundred pages, right?

2002
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:13,780
No, no, no, like, like physical like height and width.

2003
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,780
Oh.

2004
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,780
Yeah.

2005
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,780
Like page size smaller.

2006
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,780
Page size smaller, but more pages.

2007
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,780
Yeah.

2008
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:23,780
It would be easier to, to, to send to people.

2009
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:25,780
And also it's cute.

2010
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,780
Yeah.

2011
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:27,780
I see.

2012
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:28,780
Yeah.

2013
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:34,780
No, I kind of, I kind of want, Slime and Punishment is going to be kind of a big book.

2014
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,780
Like the pages will be kind of big.

2015
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,780
It's in full color.

2016
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,780
So that's, that's expensive.

2017
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:48,780
So, you know, and then it might be kind of heavy.

2018
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:50,780
Dang.

2019
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:52,780
Postage might be.

2020
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,780
Bruh.

2021
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,780
I don't know.

2022
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:55,780
Postage.

2023
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:56,780
What was, what was Postage?

2024
01:41:56,780 --> 01:42:00,780
You're looking at a premium luxury good here.

2025
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,780
God.

2026
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:04,780
I mean, yeah, true.

2027
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:06,780
Let's see.

2028
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:10,780
USPS Postage Calculator.

2029
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:15,780
How much do you think like a, how much is a book cost?

2030
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:16,780
Or way rather.

2031
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:21,780
How much like a, like a, like a, like a kind of thick book, like a Homestuck volume.

2032
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:22,780
Homestuck volume.

2033
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,780
A pound?

2034
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:27,780
I don't know how much a pound is instinctively.

2035
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,780
Wait, wait, hold on.

2036
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,780
I'm going to weigh it.

2037
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:31,780
I'm going to weigh it.

2038
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,780
I don't know what, what a gram is instinctively either.

2039
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,780
You know what?

2040
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,780
I don't know.

2041
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,780
Freaking anything.

2042
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,780
Okay.

2043
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:41,780
Okay.

2044
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:48,780
I'm going to weigh this copy of secret in the basement by Ululilia.

2045
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,780
All right.

2046
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,780
I'll be right.

2047
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:51,780
I gotta go to the kitchen.

2048
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,780
Okay.

2049
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,780
Let me Google secret in the basement.

2050
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:59,780
Secret in the basement.

2051
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:04,780
I don't know how to spell it.

2052
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,780
Ow.

2053
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,780
Okay.

2054
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:10,780
It was 27 ounces.

2055
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:19,780
And a, a pound is, is 32 ounces, right?

2056
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:23,780
Trying to find an image of the secret of the basement as a physical thing because I don't

2057
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:27,780
can't imagine the size of it.

2058
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:30,780
It is fairly thick, but at the pages are smaller.

2059
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:36,780
So I figure it would like actually probably this is underestimating the weight because

2060
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:42,780
these are going to, because it has like, you know, regular white tech, black text on white

2061
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:49,780
page, interior pages, whereas slime and punishment will have, you know, like color printed pages.

2062
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:51,780
So it'll probably heavier.

2063
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:52,780
What, what thickness?

2064
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,780
Do you know the thickness of the pages?

2065
01:43:54,780 --> 01:44:02,780
Uh, I, I don't have a bunch of pages changing the thickness by like a micrometer or whatever

2066
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:07,780
is like going to do a lot to change the weight.

2067
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:10,780
That's true.

2068
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:11,780
Yeah.

2069
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,780
I mean, I want them to be sturdy.

2070
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:14,780
Yeah.

2071
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:21,780
I mean, don't, don't have like flimsy, but like as small as is reasonable.

2072
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,780
You should go for.

2073
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:26,780
No, I do not want a flat rate box.

2074
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,780
You sick buck.

2075
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:34,780
If you want, you can go to like a craft store and check out the pages, the paper they sell

2076
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:38,780
and they might have like, like descriptions of what the thicknesses are.

2077
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:44,780
Oh, you know, I ordered a sample of some, not from Mixam, but from some other printing company.

2078
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:51,780
So I do have like a little box of like sample papers with like number, you know, like paper

2079
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,780
weights on them.

2080
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:55,780
I don't, yeah.

2081
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,780
I'm just, okay.

2082
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:03,780
Then to the United Kingdom, the value of the item being made.

2083
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,780
All right.

2084
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:07,780
Let's just pretend it costs nothing.

2085
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:10,780
Calculate based on size and shape.

2086
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:11,780
All right.

2087
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:14,780
We'll say it's a package.

2088
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:17,780
I'm going to say it costs, let's say it's three pounds.

2089
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,780
We're going to overestimate.

2090
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:20,780
Yeah.

2091
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,780
Three pounds.

2092
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,780
Like the, the podron and all the other stuff in there.

2093
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:27,780
How much is this going to cost?

2094
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,780
Oh my God.

2095
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:32,780
Oh no.

2096
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,780
Is it like 400 pounds?

2097
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:36,780
It's $42.

2098
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:37,780
It's what?

2099
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:39,780
$42.

2100
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,780
To send it?

2101
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:46,780
To send a first-class international package that weighs three pounds to the UK.

2102
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,780
That's just the, this postage.

2103
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:49,780
That's just for the postage.

2104
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:52,780
The cost of, of the, the book and everything.

2105
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,780
That's bad.

2106
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:56,780
That's really bad.

2107
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:57,780
Yeah.

2108
01:45:57,780 --> 01:45:58,780
I mean.

2109
01:45:58,780 --> 01:45:59,780
Okay.

2110
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,780
You're going to have less people saying, yes, I can afford that.

2111
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:04,780
I mean, yeah.

2112
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,780
Hmm.

2113
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:07,780
Hmm.

2114
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,780
That's something to think about.

2115
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:18,780
Well, how, like approximately how heavy is the book going to be?

2116
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:21,780
Because three pounds may be too much of an overestimate.

2117
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:25,780
It'll probably be between two and three.

2118
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:26,780
Okay.

2119
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,780
What does it say for two?

2120
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,780
Is it basically the same?

2121
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:35,780
Let's see.

2122
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,780
Two pounds is, um, $27.

2123
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:41,780
I mean.

2124
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:42,780
That's a lot.

2125
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,780
It's better.

2126
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:45,780
Actually, no, it's not that much different.

2127
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,780
It's almost 30.

2128
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:48,780
Yeah.

2129
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:49,780
Yeah.

2130
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,780
I mean.

2131
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,780
Well, let's see.

2132
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:54,780
One, one pound.

2133
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,780
I'm going to bet it's going to be like $16 or something.

2134
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:00,780
Wait.

2135
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,780
One pound is also $27.

2136
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:06,780
Oh, then go heavier.

2137
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Well, let's see how much is, is four pounds then.

2138
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,780
Four pounds is $57.

2139
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:17,780
So I guess there's a minimum.

2140
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:19,780
I guess.

2141
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:21,780
I mean, yeah, it's, it's a package.

2142
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:24,780
So it takes up physical space, whether or not it weighs too much.

2143
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:28,780
20 is $27.

2144
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:35,780
Just the, the, the total minimum, uh, they let it cost to send any package to the UK.

2145
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:40,780
From whatever surface you're using, I guess so.

2146
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,780
I'm just using the USPS.

2147
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:48,780
Uh, yeah, even if it only weighs 10 ounces, it's still $27.

2148
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,780
Dang, really?

2149
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:51,780
I was sending, actually, no.

2150
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:56,780
I was sending the letters, the large letters to America for like eight pounds.

2151
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,780
I mean, yeah, 11 letters.

2152
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:06,780
I was sending things as large envelopes, which is a lot less than this.

2153
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:18,780
But sending the, the, the packages with the, the Lord of Ghost plush in and I was only like, like 12 to $15 on this thing I was using.

2154
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:21,780
Let me check.

2155
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,780
Let me see how much does it cost to send one to Chile?

2156
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,780
Wait, what?

2157
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,780
It didn't even ask me.

2158
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:33,780
Okay.

2159
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:35,780
Calculate based on size and shape.

2160
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:41,780
Let's give us, okay, three pounds, three pound package to Chile.

2161
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,780
Again, $42.

2162
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:51,780
Is it, is it same if I go for two, $26 for two pounds?

2163
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,780
Yeah.

2164
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:58,780
Um, all right.

2165
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,780
Well, I mean, that's, that's troubling.

2166
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,780
That's troubling.

2167
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:06,780
Hmm.

2168
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:12,780
Maybe a stretch goal could be like no mailing fees.

2169
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:25,780
I, I mean, that would be, hold on, let me, let me check.

2170
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:29,780
Last thing I want to check is how much does it cost to send like in like domestically?

2171
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:30,780
Like what's the difference?

2172
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:34,780
It probably be quite a lot less.

2173
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,780
I'm sure it will be more than half.

2174
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:44,780
I think something like 20 or 25% of people that bought my shit are like international.

2175
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:46,780
So like most of them were in the US.

2176
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:53,780
So from my zip code to any other fucking zip code.

2177
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:56,780
And let's see.

2178
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:57,780
Okay.

2179
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:02,780
Let's say three pounds, three pound package inside the US.

2180
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:06,780
Okay.

2181
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,780
Damn.

2182
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:16,780
It's still $18 to send it inside the US.

2183
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:17,780
Okay.

2184
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,780
Now, now this is tricky.

2185
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:30,780
Media mail, media mail would only cost $4.80 for a package for a package.

2186
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:32,780
Okay.

2187
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:38,780
The rules of media mail are you have to, it has to be like media, like it has to be

2188
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:42,780
books or like, I mean, digital media is okay too.

2189
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,780
DVDs and CDs are okay.

2190
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:51,780
So I could do it for cheap if it was books.

2191
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:56,780
Technically, I would not be allowed to send it if it's got anything else in there.

2192
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:02,780
So the slime and the podrans would be, it would just be a question of can I get away with it?

2193
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,780
Which is questionable.

2194
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,780
Yeah.

2195
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:15,780
But I mean, that's a difference between $4.80 versus $17.90.

2196
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:20,780
Even domestically, that's infuriating.

2197
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:26,780
I mean, you should definitely use that for anyone who just gets the book.

2198
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:28,780
Oh, yeah.

2199
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:31,780
Could you not talk to them and ask them?

2200
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:35,780
It's technically part of the book thing.

2201
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:39,780
It's like you get the book and you get the little things that come with the book.

2202
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:43,780
Does it not count as like, oh, it's like a collector's edition of a thing.

2203
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,780
It's media.

2204
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:46,780
I think.

2205
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,780
It's part of the media.

2206
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:57,780
I'm pretty sure that by the letter of the rules, it's like, no, you're not supposed to have anything but books in there.

2207
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:06,780
On the other, I mean, the Blu-rays, they had a case, but the case doesn't count against that rule.

2208
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:20,780
So I feel like if questioned, most officials would probably say, okay, crystals and bottles do not count.

2209
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,780
Do not meet the media mail criteria.

2210
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:33,780
Well, is it cheaper then to send crystals and bottles by themselves and the book by itself?

2211
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:41,780
Well, I don't know because there's because then the crystals and bottles, they would still have to go in a package.

2212
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:45,780
And the package still has, you know, these minimum weight requirements.

2213
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:52,780
So it still would cost $27 just to send like a tiny little box.

2214
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,780
That sucks.

2215
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:59,780
That sucks so bad.

2216
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:00,780
How can that be?

2217
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:10,780
How can it cost $27 to send any package of any, even the smallest imaginable package from the United States to the UK?

2218
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,780
Let's fucked up.

2219
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:15,780
It's a system.

2220
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,780
It got worse during COVID, for sure.

2221
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:20,780
Yeah.

2222
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:29,780
Maybe it's less expensive to just drive to people's houses and give it to them.

2223
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:32,780
You know, cross country tour.

2224
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:37,780
Like Santa Claus going around the world, dropping it down people's chimneys.

2225
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,780
Yeah.

2226
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,780
Slime drops.

2227
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,780
Okay, I mean.

2228
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:58,780
You should do like a secret, you should do like a slime drop where like you take a picture of like a bunch of slime and punishments and in a secret place and people online have to figure out where they are and find the treasure.

2229
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:05,780
Media mail and library mail are not sealed against postal inspection.

2230
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:14,780
Regardless of physical closure, the mailing of articles at media mail or media library mail prices constitutes consent by the mail or to postal inspection of the contents.

2231
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:18,780
Mailable matter meeting one of the specific eligibility standards.

2232
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:20,780
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

2233
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:33,780
Yeah, only these items may be mailed at the media mail prices books, including books issued to supplement other books of at least eight printed pages, blah, blah, blah, films, music.

2234
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:41,780
So, I mean, computer readable media, enclosures in books mailed as media mail.

2235
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,780
What about library mail?

2236
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,780
No.

2237
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,780
Okay, so no.

2238
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:53,780
I mean, you can read the label on the front of the slime bottle.

2239
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,780
Yeah, you're right.

2240
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:05,780
You know, technically, the bottle is just a vessel for the label, which is readable material, as are the contents of the bottle.

2241
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:12,780
That's just a medium to prop prop propel the message of the of the label.

2242
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:19,780
You can put like, like alphabet gummies in the slime, and it would be a readable slime.

2243
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:23,780
Now I like where your head's at.

2244
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:29,780
If I if I make enough letters that could fill at least eight pages.

2245
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:38,780
And you get like a tiny little chisel, and you chisel like words like Rosetta's zone into the podron.

2246
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,780
So that's all like material.

2247
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:44,780
Like like type like writing the entire Bible on a grain of rice.

2248
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:46,780
Yeah.

2249
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,780
Oh, yeah.

2250
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:52,780
Oh, yeah, now we're talking.

2251
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:55,780
I have to pee again somehow.

2252
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:59,780
I'll be I just gotta gotta get out of here.

2253
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:03,780
Splash.

2254
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:08,780
So I watched a video this week.

2255
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:12,780
I watched the new Patricia Taksin video.

2256
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:14,780
You know her?

2257
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,780
No, she is a music person.

2258
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:23,780
She also does some film stuff.

2259
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,780
I don't know, whatever.

2260
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:27,780
She's made video essays sometimes.

2261
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:36,780
She does music, but she she made one recently and oh, she did a big video about marble madness a while ago.

2262
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:37,780
That was really good.

2263
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,780
And I liked it.

2264
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,780
This one was about.

2265
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:46,780
There's not a bunch of stuff, but it was it talked about these two songs.

2266
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:53,780
They were like these horror parodies of like like pop songs.

2267
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:55,780
One was shit.

2268
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:56,780
What were they called?

2269
01:56:56,780 --> 01:57:01,780
One was called the boys are back in town parentheses to kill you.

2270
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:02,780
And the other one was.

2271
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:04,780
I don't know.

2272
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:07,780
It was about it was the parody of that one.

2273
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:15,780
Kiss me, need the American twilight kiss me out on the moonlit floor.

2274
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,780
That one.

2275
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:18,780
I don't know that one.

2276
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,780
You don't know that one.

2277
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:22,780
I don't know that one.

2278
01:57:23,780 --> 01:57:24,780
You don't know that one.

2279
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:36,780
That's a good song.

2280
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,780
Anyway, and I would have it stuck in my head.

2281
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:44,780
I had just just the snippets, just the snippets that she played of this parody version.

2282
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:50,780
Because there's a it's not it's not just the song with different lyrics.

2283
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:55,780
There's like there's pitch shifted parts that like change the harmony up.

2284
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:01,780
She played a little bit of like the climax, the song climaxes.

2285
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:07,780
The whole thing is sort of like a Lovecraft like horror, like a transformation is taking place.

2286
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:11,780
And then the final verse is like, you know, she's become a demon or whatever.

2287
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:14,780
She's become a horror beyond comprehension.

2288
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,780
Sounded great.

2289
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:17,780
It didn't even listen to the song.

2290
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:21,780
Just heard like four little like 10 second snippets of it.

2291
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,780
But I just have those in my head.

2292
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:30,780
And so maybe I should go listen to the song, but no, I don't want to do that.

2293
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:33,780
I don't know why I don't want to do that.

2294
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:40,780
I just don't feel like that's too much effort to click on something to sit down and click on something and then be expected to sit there while it happens.

2295
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:43,780
Yeah. What if I what if I don't enjoy it?

2296
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:48,780
What if I what if I what if I sit there and I feel stupid listening to a song that's not even that good?

2297
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:50,780
What if what if she oversold it?

2298
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:54,780
What if I want to click away, but how how rude it would be.

2299
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:58,780
But that would be but that would be even more effort clicking away.

2300
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,780
Where does it end?

2301
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,780
Snowballs.

2302
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:10,780
You understand the only winning move is not to click.

2303
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,780
Turn that computer off.

2304
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:15,780
But I have to turn it off.

2305
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:18,780
I've already turned on my computer.

2306
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:20,780
I can't like turn it off.

2307
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:22,780
I can't like leave.

2308
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:24,780
Can't stop reading.

2309
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,780
Now that I'm logged on, I can't stop posting once I've begun.

2310
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:34,780
I don't know.

2311
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,780
It was a good video.

2312
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:38,780
Just wanted to say I watched the video and it was good.

2313
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:41,780
Dude, I've watched a video, but it was bad.

2314
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:43,780
Oh, nice.

2315
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,780
That's just as that's just as good in its own way.

2316
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:49,780
Even bad videos can be good videos.

2317
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:51,780
No, they can't.

2318
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:53,780
That's why they're bad.

2319
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:55,780
Oh, yeah.

2320
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,780
You're right.

2321
01:59:57,780 --> 01:59:58,780
Makes perfect sense.

2322
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,780
I got a pain in my side.

2323
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,780
I keep thinking.

2324
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,780
Oh, is it a kidney stone?

2325
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,780
It hasn't been yet.

2326
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:10,780
And I hope it won't be.

2327
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:12,780
It's a liver stone.

2328
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:16,780
I don't know if those happen.

2329
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:19,780
It's an intestine stone.

2330
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:23,780
It's a lung stone.

2331
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,780
God, imagine.

2332
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:29,780
Cuffing up like granite like gravel.

2333
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:30,780
Oh, you mentioned.

2334
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:35,780
I don't think I you mentioned the thing about the muscle in your neck.

2335
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:36,780
Neck, chin, feeling.

2336
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:37,780
Yeah.

2337
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:40,780
Engorged or whatever fucking crazy shit you were saying.

2338
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:43,780
It's not like it's like a frog that's gone.

2339
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,780
You know, like stretching it all out.

2340
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:53,780
I feel sore in the muscles of the sides of the front of my neck.

2341
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:57,780
It's not it's like a sore throat, but it's not the inside of my throat.

2342
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:02,780
I'm sore in the muscles that like are on the sides of my chin.

2343
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:06,780
Kind of the muscles that like, you know, when you look in the mirror and you

2344
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:10,780
like grimace really hard and like you make the cords like the cord muscles

2345
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,780
like stand out on the sides of your neck.

2346
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:15,780
You know what I'm talking like those muscles are sore and I don't know why.

2347
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:18,780
I don't they've been sore for like three days.

2348
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:22,780
Are they you mean like the smile muscles?

2349
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:24,780
No, no smiling too much.

2350
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:28,780
Like, you know, you put your hand on the side of your neck and you like tense

2351
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,780
your muscles in your face up.

2352
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:33,780
You screw your face up and it's, you know, the cords in your neck.

2353
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:35,780
Oh, the right of the sides.

2354
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,780
Yeah, the like archery part.

2355
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:38,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2356
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:40,780
But it's like the part just under my chin.

2357
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:42,780
It's just sore.

2358
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:43,780
It's sore like I overused it.

2359
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:44,780
I don't know what is it.

2360
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:45,780
I have a couple of theories.

2361
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:49,780
I think it might be that I was like chewing too hard.

2362
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:53,780
I might have made some like the gummies I made might have come out too chewy

2363
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,780
and I just tried to chew them and I made my jaw.

2364
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:57,780
I tired my jaw out.

2365
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:01,780
Now my face muscles are sore in a way that they are not used to being.

2366
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:04,780
I mean, it sounds like it is probably that.

2367
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:07,780
But they've been sore for like shit been sore for like three days.

2368
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:08,780
It's crazy.

2369
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,780
I don't know.

2370
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:10,780
It's weird.

2371
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:14,780
The human skull is a strange guy.

2372
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:16,780
It's a soreness that I've never had before.

2373
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:21,780
I've never been restrained these particular muscles in this way before.

2374
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:26,780
Maybe you make it like an extremely strained, angry expression when scrolling through Twitter.

2375
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:29,780
You know I do.

2376
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:31,780
You know I do.

2377
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:34,780
That's as good a theory as any.

2378
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:37,780
That's the seethe muscle is what that is.

2379
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:40,780
Found it.

2380
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:41,780
I've been working it out.

2381
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:48,780
You could tell when somebody uses Twitter and they see you the whole time.

2382
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:51,780
But they're huge bulging whatever the muscle that is.

2383
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:54,780
They've got to put your hands on their necks.

2384
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,780
They've got to put their hands in their necks.

2385
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,780
Oh, have you been seething lately?

2386
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,780
Oh, wow.

2387
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:03,780
You can really tell.

2388
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:12,780
What's that song called?

2389
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:18,780
Kiss Me Out on the Moonlit Floor.

2390
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:24,780
It's called Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer.

2391
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,780
Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer.

2392
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,780
There it is.

2393
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:29,780
Let me look at it.

2394
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:36,780
That's the song that seems ubiquitous.

2395
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:40,780
Oh, I have heard this one.

2396
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:47,780
I was thinking for a second that it was like some American pop song that didn't come over to the UK, but I have heard this.

2397
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:49,780
Maybe I just...

2398
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:52,780
Maybe I didn't hum it accurately enough.

2399
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,780
It's an earworm.

2400
02:03:58,780 --> 02:03:59,780
It's an earworm.

2401
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:01,780
It's a mere worm.

2402
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:04,780
A mere worm of a wretched insect.

2403
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:06,780
A hive of scum and villainy.

2404
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:12,780
Well, are we done for topics?

2405
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:15,780
I guess we're done for topics, yeah.

2406
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:18,780
Epic.

2407
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:20,780
You want to do voicemails?

2408
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:21,780
Let's do voicemail.

2409
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:25,780
Okay, we're on it.

2410
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:33,780
First one is called Give Ben St. Page 2.

2411
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:34,780
You see in this shit?

2412
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,780
You see in this shit?

2413
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:40,780
Is it the image or link in the next thing?

2414
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,780
I've seen this shit.

2415
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:45,780
No, no, no, no, no.

2416
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:46,780
I didn't...

2417
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,780
I mean, the one called Give Ben...

2418
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:50,780
Yeah, Give Ben Page St. 2.

2419
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:52,780
I'm listening to it. 3, 2, 1.

2420
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:53,780
There's only one second.

2421
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,780
Is there...

2422
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:56,780
Come on.

2423
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:57,780
Come on, play.

2424
02:04:58,780 --> 02:04:59,780
Is there anything in it?

2425
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,780
It's one second.

2426
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:03,780
What?

2427
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:07,780
The second voicemail is...

2428
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:10,780
They said, oh, I forgot to link in the last one at oops.com.

2429
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:13,780
So I think they meant to put a link to an image.

2430
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:15,780
Fine.

2431
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,780
All right, I'll post it here in general, I guess.

2432
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,780
Yeah.

2433
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:21,780
Oh, I know who drew this, I think.

2434
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,780
Yeah.

2435
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:26,780
Vaping is not a crime unless you do it without me.

2436
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:28,780
Ben St., Internet Cloud Chaser, Twitter user,

2437
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:32,780
Crystorian, Vapor, Comic Book Maker, and more.

2438
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:34,780
Ben St.

2439
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:35,780
Ben St.

2440
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:36,780
You poopin'.

2441
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:37,780
Over here.

2442
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:39,780
Over here, I finally arrived.

2443
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:41,780
Come and give me an American pat on the butt.

2444
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,780
That's the only kind I know how to give.

2445
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:48,780
Ain't I a stinker?

2446
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,780
Laugh track applause.

2447
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:53,780
The crowd's whooping for sure.

2448
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:56,780
Hey, Ellie, is our play a can laugh track please and thank you.

2449
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:58,780
Okay, I hope you did.

2450
02:05:58,780 --> 02:05:59,780
I like these poses.

2451
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,780
This is exactly how it was like.

2452
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:04,780
Oh, this is you coming to America.

2453
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,780
Oh, great, great.

2454
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,780
I forgot that that happened.

2455
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,780
It's been so many years.

2456
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,780
It has been.

2457
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:13,780
Well, so you forgot the thing you said in that page.

2458
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,780
What did I say?

2459
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:16,780
You said give and take.

2460
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:19,780
Why would you yell that at me across an airport?

2461
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:22,780
Oh, oh, uh, yeah.

2462
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:23,780
Give and take.

2463
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:26,780
Why would you yell that at me across an airport?

2464
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:27,780
Okay, yeah.

2465
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:28,780
Ain't I a stinker?

2466
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:29,780
It got covered up.

2467
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:30,780
So I fucked it up.

2468
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:37,780
And then you will respect my authority.

2469
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:40,780
I'll read it like Cartman from the South Park.

2470
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:44,780
Oh, that hurt my throat on the inside.

2471
02:06:44,780 --> 02:06:48,780
Oh, wait, this is close up with clarity.

2472
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,780
Okay.

2473
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:52,780
Wait, so the same scene from a different.

2474
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:55,780
No, it's the same part of the page but zoomed in.

2475
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:56,780
It's just at the end.

2476
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:00,780
It's a little hard to tell what it was not.

2477
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,780
I don't think it really needed a close up.

2478
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:05,780
Like I got the picture the first time.

2479
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:07,780
But yeah, this is great.

2480
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:08,780
That's cute.

2481
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:09,780
Thank you.

2482
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,780
I know who drew this.

2483
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:11,780
Thank you.

2484
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,780
Very, very good.

2485
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:13,780
Very nice.

2486
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,780
I like my head.

2487
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:16,780
I like my face.

2488
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:21,780
Is this a reference to that picture of me squatting next to the

2489
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,780
fire hydrant pointing at the sticker that says vaping is not a

2490
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:25,780
crime?

2491
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:27,780
Because if so, that's a deep cut.

2492
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:32,780
All right.

2493
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:35,780
Next voicemail is called Ben.

2494
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:39,780
You are genuinely funny and entertaining to listen to low.

2495
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,780
Okay.

2496
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:43,780
Thanks.

2497
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:44,780
Appreciate it.

2498
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:48,780
Next one is called Joe Flambeau Prandon McJason.

2499
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,780
Three, two, one go.

2500
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:51,780
Ben St.

2501
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:53,780
Have you ever eaten a nectarine?

2502
02:07:53,780 --> 02:07:54,780
Yeah.

2503
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:56,780
Okay.

2504
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:58,780
Next one.

2505
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:00,780
They're not that weird.

2506
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,780
They're not that weird.

2507
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:06,780
They're very similar to a peach, but not as fuzzy and maybe a little

2508
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:07,780
tangier.

2509
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:08,780
Yeah.

2510
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:09,780
Yeah.

2511
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:10,780
Not had them.

2512
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:11,780
Oh, wait.

2513
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,780
I was thinking of tangerine.

2514
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:14,780
Oh, no.

2515
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:15,780
God.

2516
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:16,780
Oh, God.

2517
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:17,780
No.

2518
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:19,780
So have you ever had an nectarine?

2519
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,780
I guess not.

2520
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:23,780
Oh, well, wow.

2521
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:24,780
How embarrassing for you.

2522
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,780
No.

2523
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:27,780
You really put your foot in your mouth on that one.

2524
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,780
I guess I'm just not that fruity, Ben.

2525
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:34,780
Turn it around on me.

2526
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:36,780
They're good.

2527
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:37,780
They're good.

2528
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:42,780
Next one is called for Ben, your daddy at utoronto.ca.

2529
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:43,780
Okay.

2530
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:45,780
Three, two, one go.

2531
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:49,780
Up yours, woke moralist.

2532
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,780
We'll see who cancels who.

2533
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:52,780
We will.

2534
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:57,780
That was a fun Jordan Peterson moment.

2535
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:01,780
Did you watch the whole video of that?

2536
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:03,780
I did not watch the whole video of it.

2537
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:07,780
There's some other parts that are equally, if not more funny than

2538
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:09,780
what he said there.

2539
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,780
Um, was it the part?

2540
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:12,780
He's just.

2541
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:13,780
What rules?

2542
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,780
Precisely.

2543
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:16,780
What rules did I violate?

2544
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:17,780
I saw that one.

2545
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,780
Yeah.

2546
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:19,780
I'm sure there's more to it.

2547
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:24,780
It's just like he's going insane with rage, but like presenting

2548
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:28,780
because he got banned on Twitter, but he's presenting himself as like,

2549
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:31,780
you know, put on a little monkey suit and screech about it.

2550
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:35,780
A double camera like like interview is just, he's just raging.

2551
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:37,780
It's so insane.

2552
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,780
Yeah.

2553
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:46,780
I honestly, I didn't really get it, but like, I mean, I didn't really think

2554
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:47,780
it was funny.

2555
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,780
I just found it confusing.

2556
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:52,780
But then the more I saw people memeing on it, I, I found it funnier

2557
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:59,780
and funnier until, you know, the, the Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

2558
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:01,780
memes have been pretty good.

2559
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:03,780
I've been seeing those the last couple of days.

2560
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:04,780
Oh yeah.

2561
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:06,780
You know, yeah.

2562
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:07,780
Pretty, pretty good meme.

2563
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:08,780
Pretty good.

2564
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:11,780
Up yours.

2565
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:12,780
Like who says that?

2566
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,780
Up yours, woke moralists.

2567
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:16,780
I've heard, I've heard people say that.

2568
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:22,780
Yeah, but it's just such a tame thing to say.

2569
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:23,780
Up yours.

2570
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:26,780
Yeah, but that's, I mean, that's the kind of guy he is.

2571
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:31,780
It makes sense.

2572
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:33,780
Can't believe you're defending Jordan Peterson.

2573
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:37,780
I'm just saying it's, that's what I would expect him to say.

2574
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,780
Yeah.

2575
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:42,780
I feel up yours is more of like a British thing.

2576
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:44,780
Like I've, I've heard that in my life.

2577
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,780
I've heard it.

2578
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,780
I've heard it here.

2579
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:49,780
It's not a, it's not that weird.

2580
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:51,780
Up your ass.

2581
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:57,780
I'll tell you where to, you can, I'll tell you what you can do where you can stick that,

2582
02:10:57,780 --> 02:10:59,780
stick that in your pipe and smoke it.

2583
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:00,780
You,

2584
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:03,780
Stick that in where the sun don't shine.

2585
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:08,780
Why don't you, you can, why don't you, you,

2586
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:11,780
Why don't you, open your anus for me, huh?

2587
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:12,780
Yeah.

2588
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:13,780
Yeah.

2589
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:14,780
Why won't, why won't you do that?

2590
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,780
Why?

2591
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:16,780
Why?

2592
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,780
Okay.

2593
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:22,780
Okay.

2594
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:23,780
All right.

2595
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:24,780
All right.

2596
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,780
Next one is called Happy Birthday Ben You Basterd.

2597
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:27,780
Three, two, one, go.

2598
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,780
Okay.

2599
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:34,780
Next one's called Rejoice, Ben's Birthday.

2600
02:11:34,780 --> 02:11:36,780
Three, two, one, go.

2601
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:44,780
I would say that Ben Saint is kind of like the closest thing we have to Jesus these days.

2602
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:48,780
Kind of became Irish at the end there.

2603
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,780
Jesus?

2604
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:51,780
I would agree.

2605
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,780
I would agree with that.

2606
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:54,780
Yeah.

2607
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:55,780
Let me get my cross.

2608
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:59,780
I knew it would end this way.

2609
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,780
Knew it would end this way.

2610
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:05,780
Next one is called Son of a Glitch.

2611
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,780
Oh, it's a Vokeroo.

2612
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:08,780
Three, two, one, go.

2613
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:11,780
My favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.

2614
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:14,780
Welcome to Son of a Glitch.

2615
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:16,780
Today we're going to be talking about...

2616
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:19,780
Mega Man X.

2617
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:21,780
My friends for the DS.

2618
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:27,780
It's like the original Mega Man X, but on the DS and there's some changes.

2619
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:30,780
For example, the UI has one extra pixel on the side.

2620
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,780
I thought that was interesting.

2621
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:34,780
Yeah, and it was.

2622
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:35,780
What's your point?

2623
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:36,780
You making fun of me?

2624
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:38,780
Yes.

2625
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:42,780
Oh, well, okay.

2626
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:44,780
Yeah, I thought so.

2627
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:47,780
Mega Maniac.

2628
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,780
That's what you are.

2629
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:51,780
What do I have?

2630
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:57,780
I have played Mega Man's 1 through 8.

2631
02:12:57,780 --> 02:13:02,780
I have played Mega Man's Wiley's Revenge through V.

2632
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:06,780
I have played Mega Man X through X6.

2633
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:09,780
I have played...

2634
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,780
I briefly played Mega Man's Soccer.

2635
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:15,780
It was a nightmare.

2636
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:17,780
I think...

2637
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:18,780
I mean, I played...

2638
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:23,780
I mean, not recently, but at some point in the past, I played 0 through 04.

2639
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:25,780
So I guess I'll count those.

2640
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:27,780
So I have...

2641
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:29,780
Well, no.

2642
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:36,780
Recently, I have played 8 plus 5 plus 6 is 19.

2643
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:39,780
I've played 19 Mega Man games.

2644
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:41,780
Damn.

2645
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:48,780
And I've only got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

2646
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:50,780
I've only got 13 left.

2647
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:57,780
15 if I count Power Battle and Power Fighters, which I do.

2648
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,780
So it's 15.

2649
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:03,780
Is Mega Man 64 just by itself?

2650
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:05,780
Are there any other in that series?

2651
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:08,780
Yeah.

2652
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:13,780
Or Mega Man 64, aka Mega Man Legends on the PlayStation,

2653
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:20,780
aka Rockman Dash, aka Dig Outer's Adventure Story in Halcyon Days.

2654
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:21,780
Oh my God.

2655
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:24,780
Yeah, there's two of them.

2656
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:27,780
I had forgotten about those.

2657
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:30,780
Lemau.

2658
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:33,780
I guess that I'm going for...

2659
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:37,780
I mean, if I really wanted to say I played every Mega Man game,

2660
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:44,780
then I would have to play all the Battle Network and Star Force, I think?

2661
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:46,780
No.

2662
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:50,780
Yeah, the DS things and the...

2663
02:14:50,780 --> 02:14:51,780
You know what those are?

2664
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:56,780
I don't know what they are, but I know I've seen screenshots of some sort of a DS Mega Man game

2665
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:59,780
that takes place in the internet or something.

2666
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,780
That's correct.

2667
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:02,780
Yeah.

2668
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:05,780
Yeah, it's completely different.

2669
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:12,780
It's like a tactical RPG turn-based grid battle kind of thing.

2670
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:14,780
So it's completely different.

2671
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,780
And then that's Battle Network.

2672
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:18,780
And then Star Force is...

2673
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:24,780
It's a post-time-jump version of that in space.

2674
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:27,780
They go to space.

2675
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,780
Okay.

2676
02:15:30,780 --> 02:15:31,780
On the internet.

2677
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,780
Oh, the space internet.

2678
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,780
Wait, hang on.

2679
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:37,780
Let me read you something.

2680
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:39,780
Let me read you something.

2681
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:43,780
This might...

2682
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:46,780
Eleazar edit this part out because I gotta find it.

2683
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:49,780
It might take me like 30 seconds.

2684
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:50,780
Yeah, okay.

2685
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,780
Here we go.

2686
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:55,780
If you're curious about the protagonist of Mega Man Star Force,

2687
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:58,780
his name is Star Force Mega Man.

2688
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:01,780
And here's what the Mega Man wiki has to say about him.

2689
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:06,780
Star Force Mega Man, known as Shooting Star Rock Man in Japan,

2690
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:14,780
is the EM wave change of the human Geostelar and the Amian Omega Geese.

2691
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:15,780
Huh?

2692
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:21,780
So I hope that explains to you.

2693
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:23,780
Well, I'll continue.

2694
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:28,780
In Mega Man Star Force III, he is registered under Project TC as number 003.

2695
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:32,780
His appearance is also changed after Geo obtained the Hunter VG

2696
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:35,780
and Omega Geese is converted into a wizard.

2697
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:36,780
Oh, the wizard.

2698
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:37,780
Now I get it.

2699
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:39,780
So now you know.

2700
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:44,780
I hope that clarified things for me.

2701
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,780
Good stuff.

2702
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:48,780
So I don't know what's going on with those.

2703
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,780
I guess they're neat.

2704
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:54,780
I like tactical RPGs fine, so it could be fun.

2705
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:58,780
Oh, right.

2706
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:00,780
We were listening to Voice Males.

2707
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:01,780
Yeah.

2708
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:04,780
I got to download that vocabulary one.

2709
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:06,780
There we go.

2710
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:10,780
Next one is, will you remove the S in Crastinators if Gib leaves?

2711
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,780
I mean, yeah, I guess.

2712
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:16,780
Well, no, you could you could change the meaning.

2713
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:20,780
It would be like the procrastinators podcast and you're the procrastinator.

2714
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:23,780
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't have to take the S out.

2715
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:26,780
I would just have to put an apostrophe before it.

2716
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:28,780
Yeah.

2717
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:32,780
That's that's using your noodle.

2718
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:35,780
Next.

2719
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:36,780
Happy birthday, Ben.

2720
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:37,780
Happy birthday, Ben.

2721
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:38,780
YouTube.com.

2722
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:40,780
Guys.

2723
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:42,780
Is it is it?

2724
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:44,780
There's so many YouTube's on the next page.

2725
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:46,780
YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.

2726
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:47,780
Okay.

2727
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:48,780
Next one is Nate Wurstman.

2728
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:51,780
Three, two, one, go.

2729
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:54,780
I'll tell you, baby.

2730
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:57,780
There's one thing I don't like in this world.

2731
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:00,780
No, not dinosaurs.

2732
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:02,780
I don't like Nate Wurstman.

2733
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:04,780
He kind of seems like an asshole now.

2734
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:08,780
Yeah.

2735
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:10,780
He said asshole in front of a baby.

2736
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:13,780
Yeah, baby doesn't know.

2737
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:14,780
I guess he wouldn't remember.

2738
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:15,780
It's fine.

2739
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:16,780
It's funny though.

2740
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:24,780
Dang, the kid hates dinosaurs for some reason.

2741
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:27,780
It's so Jurassic Park.

2742
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,780
It was too scary.

2743
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:33,780
The T-Rex was yelling.

2744
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:34,780
Kids like dinosaurs.

2745
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:37,780
I liked dinosaurs when I was a kid.

2746
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:39,780
Kids these days don't even like dinosaurs.

2747
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:42,780
Kids these days, they're so work moralist.

2748
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:43,780
They're so woke.

2749
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,780
Kids these days.

2750
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:46,780
Oh, they cancel dinosaurs.

2751
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:48,780
Oh, the woke moralists cancel dinosaurs.

2752
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:50,780
Now kids don't like them anymore.

2753
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:53,780
Nowadays, kids, instead of reading about dinosaurs,

2754
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:56,780
they go on Twitter and they make 14 tweet long threads

2755
02:18:56,780 --> 02:19:00,780
about how it's weird how Mordecai from a regular show

2756
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:03,780
is like a creep to women and it's problematic.

2757
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:07,780
It's weird how he like isn't nice to his girlfriend.

2758
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:08,780
We should cancel him.

2759
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,780
We shouldn't give him a platform.

2760
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:13,780
Oh, I didn't look into this at all.

2761
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:16,780
I just saw people going like, what the fuck about it?

2762
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:21,780
But there was some controversy about somebody saying Anne Frank

2763
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:23,780
had white privilege.

2764
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:24,780
Yeah.

2765
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:25,780
Yeah.

2766
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:26,780
Yeah.

2767
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:28,780
It's just like, okay.

2768
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:29,780
Okay.

2769
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:30,780
Well, whatever.

2770
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:31,780
See, yeah.

2771
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:32,780
I mean, okay.

2772
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:33,780
Okay.

2773
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:34,780
Whatever.

2774
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,780
Yeah.

2775
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:40,780
It's like, I mean, I guess.

2776
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:44,780
It had no bearing on anything.

2777
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:48,780
It's like, it's such a weird thing to say.

2778
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,780
Why would you say it?

2779
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:52,780
Yeah.

2780
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:55,780
It just doesn't mean anything because like,

2781
02:19:55,780 --> 02:19:59,780
and that it's like, how is that even relevant to like that

2782
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:01,780
historical context?

2783
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:04,780
It's like, if somebody is talking about like the Jews

2784
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:08,780
under Nazi rule and they're just talking about what happened

2785
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:11,780
to them and then you come over and you're like,

2786
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:13,780
they did have white privilege though.

2787
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:16,780
So it's like, what, what is that adding to any of this?

2788
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:18,780
What is that adding any?

2789
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:20,780
You don't need to say it.

2790
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:21,780
Part of me.

2791
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,780
It's got nothing to do with anything.

2792
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:27,780
Part of me wants to play devil's advocate and be like,

2793
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:30,780
okay, but like technically maybe they kind of did.

2794
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:36,780
Cause like maybe in some situations in Nazi Germany,

2795
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:40,780
you would have been harassed for being visibly black,

2796
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:43,780
but you know, you can't tell a Jew that easily.

2797
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:47,780
So in a certain sense, maybe.

2798
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:52,780
But then also like no, because I'm pretty sure that the Jews

2799
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:56,780
were like, they were being specifically targeted.

2800
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,780
Yeah.

2801
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:00,780
So like probably it would have, I would think it was probably

2802
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:01,780
harder to be a Jew.

2803
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:04,780
I've got to, I think it was probably harder to be a Jew

2804
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:06,780
in Nazi Germany than black.

2805
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:07,780
I don't know.

2806
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:09,780
I don't know if that's true, but it might be.

2807
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:14,780
I mean, if we're going to like go there, I think that there's

2808
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:19,780
not a lot of documentaries made on the suffering of queer

2809
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:23,780
people and black people under Nazi rule, even though we know

2810
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:26,780
that there was discrimination.

2811
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:27,780
I mean, I think there is.

2812
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,780
We know so much more about.

2813
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:32,780
They definitely killed gay people and trans people for sure.

2814
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:33,780
Yeah.

2815
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:34,780
Yeah.

2816
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:39,780
But like the thing that happened to the Jews is so much more

2817
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:42,780
like prominent and obvious.

2818
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,780
So it's not even a white privilege thing.

2819
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:49,780
I haven't heard anything about like, did they, did they, did

2820
02:21:49,780 --> 02:21:51,780
they Holocaust black people?

2821
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,780
Like I don't know.

2822
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:55,780
I would assume that they probably did to some extent.

2823
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,780
They probably killed people.

2824
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:58,780
Yeah.

2825
02:21:58,780 --> 02:21:59,780
Yeah.

2826
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:02,780
But did they like concentration camps?

2827
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:03,780
Yeah.

2828
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:05,780
The concentration camps are odd.

2829
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:08,780
I don't really know what the idea was.

2830
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:12,780
I want to say almost definitely.

2831
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:15,780
I mean it, like they must have.

2832
02:22:15,780 --> 02:22:17,780
Surely they would have been.

2833
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:18,780
I wasn't laughing at that.

2834
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:21,780
I mean, I mean, they, you know, they're doing a, they're

2835
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:23,780
doing a master race thing.

2836
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:25,780
Like, like, of course they did.

2837
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:31,780
So I guess, I guess, I guess the argument is like, OK, well,

2838
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:36,780
theoretically, Anne Frank, because she's, because Jews

2839
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:39,780
kind of look mostly the same.

2840
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:42,780
You kind of can't tell them just by looking at them.

2841
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:46,780
So maybe she could have like pretended not to be one.

2842
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:48,780
And maybe it could have worked.

2843
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:51,780
I guess it depends.

2844
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:57,780
The, theoretically, maybe for some people sometimes.

2845
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:59,780
I don't know.

2846
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:01,780
I don't know.

2847
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:03,780
It just seems like an odd thing.

2848
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:08,780
Just an asinine, just an asinine thing to even like say as though

2849
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:11,780
it like means anything.

2850
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:12,780
Yeah.

2851
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:17,780
As though it like says anything about people or society.

2852
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:19,780
I think that there may be an argument.

2853
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:22,780
Jumbling concepts together into like a nonsense goulash.

2854
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:28,780
There may be an argument about like the victims of Nazi Germany,

2855
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:32,780
the ones we talk about mostly being white.

2856
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:34,780
I don't know what happened to the black people in Germany.

2857
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,780
I know there were some.

2858
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:42,780
I think there just probably weren't very many for them to kill.

2859
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:45,780
But I don't even know what happened.

2860
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:47,780
We never hear about it.

2861
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:50,780
I mean, that's a question to us.

2862
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:52,780
Like, why do we not hear about it?

2863
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:55,780
Was it because they were black and the historians didn't care so much?

2864
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:57,780
That could have been a race thing.

2865
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:01,780
But it's like where to bring up with Anne Frank specifically.

2866
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:06,780
As if like you're trying to take like Anne Frank is hogging the spotlight somehow.

2867
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:14,780
Anne Frank's diary did not properly center indigenous BIPOC voices.

2868
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:16,780
It was very problematic.

2869
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:24,780
You could make a more like reasoned argument to discuss this sort of thing.

2870
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:28,780
Without saying Anne Frank had white privilege.

2871
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,780
Right.

2872
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:30,780
That's it.

2873
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:31,780
I don't know.

2874
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,780
Maybe think about it at least.

2875
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:42,780
I feel like I think you could probably construct an argument for why it's maybe technically true under some readings.

2876
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,780
Maybe.

2877
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:46,780
I don't know.

2878
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:58,780
But yeah, my gut feeling is that probably there were black people, people of color that got concentration camped.

2879
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:01,780
There just weren't many of them around.

2880
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:17,780
And so it was not like a documented thing that there was like, maybe they probably didn't have like, you know, they probably didn't have enough that they could have made their own like separate camp for them that somebody could have made a document about it.

2881
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:23,780
Oh, like the African American, not American, you know.

2882
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:25,780
The African German.

2883
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:32,780
African German concentration camp that they was next door to Auschwitz, but they never, you never hear about it.

2884
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:34,780
I guess, I guess the number of people, I'm not sure.

2885
02:25:34,780 --> 02:25:45,780
No idea of the demographics of the time, but like, they may have still been second class citizens at the time, right?

2886
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:46,780
Is this the sort of time period?

2887
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:54,780
I would imagine that, I would imagine that since kind of the whole thing was like the Aryan supremacy, I got to imagine that.

2888
02:25:54,780 --> 02:26:00,780
Non-white people were not, were not, yeah.

2889
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:04,780
They wouldn't have had much of a say of anything.

2890
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:05,780
Well, whatever.

2891
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:06,780
I would think so.

2892
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:07,780
I would think so.

2893
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:08,780
Yeah, I don't know.

2894
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:12,780
I'm just guessing.

2895
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:16,780
I'm just thinking, okay, you ever just think about stuff?

2896
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,780
No.

2897
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:21,780
Yeah, I don't want to, I want to stop.

2898
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:22,780
It's a problem.

2899
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:25,780
Next one, hang on, did I, did I download that one?

2900
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:26,780
Yes, I did.

2901
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:28,780
Next one is where is best guy ever?

2902
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:30,780
He's all around us.

2903
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:31,780
They said we're.

2904
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:34,780
Oh, so we are best guy ever.

2905
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:35,780
Thanks.

2906
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:40,780
Was Munchy always a member?

2907
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:41,780
No.

2908
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:43,780
No, he joined.

2909
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:47,780
He joined a little earlier than Munky Jones.

2910
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:52,780
Sometime a little bit before Radcon 1?

2911
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:54,780
Was he at Radcon 1?

2912
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:57,780
He was not at Radcon 1, he was at Radcon 2.

2913
02:26:57,780 --> 02:27:02,780
He joined sometime in between Radcon 1 and 2, I think?

2914
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:07,780
I have no idea if there was like an official like thing because we all talked to him.

2915
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:12,780
I think it was just like the day that somebody probably Trixie decided to put him in the call

2916
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:14,780
or in the server we were in.

2917
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:17,780
Yeah, probably, yeah.

2918
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:20,780
That is, yeah, that's how it goes.

2919
02:27:20,780 --> 02:27:25,780
The next one is, these text questions are weird.

2920
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:29,780
Next one is Ben's weekly reminder to not play Delta Rune Chapter 1.

2921
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:30,780
Hey, guess what?

2922
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:36,780
I didn't do that this week, although I did do it at some point, so sorry.

2923
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:39,780
Next one, new fan here.

2924
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:42,780
Who is this Nate guy you keep on mentioning?

2925
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:45,780
Never heard of him.

2926
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:49,780
He goes on about stuff.

2927
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:53,780
Check him out on the best guy ever on YouTube.

2928
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:54,780
Check him out.

2929
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:56,780
His name is Nate Saint.

2930
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:03,780
He works in a button factory.

2931
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:08,780
Next one is, who is best guy ever?

2932
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:11,780
He's on the featured channels, but I've...

2933
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:13,780
Are these sincere?

2934
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:14,780
No.

2935
02:28:14,780 --> 02:28:17,780
I feel like if there's multiple, it's probably not.

2936
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:19,780
And same with Rebel Pixels.

2937
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:22,780
Never seen him either, and I assume...

2938
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:27,780
Like they're cutting themselves off comedically.

2939
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:28,780
They're people.

2940
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:32,780
I mean, if you want to know, you can click on them.

2941
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:33,780
Yeah, you know what?

2942
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:36,780
Yeah, if you really wanted to know.

2943
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:38,780
I mean, do people know that Rebel Pixels is Tom?

2944
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:40,780
It's Tom's old channel?

2945
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:43,780
I assume his channel links to other channels.

2946
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:45,780
It's pretty much defunct.

2947
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:50,780
It is, but if the About page still links to his Twitter, people would find him there.

2948
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:56,780
Oh, you know, I should actually take Tom's links off,

2949
02:28:56,780 --> 02:29:00,780
because he said he's not going to be on anytime soon.

2950
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:03,780
I kind of feel like I should take Nate's off,

2951
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:08,780
but Nate got mad at me the last time I took his link off the linked channel,

2952
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:11,780
even though, I mean, it's not like he ever came back.

2953
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:13,780
So I don't know what that was about.

2954
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:16,780
I feel like it should take it down,

2955
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:19,780
but he got mad last time for what I...

2956
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,780
There was no reason that I could tell, so I don't know what to do.

2957
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:24,780
I don't want to get yelled at.

2958
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:26,780
Yeah, he's playing the long game.

2959
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:32,780
He's going to come back, but after everyone's gone.

2960
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:34,780
It's a wasteland.

2961
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:36,780
Be king over the ashes.

2962
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,780
Yeah, that's the plan.

2963
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:40,780
Just like Dark Souls 3.

2964
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:44,780
Next one is Ben's Weekly Reminder, play Delta Room Chapter 2.

2965
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:47,780
Well, maybe this is the week, friend.

2966
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:51,780
Maybe this could be the week.

2967
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:55,780
It's a very fun game, and I love my friends in the game.

2968
02:29:55,780 --> 02:30:01,780
It's probably good.

2969
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:05,780
Next one, Just Be Don't Try to Become.

2970
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:08,780
Saint Benjamin's Wisdom Corner.

2971
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:11,780
Just Be Don't Try to Become.

2972
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:13,780
Why not?

2973
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:18,780
I think they're saying don't just live in the present.

2974
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:23,780
Don't live in the future only.

2975
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,780
I feel like you've gone overboard.

2976
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:33,780
I feel like this is overshooting the mark of trying to tell me to be content.

2977
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:34,780
Just pee.

2978
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:41,780
Don't try to pee come.

2979
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:43,780
Wow.

2980
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:47,780
Devastating.

2981
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:49,780
Okay.

2982
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:54,780
Next one is called All Women, All of Them.

2983
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:57,780
3, 2, 1, go.

2984
02:30:57,780 --> 02:31:01,780
Hashtag All Women.

2985
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:07,780
I am going to just go nice and lightly and you just leave me on red.

2986
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:10,780
What the fuck?

2987
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:13,780
Wait, what?

2988
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:15,780
Someone left him on red.

2989
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:16,780
Sorry?

2990
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,780
Wait, did I see one on red?

2991
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:21,780
That's why I quit using Twitter.

2992
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:24,780
Not Twitter, a Tinder.

2993
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:26,780
Tinder.

2994
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:28,780
How dare you?

2995
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:30,780
Wait, who did I leave on red?

2996
02:31:30,780 --> 02:31:33,780
I don't think he's talking about you.

2997
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:38,780
No, because the thing is Gib broke to my heart at bigcry.com.

2998
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:42,780
Who is this guy?

2999
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:44,780
Maybe the next one is relevant.

3000
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:46,780
Oh, maybe.

3001
02:31:46,780 --> 02:31:48,780
They'll give you can do better.

3002
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:51,780
3, 2, 1, go.

3003
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:58,780
So I'm listening to episode 317 and Gib, please, I like you, but please brush up on British politics.

3004
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:00,780
You say so many wrong things.

3005
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:01,780
Okay.

3006
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:03,780
Boris Johnson did have no confidence though.

3007
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:05,780
We do have times in the UK.

3008
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:08,780
Boris Johnson didn't have a referendum against Theresa May.

3009
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:12,780
You say so many incorrect things about politics.

3010
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:14,780
Ben knows more than you about British politics.

3011
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:15,780
It's in Palestine.

3012
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:16,780
All right.

3013
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:17,780
Do some research.

3014
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:18,780
No.

3015
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,780
Before you speak about these things.

3016
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:24,780
Like I said, I like you, but you get these so wrong.

3017
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:26,780
I want to push back against the idea that I know more.

3018
02:32:26,780 --> 02:32:28,780
I was just guessing that the prime...

3019
02:32:28,780 --> 02:32:29,780
I didn't know.

3020
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:36,780
I just assumed that the prime minister had terms because I just assumed they were the same as the president.

3021
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,780
It's not four years.

3022
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:38,780
That's all I know.

3023
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:40,780
I'll admit, I don't know.

3024
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:43,780
I don't like brush up on my British politics that much.

3025
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:50,780
But like, I remember we were talking like you just wanted to know what the hell the deal was with Boris Johnson.

3026
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:51,780
Yeah.

3027
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,780
And I said...

3028
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:53,780
Yeah, because I had.

3029
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:56,780
And I explained the thing with the party gate, which is true.

3030
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:59,780
And then from there, a bunch of shit was said.

3031
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:02,780
So yeah, I guess I don't get everything right.

3032
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:05,780
I'm sorry.

3033
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:09,780
I will never speak of British politics again because I don't care about it.

3034
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,780
I don't like it.

3035
02:33:11,780 --> 02:33:13,780
Everyone's so annoying.

3036
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:26,780
So there have been prime ministers that have served like more than 10, 14, 18, 20 years.

3037
02:33:26,780 --> 02:33:29,780
Well, I guess they were serving successive terms.

3038
02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:31,780
Successive terms, yeah.

3039
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:36,780
I think it's usually like five years, although I shouldn't say that.

3040
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:40,780
I shouldn't say that in case this guy gets mad at me again for saying something wrong.

3041
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:42,780
I mean, how often do you...

3042
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:44,780
Wait, do you elect the prime minister?

3043
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:46,780
Well, there's a vote.

3044
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:49,780
Well, how often do you have a vote?

3045
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:51,780
Well, that's the thing.

3046
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:54,780
It's not every four years.

3047
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,780
Sometimes it's not every five years.

3048
02:33:56,780 --> 02:33:58,780
Maybe it is every five years.

3049
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:01,780
It's just sort of random, it feels like.

3050
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:04,780
When politicians making moves...

3051
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:06,780
It's probably just random.

3052
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:10,780
Politicians make moves and then an election is happening and I'm like, ah, shit.

3053
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:12,780
What's happening?

3054
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:14,780
What's going on?

3055
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:17,780
Are you going to elect someone?

3056
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:19,780
Do they just call a vote?

3057
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:20,780
Yeah.

3058
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:21,780
Sometimes?

3059
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:23,780
Sometimes they just call a vote.

3060
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:25,780
I don't know why.

3061
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:27,780
They must...

3062
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:32,780
I agree with this person that I can do better, but British politics is extremely boring

3063
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:37,780
and there's no people that I can look at to make it easy to digest.

3064
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:40,780
I have to actually read and stuff and I don't like that.

3065
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:47,780
I thought I could find the answer easily, but I have not figured it out yet

3066
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:50,780
from some preliminary googling.

3067
02:34:50,780 --> 02:34:53,780
So I guess it's more complicated than I thought.

3068
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:55,780
Yeah.

3069
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:57,780
All right.

3070
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:00,780
Well, we should all do better.

3071
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:02,780
We should all do better.

3072
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:04,780
Namaste.

3073
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:06,780
Go men asai.

3074
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:08,780
Next one is called therapy.

3075
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:11,780
More like take a little bit of these hands.

3076
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:14,780
Three, two, one, go.

3077
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:16,780
Now tell me something.

3078
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:21,780
How can you act like you're anti-capitalist?

3079
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:30,780
You don't like capitalism, but you don't take every single epic game as free weekly game.

3080
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:32,780
I do.

3081
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:35,780
I'm playing Batman right now, bro.

3082
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:39,780
I love being mentally ill, people.

3083
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:44,780
Every so often I'm like, let's see what the new game is on epic games and I get it.

3084
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:47,780
And I never use it because sometimes it's interesting,

3085
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:51,780
but most of the time it's just like, ah, I mean, it's free.

3086
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:54,780
So it's not like I'm losing anything by not having it in my library.

3087
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:57,780
You're losing your life.

3088
02:35:57,780 --> 02:36:00,780
Nah, nah, nah.

3089
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:03,780
You're losing my respect.

3090
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:09,780
Look, if the games are epic, okay, how can you say no to that?

3091
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:15,780
If a guy called Epic Games comes up to you and he says, here's a free game.

3092
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,780
Are you gonna take it?

3093
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:19,780
Mr. Game, sir?

3094
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:21,780
Mr. Game, sir?

3095
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:23,780
Is that you?

3096
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:25,780
Yes, child.

3097
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:27,780
It's me.

3098
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:29,780
Epic Games.

3099
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:33,780
Take Batman and beat the unwell.

3100
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:35,780
Yeah, I probably would, honestly.

3101
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:37,780
Yeah.

3102
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:39,780
Can't say no.

3103
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:41,780
Capitalism?

3104
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:43,780
Good, actually.

3105
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:45,780
Did I talk about...

3106
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:47,780
Oh, man.

3107
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:52,780
Did I talk about that one guy, that Irish economist

3108
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:55,780
that I watch on YouTube now?

3109
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:57,780
Patrick...

3110
02:36:57,780 --> 02:36:59,780
You may have.

3111
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:01,780
It was a card churning...

3112
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,780
It's that guy.

3113
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:05,780
It's that guy, yeah.

3114
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:11,780
Did I mention the thing that he said that I thought was interesting?

3115
02:37:11,780 --> 02:37:18,780
That's kind of like the Blitzkrieg economics

3116
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:24,780
where a company spends tons and tons of money to give people free shit

3117
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:27,780
just for the sake of establishing themselves as the market leader

3118
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:31,780
so that then they can raise prices later and make money

3119
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:34,780
once the demand has been created.

3120
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:37,780
That that's kind of like...

3121
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:40,780
It's sort of like...

3122
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:44,780
Companies just spend tons of money to give people shit for free.

3123
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:46,780
It's kind of just how that works out.

3124
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:48,780
Yeah, I mean, it's a good tactic.

3125
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,780
That's how Amazon started.

3126
02:37:50,780 --> 02:37:53,780
Well, not literally exactly like that,

3127
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:56,780
but they undersold themselves for a long time.

3128
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:58,780
I mean, it's good when it works.

3129
02:37:58,780 --> 02:38:00,780
It doesn't always work.

3130
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:04,780
I mean, most of the time, they just blow all their money

3131
02:38:04,780 --> 02:38:08,780
trying to establish a market and then it doesn't work.

3132
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:13,780
And then they basically just blew all their money giving people free shit.

3133
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:16,780
I mean, potentially.

3134
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:19,780
However, Epic Games did create Fortnite,

3135
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:22,780
so I think they've got enough to go around.

3136
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:24,780
I mean, yeah.

3137
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:30,780
They had the money available to do this free games every month thing.

3138
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:33,780
Or every week? I think it's every week.

3139
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:36,780
You just log in, you'd get a free game.

3140
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:39,780
My library is filled with things I will never click on.

3141
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:42,780
Just like on Steam, but I didn't spend any money.

3142
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:46,780
Patrick Boyle. Patrick Boyle, that's his name.

3143
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:48,780
You know what I just realized?

3144
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:51,780
I have not played Noida in weeks.

3145
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:54,780
And like fucking finally, the game is a curse.

3146
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:56,780
The game's evil. It sucks also.

3147
02:38:56,780 --> 02:38:58,780
It's bad and it's terrible.

3148
02:38:58,780 --> 02:39:00,780
I agree.

3149
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:02,780
I don't miss it.

3150
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:04,780
I've had enough. Had enough of its bullshit.

3151
02:39:04,780 --> 02:39:06,780
Where was I?

3152
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:08,780
The next one is an injure link.

3153
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:10,780
It's an image of text that says,

3154
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:12,780
reading the responses to the Abe assassination,

3155
02:39:12,780 --> 02:39:14,780
or Abe assassination,

3156
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:17,780
it seems that Japan must have been at war with whatever country

3157
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:19,780
trans flag is.

3158
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:24,780
Yeah.

3159
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:26,780
You know, I'll be honest.

3160
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:30,780
I didn't really know anything about that guy.

3161
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:33,780
You know, I mean, I heard after he was assassinated,

3162
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,780
I heard everyone saying, yeah, he was like

3163
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:38,780
leader of like a right coalition.

3164
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:40,780
He's kind of, he's a nationalist.

3165
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:43,780
I was like, okay, well, cool, cool, good.

3166
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:49,780
Like a nationalist and we need to return to empire.

3167
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:52,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3168
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:56,780
And I guess it was very anti-trans.

3169
02:39:56,780 --> 02:39:58,780
I haven't looked into him that much.

3170
02:39:58,780 --> 02:40:01,780
That fits everything else that I know about him.

3171
02:40:01,780 --> 02:40:03,780
It wouldn't surprise me.

3172
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:05,780
Yeah.

3173
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:07,780
But I didn't, like,

3174
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:10,780
I didn't know he was a bad guy before,

3175
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:12,780
because I just, I mean, I'd heard the name.

3176
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:15,780
If you'd asked me who was Shinzo Abe,

3177
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:17,780
I might have just guessed,

3178
02:40:17,780 --> 02:40:19,780
was he the prime minister of Japan?

3179
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:23,780
Because like, I don't know, what else would he be?

3180
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:26,780
And you already know all the Nintendo people.

3181
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:29,780
Yeah, he's not a Nintendo guy, I'm pretty sure.

3182
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:31,780
But I've just said he was either,

3183
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:33,780
was he like the composer for Dragon Quest

3184
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:35,780
or the prime minister of Japan?

3185
02:40:35,780 --> 02:40:37,780
And I would have been right.

3186
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:39,780
That's how you win. You guess two.

3187
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:42,780
You guess two and then you double your chances.

3188
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:45,780
Anyway, I don't know.

3189
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,780
I guess he's dead.

3190
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:52,780
And trans people keep on winning, I guess.

3191
02:40:52,780 --> 02:40:57,780
The next one is a high-bend.

3192
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:00,780
Okay, three, two, one, go.

3193
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:03,780
You know, it has been exactly 201 days

3194
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:06,780
since I first requested Best Guy Ever

3195
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:10,780
to send me the instrumental .mp3 track

3196
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:15,780
to the Brad Garlinghouse instrumental .mp3

3197
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:19,780
diss track for me to wrap over.

3198
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:22,780
And I think that, you know,

3199
02:41:22,780 --> 02:41:25,780
that's kind of a dick move to not respond, you know.

3200
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:27,780
Baby, what do you think?

3201
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:28,780
No, no, no.

3202
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:31,780
Yeah, see, say Nate?

3203
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:34,780
Nate!

3204
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:37,780
Nate Bestman's a big faggot.

3205
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:39,780
Come on.

3206
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:40,780
No.

3207
02:41:40,780 --> 02:41:44,780
Well, I guess he just doesn't want to be hashtag canceled.

3208
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:48,780
But, you know, I remember how things were in 2019.

3209
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:50,780
So I'm going to keep saying that word

3210
02:41:50,780 --> 02:41:52,780
and no one's going to stop me.

3211
02:41:52,780 --> 02:41:55,780
Get me money, please.

3212
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:56,780
Okay.

3213
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:59,780
It's funny, but please don't actually teach your baby

3214
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:02,780
those words.

3215
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:04,780
Yeah, I remember.

3216
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:06,780
Let them figure it out for themselves

3217
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:08,780
so that they can tell you.

3218
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:15,780
I remember he asked me, as in, Voidgazer asked me,

3219
02:42:16,780 --> 02:42:20,780
about, yeah, the instrumental track for Garlinghouse

3220
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:22,780
and I said I didn't have it.

3221
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:24,780
And I think I asked Nate.

3222
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:26,780
I think I asked Nate.

3223
02:42:26,780 --> 02:42:28,780
I could ask him again.

3224
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:31,780
You know, I guess next time I talk to him,

3225
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:34,780
I'll ask him again if he's got that track.

3226
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:39,780
Nate's not good about doing stuff sometimes,

3227
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:42,780
but I'll ask him again.

3228
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:44,780
Sorry about that.

3229
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:49,780
Next one is Hi Ben 2.

3230
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:51,780
3, 2, 1, go.

3231
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:54,780
Nate Bestman, you fucking Paul Huck,

3232
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:58,780
and you do not believe the instrumental

3233
02:42:58,780 --> 02:43:03,780
to the fucking Brad Garlinghouse lecture.

3234
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:06,780
I will release upon you

3235
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:10,780
the most smiteful diss track there has ever been.

3236
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:11,780
Do it.

3237
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:12,780
Do it, Pussy.

3238
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:17,780
Either you or your Asian wife will recover indefinitely

3239
02:43:17,780 --> 02:43:21,780
from my sick burns, and you can count on that.

3240
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:24,780
So, release it now.

3241
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:27,780
Well, now I don't want to ask him.

3242
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,780
Because I want him to do that.

3243
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:32,780
Oh, was that the last one?

3244
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:34,780
That was the last one, yeah.

3245
02:43:34,780 --> 02:43:36,780
Crazy.

3246
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:39,780
It sounded like halfway through that one

3247
02:43:39,780 --> 02:43:43,780
that the baby had tackled into the ground.

3248
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:44,780
Oh, you think so?

3249
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:46,780
Wait a minute.

3250
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:47,780
We just got another one.

3251
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:49,780
Or no, we got one 20 minutes ago.

3252
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:52,780
So there is another one, actually.

3253
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:57,780
Baby.

3254
02:44:00,780 --> 02:44:02,780
Alright, I think the last one is called

3255
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:04,780
Serious Question Time.

3256
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:07,780
3, 2, 1, go.

3257
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:11,780
You think milk is one of those inherently lewd sounding words?

3258
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:12,780
No.

3259
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:14,780
Or has it become one?

3260
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:15,780
Neither.

3261
02:44:15,780 --> 02:44:20,780
I mean, the glass of milk doesn't immediately

3262
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:23,780
conjure my mind sex,

3263
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:29,780
but it doesn't seem out of place in a lewd situation.

3264
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:33,780
I would say that it's more not lewd.

3265
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:36,780
Yeah, I would say the word on its own.

3266
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:41,780
I mean, it's not like milk

3267
02:44:41,780 --> 02:44:46,780
actually does anything in sex.

3268
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:49,780
It merely suggests...

3269
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:53,780
I'm being fucked so much that milk is appearing.

3270
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:54,780
No.

3271
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:58,780
Oh my god, that's how it happens, right?

3272
02:44:58,780 --> 02:45:06,780
In certain illustrated genres, perhaps.

3273
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:11,780
Not in the real world of real pornography,

3274
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:15,780
where I live,

3275
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:19,780
milk merely suggests breasts.

3276
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:23,780
It's like two steps away from sex.

3277
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:26,780
Honestly, for me, it doesn't even suggest breasts.

3278
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:28,780
It's not even adjacent.

3279
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:30,780
When I think milk,

3280
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:34,780
I think of getting something out of the fridge to pour in my cereal

3281
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:36,780
or to put in my tea,

3282
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:38,780
or to use in a cake.

3283
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:40,780
I don't really think of where it came from,

3284
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:43,780
either others or otherwise.

3285
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:49,780
It's funny that you, the creator of the big boobies mommy milkers,

3286
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:52,780
server would feel that way.

3287
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:54,780
I mean, I am the big boober.

3288
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:56,780
Moon Koon was the mommy milker.

3289
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:57,780
I see.

3290
02:45:57,780 --> 02:45:58,780
So it makes sense.

3291
02:45:58,780 --> 02:45:59,780
Not your domain.

3292
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:01,780
It's not my forte.

3293
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:02,780
Yeah.

3294
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:05,780
Well, yeah, I don't know.

3295
02:46:05,780 --> 02:46:10,780
This guy is bringing his baggage into it.

3296
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:14,780
Like milkers as a word.

3297
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:16,780
Obviously, that's slang.

3298
02:46:16,780 --> 02:46:20,780
But I don't think of it as the place where milk comes from.

3299
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:23,780
I think of it as in reference to big boobies.

3300
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:27,780
Milking or other ways.

3301
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:32,780
I think this, just because this guy was talking in this context,

3302
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:35,780
it got me making connections.

3303
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:37,780
No, you got to work.

3304
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:41,780
You got to work to get from milk to sex a little bit.

3305
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:44,780
And I hate work.

3306
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:48,780
So thanks for the voicemail.

3307
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:49,780
That's it.

3308
02:46:49,780 --> 02:46:50,780
We did it.

3309
02:46:50,780 --> 02:46:51,780
We made it.

3310
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:52,780
We did it.

3311
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:54,780
I don't know.

3312
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:56,780
That guy's going to be pissed.

3313
02:46:56,780 --> 02:46:59,780
Or that multiple people are going to be pissed.

3314
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:01,780
It's not four hours long.

3315
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:04,780
Oh, hey, you know what I did?

3316
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:05,780
I actually upload.

3317
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:07,780
There's a new bonus episode.

3318
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:08,780
Oh, fuck.

3319
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:11,780
There's another behind the scenes bonus episode.

3320
02:47:11,780 --> 02:47:16,780
It's another hour and some of us talking about whatever when

3321
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:18,780
we're off the podcast.

3322
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:22,780
So if you're a patron, patron dot com slash the procrastinators,

3323
02:47:22,780 --> 02:47:26,780
check the pinned master list for bonus episodes.

3324
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:27,780
I think it's number 59.

3325
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:29,780
It's the one at the top of the list.

3326
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:31,780
It's the newest one.

3327
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:33,780
Check it out.

3328
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:38,780
If you want to listen to some shit, you know.

3329
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:41,780
Oh, listen to that shit.

3330
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:42,780
Yeah.

3331
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:45,780
And that's all I have to say.

3332
02:47:46,780 --> 02:47:48,780
Yes.

3333
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:49,780
People.

3334
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:51,780
Well, I say people never paint.

3335
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:55,780
Ask me if I'm going to do more streams with Elden Ring.

3336
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:56,780
Yeah.

3337
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:58,780
It's very hot.

3338
02:47:58,780 --> 02:48:00,780
So it would be, I would be uncomfortable most of the time,

3339
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:07,780
but maybe during the night, which would be like six to eight,

3340
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:14,780
nine PM EST, I could maybe do, do a stream here or there.

3341
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:19,780
I've, I've, I've mostly been doing nothing,

3342
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:21,780
but I want to get back into the doing stuff.

3343
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:25,780
I didn't really talk about that, but like, I've still got the commissions to do.

3344
02:48:25,780 --> 02:48:27,780
I've still got Lord of Ghost things to send a few of those.

3345
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:30,780
How many, how many commissions you got left?

3346
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:32,780
That's six.

3347
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:33,780
Yeah.

3348
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:35,780
Is that more than last time?

3349
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:37,780
I don't remember what I said last time.

3350
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:41,780
I don't even know if that's the right number, but it's a, it's not like one.

3351
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:42,780
It's not two.

3352
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:47,780
It's more and I'll do it.

3353
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,780
All right.

3354
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:52,780
Excellent.

3355
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:55,780
But yeah, at some point I might stream.

3356
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:59,780
I feel like streaming is off limits because I have other obligations,

3357
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:03,780
but I mean, if I'm not doing them, what's the harm?

3358
02:49:03,780 --> 02:49:06,780
So maybe who knows?

3359
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:10,780
I gotta do it.

3360
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:11,780
I'm gonna, I will do them.

3361
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:13,780
Ben, I'll do it.

3362
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:15,780
I, I know you'll do them.

3363
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:16,780
I'll do it, Ben.

3364
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:17,780
I know you'll.

3365
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:18,780
Please don't hit me, Ben.

3366
02:49:18,780 --> 02:49:19,780
I'll do it.

3367
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:24,780
I know you'll do it because I would be so, so disappointed in you if you didn't.

3368
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:26,780
So I know you'll do it.

3369
02:49:26,780 --> 02:49:28,780
Oh, cool.

3370
02:49:28,780 --> 02:49:29,780
Yeah.

3371
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:34,780
Okay, I'll keep making my stupid book.

3372
02:49:35,780 --> 02:49:40,780
I can't, I can't let it cost $40 to fucking ship.

3373
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:43,780
It will just be like that.

3374
02:49:43,780 --> 02:49:45,780
It's, it's unacceptable.

3375
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:46,780
That's unacceptable.

3376
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:55,780
You can maybe get it somewhat cheaper, but it won't be like lower than $20 to $30.

3377
02:49:56,780 --> 02:50:04,780
Oh, no, there must be some, there must be some scheme.

3378
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:09,780
There must be some scheme I can pull off in order to reverse my fortunes.

3379
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:11,780
You will have to look around.

3380
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:16,780
I don't know whether Transglobal Express works the other way around,

3381
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:20,780
but they have good prices for UK to America.

3382
02:50:20,780 --> 02:50:22,780
I'll Google it.

3383
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,780
I'll Google it.

3384
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:28,780
I think it is a UK based shipping company, but, you know, who knows?

3385
02:50:28,780 --> 02:50:36,780
There might be some service that compares rates of these things,

3386
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:41,780
and there might be a better price than USPS available somewhere.

3387
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:42,780
I don't know.

3388
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:44,780
I'll have to look into it.

3389
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:51,780
Maybe, maybe perhaps, perhaps some sort of like fulfillment service

3390
02:50:51,780 --> 02:50:58,780
wherein I just send one huge box of stuff and to some,

3391
02:50:58,780 --> 02:51:02,780
I send it in one big box to someone who then distributes it for me.

3392
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:04,780
Perhaps.

3393
02:51:04,780 --> 02:51:07,780
It sounds like a thing that might exist.

3394
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:10,780
I think, you know what, I think things like that do exist,

3395
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:13,780
but they are far bigger on scale.

3396
02:51:13,780 --> 02:51:17,780
So like for the amount of people you would be sending to,

3397
02:51:17,780 --> 02:51:19,780
it would be more expensive.

3398
02:51:19,780 --> 02:51:23,780
You'd need to like hire out, and not lease,

3399
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:27,780
but like hire out warehouse space to hold it,

3400
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:30,780
and then like salaries of people to move it around

3401
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:33,780
and send it to all the individual people.

3402
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:37,780
They start as like kind of big things.

3403
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:42,780
Like it would have to be like doing at least like hundreds of units.

3404
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:44,780
Yeah, yeah.

3405
02:51:44,780 --> 02:51:46,780
I mean, I'm not sure.

3406
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:48,780
Maybe it's something like that.

3407
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:50,780
I'll look into it.

3408
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:52,780
Yeah, I'll look into it.

3409
02:51:58,780 --> 02:52:03,780
I can't, I can't, I can't let it cost that much.

3410
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:05,780
It's unacceptable.

3411
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:08,780
Anyway.

3412
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:11,780
Okay, I guess that's the, I guess let's wrap up.

3413
02:52:11,780 --> 02:52:13,780
Become a patron.

3414
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:17,780
Become a patron, get bonus episodes every month or so.

3415
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:19,780
59 bonus episodes.

3416
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:22,780
We haven't done, we haven't done one in a while.

3417
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:25,780
Surely there's lots of like behind the scenes stuff.

3418
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:29,780
There are nine of them now, I think.

3419
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:33,780
Like made or like ready to be made.

3420
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:37,780
No, like made that you can listen to right now.

3421
02:52:37,780 --> 02:52:39,780
Yeah.

3422
02:52:39,780 --> 02:52:42,780
I think, you know, it'll be a good bonus episode.

3423
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:44,780
What?

3424
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:47,780
I've been trying to get on Nate's case about the OVA.

3425
02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:50,780
I'm trying to get him to hire someone to edit it together for him,

3426
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:54,780
because I know he won't, he won't do it.

3427
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:58,780
Or he'll say he's going to do it and it's going to take him like a year.

3428
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:02,780
So I'm trying to get him to just pay someone to edit it for him.

3429
02:53:02,780 --> 02:53:08,780
But when that's done, there's probably going to be a bunch of like behind the scenes footage.

3430
02:53:08,780 --> 02:53:10,780
And that'd be good, that'd be a good bonus.

3431
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:13,780
Maybe we could do another like documentary, like you do with Radcom too.

3432
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:16,780
Of the recording of the OVA, yeah.

3433
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:18,780
Yeah, yeah.

3434
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:23,780
So I'll try and get something like that at some point.

3435
02:53:23,780 --> 02:53:26,780
Yeah, yeah.

3436
02:53:26,780 --> 02:53:31,780
Also, five dollars or more you get access to the Minecraft server.

3437
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:34,780
Oh, I didn't.

3438
02:53:34,780 --> 02:53:37,780
You can mine and craft and catch Pokemon also.

3439
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:43,780
Okay, this week, this week I will set up my Wi-Fi extender.

3440
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:45,780
I promise I will do this.

3441
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:47,780
How have you been living?

3442
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:51,780
I mean, your internet has seemed all right right now in this call.

3443
02:53:51,780 --> 02:53:53,780
No, my internet is okay.

3444
02:53:53,780 --> 02:53:55,780
Like it's not that bad.

3445
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:56,780
It's just...

3446
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:58,780
It's when you stream.

3447
02:53:58,780 --> 02:54:00,780
It's just when...

3448
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:05,780
Yeah, or it's mainly just when I connect to the Minecraft server.

3449
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:08,780
Like it's specifically a problem with the Minecraft server.

3450
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:14,780
The streaming thing was not because I was accidentally using my phone data to stream.

3451
02:54:14,780 --> 02:54:16,780
And that's why it was really bad that one time.

3452
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:19,780
Most of the time, it's okay.

3453
02:54:19,780 --> 02:54:24,780
It's just, it was just connecting to the Minecraft server was impossible.

3454
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:27,780
Um...

3455
02:54:27,780 --> 02:54:32,780
So I'll try, this week I will set up my Wi-Fi extender and I will try it again.

3456
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:34,780
And see what happens.

3457
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:37,780
I've been saying that for two weeks, but this time I really did.

3458
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:38,780
Yeah.

3459
02:54:38,780 --> 02:54:40,780
Um, okay.

3460
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,780
All right, that's the end of the episode.

3461
02:54:42,780 --> 02:54:43,780
That's it.

3462
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:44,780
Goodbye.

3463
02:54:44,780 --> 02:54:46,780
Bye.
