1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, I'm gonna zoom the fuck out and it's gonna start like this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's quite a place.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You are a part of a social media experiment right now.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We have come up with the hit new trend.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Viral marketing.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Check out this shit.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Advertisements.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Online.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're watching one right now.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You got some shit.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You got some shit on your face.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's just called passion for internet viral marketing.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What you call shit, I call fire.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I call charisma.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I call dollar signs in my eyes when I see advertisements.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Marketing.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Branding.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Merchandise.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Merchandise.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're hired.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're hired.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, yes.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm in the ground floor, baby.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast, episode 142.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We're the reason people are dying.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's a special live episode from Radcon 3.33.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are no lectures.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please stop asking.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You cannot.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Everyone's leaving.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Everyone's leaving tomorrow.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We can't do it.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We can't.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We can't fucking pee brains.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can't fucking handle it.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Maybe we should just tell people in general why we're here together.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That'd be pretty cool.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why are we here together?

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
First of all.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My name's not Nate.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm the Jester King.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Refer to me by my full legal.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am Nate.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So the reason we all got together here was because we've just been talking for a long time about our various future plans.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And people were asking us about stuff.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So we got together here.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're at Digi's place outside of Boston.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And we thought we would just...

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Give me a dress.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Give me a dress.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give me a dress.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can see nary a tumbleweed.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ignore another man.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We just thought we'd get together and hash out as best we could some future plans for future shows.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not necessarily exactly PCP related.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I don't know.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I guess we won't get into it too much.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think there's something that may have just rendered this entire meetup moot.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As you see.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's just my attention.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, I'm on the ground floor.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know, I'm up in forums.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm in message boards.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I get...

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm in IRC chats.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I get updates on the web daily, bro.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am online as the so-called online.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I found some crazy technology.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Apparently, there's an app that will allow you to talk to people from far away.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So if you are at different locations, you can talk to one another with your voice and possibly even have a meeting of some sort to exchange ideas to little to no cost.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wow.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If only we'd known this existed, we could have just not done this entire trip.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That would have made this whole thing a complete waste of time and money.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you know?

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Fuck yeah, dude!

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Fuck yeah!

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Woo!

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Uh, well, I'm just glad to see you guys, no matter what.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That makes me one of us.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This has ballooned out from I came out here for fun, for pleasure, for raw, un-untamed pleasure.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then I think you were the first one's dog pile.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I mean, I just said, well, let's have a meeting.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's all meet up and talk about stuff.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Uh, and yeah.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, I figured part of it was because Nate had not come home for the holidays.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That was an element, yes.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He was missing the old fam, up here in Boston.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's true.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's fair.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So yeah, he came to see his mama and papa.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yep, briefly.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then came over here to Jack Dick for two days about where the fuck are we gonna try to set up a PCPHQ!

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
As the meme has been going for fucking five years.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Would you say it's fair to say that PCPHQ is not what we discussed?

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I mean, depending on how you look at it.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's who's living where.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Conceptually, what PCPHQ has only ever meant to me is more than one guy lives in the same place and does a show together.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So PCPHQ is already here right now.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, this could be seen as a PCPHQ because we're doing the PCP in a headquarters together.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It is a PCPHQ, but not the PCPHQ.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a temporary PCPHQ.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
PCPHQ is really more of a state of mind.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The real PCPHQ was the friends we made along the way.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We're having wars with various cities so they can pledge and they can offer lower tax cuts for their PCPHQ.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm thinking it's like when you're fighting a battle and they set up a temporary headquarters on the front lines.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That sort of HQ.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've always envisioned PCPHQ would come into being basically when we moved up to the next level of content creation.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It was like a soft green light for it to be actual PCPHQ, which in my mind always involved a studio or could be in somebody's house.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think the second that there is a permanent fixed setup for multiple members of the PCP to do a show together.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That is what the thing has been.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What do you call it? Doesn't matter.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But that is the thing that we've been building towards is get enough of us in one place with a permanent setup doing a fixed show that is not an audio part.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The biggest obstacle is the goal.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That sounds like the goal.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyways, how's IM Games doing?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
IM Games is doing okay.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's exactly what you're just describing.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Two people in the same permanent place doing a show that isn't an audio part.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You could say that that is a PCPHQ project.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess so.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It makes sense.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are we going to get into all these things or are we just cock teasing people who actually can?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Cock teasing is just funny.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We don't want to say anything too.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We did not come away with this having a decided plan.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We don't have a concrete plan here.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't want to hype up our fans.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll tell people this.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
On the idea of what we would go on, we generally are all on the same page.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We have general technicalities.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mostly we understand where the others lie and we have something going there.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The biggest thing we're still working on has always been by far.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The biggest obstacle is actually getting the human bodies in the location and figuring out what the best place is to do that.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's always been true that the best way for that to happen is to make more money.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We've continually made more money so it's become more possible.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's absolutely true.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But we still haven't made enough money for it to be easy.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
True.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think that our vision was that we would just have this constant up the escalator of how much we're making.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then we'd reach some certain cross some threshold where it becomes like,

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
oh, we can fly all my fucking dudes out to the same neighborhood.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not at that level yet.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, it's always been, I don't know.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It has worked out that it seems like some of us have to individually find success to even be in a position to attempt to do that.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Which is more or less what's happened.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I love talking in vagaries at length.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's nothing more to say.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We can tell them some of the places we're looking at, but what's the fucking point?

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We can at least say that if you and I get a place in the same neighborhood,

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we guaranteed we'll make a Red Letter Media rip-off show.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's true.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you want to see us rip off Red Letter Media,

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
aka the plebe and the weave except it's me and Nate,

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then just give us a couple extra dollars so we can expedite the process.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do what you can.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Do what you feel comfortable with.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If that sounds like gay shit, then kill yourself.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey, do you want to inspire a new spin?

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shit.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, you left it at home?

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I tied it.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I tied it already.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, but it's all downstairs and there's girls downstairs.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't fucking kill myself with girls around.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You know, you shit yourself when you die?

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're so embarrassing.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, what else is going on in the old heads of our men?

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There's so much startups.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There's so many startups that I've been starting recently.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The Kickstarter's are just through the fucking roof.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Not like I've gotten a lot from them, but there are just a lot of them.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I've got a Kickstarter.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've got an Indiegogo.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've got a GoFundMe.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've got a Patreon.

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've got a LinkedIn.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've got a Subbable.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've got a LinkedIn doesn't pay you any money.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But it could.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not a crowdfunding platform.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Obviously, you're not using the platform the way that I am.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've got a Teespring.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I've got a can that I put in front of me out of the fucking subway.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I've got a Teespring, a spreadsheet.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I've got a Pinterest.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I've got an Etsy.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Fuck yeah.

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A print all over me.

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's the premium shit.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Think that about it.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't think of any cool, fucking sick anecdotes.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Like, oh man, the other day, just saw a homeless guy do so cool.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because for the past three to nine years of my entire life, it feels like now.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We've just been stewing and fucking stewing about hardcore business real life bullshit.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And frankly, it's melted my mind to a complete mush.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I don't have anything to say about anything.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We spent like 90 years yesterday, like fucking at the park playing Pokemon Go to the Pole.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah!

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was fucking sick!

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah!

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Woo!

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, dude.

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, fucking dude.

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm air high five with all those.

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm so mad.

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because we were doing a raid.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I was going to get someone to train me.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They're fucking Pokemon.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And they didn't.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What a bitch.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I was going to catch a heatran yesterday.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I did catch a shiny totodile.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So that was cool.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Four.

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Fucking Pokemon Go.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Four shiny totodiles.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Got away.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Miss the heatran.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And that sucks.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Everyone's like, oh, Pokemon Go is so interesting.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Guys, please talk about capitalism.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We want you to talk more about your weird political bullshit.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We listen to it every episode.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it's never enough.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Every episode is political garbage.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But it's never enough to satiate us.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So please go arm to arm.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because the last time it came up, I mean, I know that's like you're joking kind of.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No.

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But people wanted to know the end of the conversation that was happening with capitalism stuff.

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was like to fucking fight about it.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was getting really heated.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But we were all so tired from that episode.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Which episode was this?

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The one that just, the last one.

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I did have one point I wanted to make that I kind of regretted not shoving in there.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Which was simply this.

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, I do literally believe taxation is theft.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I still think that some injustice is warranted for the sake of the greater good.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Which is effectively leftist politics.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Which is, that's the point.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So do I think that all taxes make no sense and should be stopped immediately?

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because like, you know, a doctor has to fucking cut you open and hurt you a little bit to fix the disease inside.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Similar sort of fucking thing, in my opinion.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How fair would you say the comparison from taxes to rent is?

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Pretty similar.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, relatively similar.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
With rent, you have the option to leave.

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you live in a nation, you don't really have the option to leave.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where are you going to do?

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Not live anywhere?

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not pay any rent?

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, I mean, if you say like rent in general, I mean, I suppose that's fair.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, no.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because like, you can't really choose to find somewhere else.

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can live without a house over your head.

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can live.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, you can survive.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're homeless people all over the place.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, it depends on the kind of life that you want.

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here in America, you got three unalienable rights.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't need a house for any of those.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well, I mean, it just depends on the kind of life.

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like, if you want to be, for example, a online content creator, you're going to need internet.

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, you have the ability to pursue that happiness.

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, you will have to pay rent, but that is because you made the decision that you wanted

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to be something other than homeless.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That falls on you.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There's no one else's responsibility over there.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sure.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Whereas taxes is like, like you said, you can't leave.

280
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah.

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You have no option.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You just have to pay it because you made income in the country.

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You know?

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They actually could move somewhere else with lower taxes.

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That is theoretically possible, but it's just much harder.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, even like leaving, like you'd have to leave America and find a country that had

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
no taxes.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And that's really difficult.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Which probably I haven't looked, but probably doesn't exist.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you're going to, I mean, you can't really find a house that doesn't ask you to pay anything.

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right?

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, there are some places like that.

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That are literally free to walk in.

294
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I mean, like, you know, if somebody's just like some weird benefactor situation, I mean,

295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ben lived in a place for a little while that like someone had just.

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There was, we were, we were suing, they were suing the landlord because the landlord was

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
trying to evict them without notice or cause.

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So there was a six months period where the fucking legal shit was going down where no

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
one was paying any rent to live there.

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Magical.

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We've really hit the ground running.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Haha.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Welcome to the PCP.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
All right.

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Everyone's going wild over this banana pizza.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's fucking crazy, dog.

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Shut the fuck up, Skeeter.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm with Patty.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She's getting all sad and glossy-eyed.

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sure.

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
May have put a little bit of stuff in her drink, I'm saying.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But hey, listen.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Patty, she's mine.

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Back off, Skeeter.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Patty, listen.

319
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can't, you have to eat.

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You didn't eat all day before the big track meet.

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Your body needs food.

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Patty!

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Or eat some of this banana pudding pizza.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Patty!

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're gonna fucking die.

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Patty, it's the next big thing.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're not gonna believe it.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Buy gold, Patty.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The fucking cops are coming.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You don't want to be caught off guard.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We'll buy the bottom drop.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're gonna need two things.

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're gonna need water and gold.

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're gonna need banana pudding pizza.

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's gonna be the currency in the future.

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No one's gonna want to eat anything else once this hits.

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey, hey guys.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah?

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's do the intro again.

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's restart.

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You guys, you brought this up specifically.

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It was you who made it.

343
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Everyone's prepared for a big fight.

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But I don't think anyone here among us is like ready or willing or wants to fight about

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
something that obviously nothing.

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, you weren't.

347
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No, you weren't.

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You weren't.

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You weren't.

350
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You weren't.

351
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You weren't.

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You weren't.

353
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You weren't.

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You weren't.

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You weren't.

356
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You weren't.

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You weren't.

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You weren't.

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You weren't.

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You weren't.

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You weren't.

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You weren't.

363
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You weren't.

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,720
And 300 or something like that obviously nothing.

365
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
You were, no no you were right.

366
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Yeah.

367
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
You were right.

368
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
It's terrible.

369
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah.

370
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
I was mistaken.

371
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,800
Ah, okay, good.

372
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Fantastic.

373
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh.

374
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Did you have been doing this thing all night where he just silent write something down

375
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,480
and then shows us to us?

376
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Uh, I...

377
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,240
I don't know what the like expected response is, just like, haha, fuck, yeah, did she sick?

378
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,440
I mean, have you seen the world famous probably up to a million 10 million views by now.

379
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,480
Video, noogle, on this very channel, uh, uh, inspired by just didgy writing on this board.

380
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,280
So clearly the dividends are paying off in triplicate, if more.

381
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,240
Yeah, we've made a lot of money off of Google and Tugel.

382
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,280
We're going to be launching 3Gal next year.

383
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,240
That'll be after Tugel inevitably fails.

384
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, you have a little bit of a pity.

385
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,560
And then the subsidiary of 3Gal Seagal,

386
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,240
you kicked me out of the Tugel share.

387
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,040
I was 50-50 with you.

388
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
And now you're starting 3Gal without me?

389
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,040
Well, I got other friends who need to pay their bills, too.

390
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,880
This is never mine.

391
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,800
I fell down.

392
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Just like my love life.

393
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
The invisible hand of the free market

394
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
just gave you the middle finger.

395
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,840
Just scooched you right off the edge of the Grand Canyon,

396
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
right into the slime scene.

397
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,720
Digi, you know that thing that you always say?

398
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
It's like a catchphrase.

399
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,440
It's like holy shit, but for the new age.

400
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
I don't know what anyone else is doing.

401
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,760
No one knows what anyone else is doing.

402
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,040
That catchphrase you said to us last time?

403
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,160
What the hell are you talking about?

404
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200
I don't remember that.

405
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Anyway.

406
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,400
It says the invisible hand of the free market.

407
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,360
It's invisible.

408
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,840
Nice one.

409
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,760
I'm showing it to the camera.

410
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
I can't see it on the screen.

411
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,680
It makes it extra bold.

412
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,680
It was in relation to how everyone,

413
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
knowing the PCP talks about their working shit,

414
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,280
you don't know what anyone else is working on.

415
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,880
I don't know what anyone else is working on,

416
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,440
besides in vague, vagaluridies, right?

417
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,560
I feel like I know what everybody's working on.

418
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,400
OK, well, cool.

419
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,080
I think.

420
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,240
Cookies are done.

421
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
Who the fuck is making cookies?

422
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,640
I heard a ding.

423
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,360
It sounded like cookies are done.

424
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,760
Let's talk about what we're working on.

425
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,080
That's interesting, I think.

426
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,320
Yeah, I mean.

427
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,880
All right.

428
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,560
What are you working on, Hippo Crit?

429
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,920
What am I working on?

430
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,080
Hippo's got the most interesting shit going on.

431
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,680
Yeah, he does.

432
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,640
He doesn't want to talk about it.

433
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,760
He never speaks to it.

434
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,400
That speaks to that.

435
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,040
Well, I'll speak about it in private.

436
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,480
But I'm writing scripts, screenplay.

437
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
This competition has to happen a thousand times forever.

438
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
Where we're just like, Hippo, tell us about what you do.

439
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
And you say, well, I'm writing a script.

440
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,360
And we're like, holy shit.

441
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah.

442
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,240
It's great.

443
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,480
And then the episode goes by.

444
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,680
And we're like, Hippo, what the fuck are you doing?

445
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't get it still.

446
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,280
Still writing the screenplay.

447
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,360
Oh my god.

448
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,200
Wow.

449
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm writing dialogue.

450
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm doing stuff to make a potentially feature

451
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,600
film of 2D animation for families and young children.

452
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
I'm not a family, can I get it?

453
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,360
We have to clarify, this isn't an internet gay thing.

454
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,280
This is real life.

455
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Yeah, this is a real thing.

456
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,800
This is like non-gay.

457
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm freelance hired writer to do this.

458
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,680
Like the goal is for it to be on a network.

459
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,520
The goal is to be on a little bit more of a credible media

460
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
platform.

461
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,360
To be profitable enough so that it doesn't bankrupt anyone.

462
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,000
So that we make our money back and it'll be pretty good.

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
And people see it.

464
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,000
But mostly so that the people involved, me and the director

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,080
and the head of ART, the company I'm in at the moment,

466
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,880
it's just basically three people.

467
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
And I'm not really part of the company.

468
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,040
We're all just sort of freelance.

469
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,520
It's just like the director.

470
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,360
You get some equity, man.

471
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,800
The director, I'm the head writer.

472
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,720
And then there's like the ART guy.

473
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,440
And we're all working to put this.

474
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
I wish I was head writer on something.

475
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,000
Me too.

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
To put this.

477
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,760
Actually, I don't.

478
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,240
But I feel sorry for the opposition.

479
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,480
So that the company and each of us

480
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,440
could get a main recognition so that we can make more stuff.

481
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,280
Because that's how you do anything

482
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
is you are known by people.

483
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,400
So like we make it.

484
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,120
Exposure.

485
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah.

486
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,600
Yeah.

487
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,560
Exposure, there.

488
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,920
That's what I'm working on in the real world.

489
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,760
In the internet world, I'm doing a webcomic.

490
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,080
And it's pretty cool as well.

491
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,360
I don't really know what else.

492
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,280
I guess I quit YouTube, but I already talked about that.

493
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I don't know if you want to get on the show,

494
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
because it's so early in the planning.

495
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,560
But we were talking about this the other day of our Oost

496
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
accord.

497
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,640
And we might be working together on something, maybe,

498
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,760
if it pans out.

499
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Yeah.

500
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
I think it's so fucking cool.

501
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,400
Wait, can you feel ever so slightly less vague?

502
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,560
So I know what you're talking about.

503
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
Something with jailbait.

504
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,720
Oh, I don't think I heard about that.

505
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,240
You said jailbait?

506
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,720
No.

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Something with jailbait.

508
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,280
Something with jailbait is involved.

509
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,440
That's what you write when it's like the NSFW,

510
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,600
like Undertale, but like an animal tail, like jailbait.

511
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,080
That's what you type in if you want the rule told you to hold it.

512
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,400
Obviously, you started out on YouTube in the internet as a whole.

513
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,160
What do you want your ideal balance

514
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
to be between those two worlds?

515
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Because obviously, we all think that the real world stuff

516
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,920
is super fucking neat and cool.

517
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,520
But you love the internet as much as we want you to be on.

518
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,800
Well, it's not like I don't love the real world.

519
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Sure.

520
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Because I have no writing experience

521
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,040
beyond what I've done for this gig, this writing gig.

522
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,360
So I've learned a lot very quickly,

523
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,600
because you get exposed through people talking about things

524
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
and you read books that they recommend.

525
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,520
And then I know more than I did.

526
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,840
But it feels scary, because I didn't go to college for that.

527
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,680
I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm figuring it out.

528
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:51,440
And once the fruits of my labor start becoming real things,

529
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,600
I can show people rather than just like,

530
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
yeah, a couple of years down the line,

531
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,840
or maybe the film will be in production.

532
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,200
Well, there's a video, right?

533
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,280
There's a trailer.

534
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,480
They can't, no.

535
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,200
The trailer's secret, and no one can see it.

536
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
Well, because it's not the final trailer.

537
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,720
But this is just an idea.

538
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,040
No, it's just fine.

539
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,000
They can know that there's a secret trailer,

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because it's cool and mysterious, but they can't see it.

541
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,720
Link in the description.

542
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

543
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

544
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,880
So what do you want the balance to be?

545
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
Other balance?

546
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,640
Like what would you just want to do,

547
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
like have this be your job, because it's

548
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,080
fulfilling in a lot of ways to you.

549
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,280
and then come home and then make a comic page or to a day?

550
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Um, all the balance, yeah, in terms of work, I want the writing to be, like, I don't want to

551
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,360
let it slip by, like, I don't want to be like, oh, there's this thing I could be doing, I could

552
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:57,160
be writing, but, you know, I'm more interested in this, like, stuff that is, like, less immediately

553
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,360
viable, like, if I'm tied to someone else's work who is also trying to make it real and work.

554
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,320
Then it's like, it's more likely that that's going to be a thing and that's going to make me

555
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,480
money and then that's going to further, like, make me money in the future. So it's, like,

556
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,720
a better investment of time. So I want to work hard on that right now.

557
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,120
Big industry, dude.

558
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,760
Are you waiting to say that?

559
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,560
True. It is a big industry.

560
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,800
Pipo's got that big industry energy.

561
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:39,080
And, like, fucking, um, the writing, I wanted to be, like, 70% or maybe 80%. Like, the stuff

562
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,320
that I was doing on YouTube, it always felt like a hobby, even though I was trying to make it a

563
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,200
real thing. It's just, like, I could never give a shit enough about it. The webcomic stuff is,

564
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,640
like, more fun and I enjoy that a lot more than the YouTube stuff, but it still feels like a hobby

565
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,360
because I'm, like, I'm still, I don't feel like I'm good enough at drawing to be, like, you know,

566
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:04,040
making people, like, turn heads or whatever. But, like, doing the writing stuff, I would be getting

567
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,600
better at writing in general, so, like, my comics will improve. So, like, maybe it'll be, like,

568
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,440
I don't know, it just depends on, like, who gives a shit about the, the, the, the hobby

569
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,120
comic stuff. Do you see yourself becoming a fully offline creator? Do you see yourself

570
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,920
becoming, like, like, a writer by trade and online and that stuff? Or, or is the goal always to

571
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:31,960
become an internet patron of man? The goal, I think, is just to be a hybrid. Okay. Yeah. Like, I don't,

572
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,040
I don't see, like, it used to be you're either an internet guy because you're young or a real guy

573
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,600
because you're older and the internet wasn't really around while you were growing up. But, like,

574
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:49,640
there's more people now that are in the industry from, like, doing internet stuff, like me. Like,

575
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,200
they made DVNR accounts and people hired them because, like, they liked their art.

576
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,840
Like a sugar and whatnot. Yeah. And, like, Lauren Faust as a DVNR, Faust as a DVNR as well.

577
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,320
It's like, um, internet and it's like, you can have both. I can be known as, like, the guy who

578
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,240
writes the thing or I can be probably more well known as the guy who writes that comic.

579
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,240
And I get money for both, probably. Yeah. As long, like, as long as your work's getting out there

580
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,080
in one form or another, right? Dude, that's me. Nice. That's like you as a Muppet. Yeah, he's got

581
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,720
Muppet Nose Syndrome. There we go. Yes, that's what I'm doing. Thank you for taking

582
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,520
my everyday deuce interview with me. I hope you've enjoyed this wonderful evening. I asked this

583
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,520
because my mind's been completely in, like, my future as these are the, like, the, like, literally,

584
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,560
like, as we speak, the final days before I'm applying to college and if I don't get into any of

585
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,520
the ones that I applied to this year, it's real sad a little bit. So I've been thinking about,

586
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,600
you know, my future, if I get it, if I don't get in my, my path in life, what I want to do this year

587
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:08,440
in general. And so I've just been interested in these, I felt this way more or less for a couple

588
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,920
years now, but really it's sunken now. But I always feel like I'm on the precipice of something,

589
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,920
not just me personally. I know that feel, bro. Yeah. Yeah. I used to constantly say that phrase,

590
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,080
like, oh, I'm like on the cusp. Yeah. I always felt like, oh, I'm on the cusp. And a lot of the

591
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,920
times I was on the cusp, and then I crossed the cusp into a new cusp. Yeah. It's like you're,

592
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,320
oh, I'm on the cusp of 100,000 subs. And then I hit that. And then I'm like, oh, now I'm on the cusp

593
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,040
of 200,000 subs. And it's like, at some point, there must be some cusp that you round. And then

594
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,320
you go, I'm satisfied with having crossed this cusp. I don't need to cross another cusp. Do

595
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,320
you think it's possible? Do you think that's like a real thing? I think you're always going to want

596
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,240
to get to the next stage of something no matter what. You always want to be making progress.

597
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,960
Imagine if you retire, but you're still like a cabbage farmer. You're going to be like,

598
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,280
I want to farm these cabbages even fucking harder. Even if you don't get out of your

599
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,200
field, professional field, you're always going to want to get to a new cusp of something. Right.

600
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,960
For me, the thing that I want to do the most is I want to be able to work on more things that

601
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,240
aren't for-profit strictly by having the things that I work on that are for-profit make more

602
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,840
profit for less effort. So I want my for-profit ventures to reach a point where I have found the

603
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,920
perfect balance. Because with my main channel, for instance, it's always been for-profit and also

604
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,080
for-passion. And so it was always about getting better, covering material I wanted to cover and

605
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,960
stuff. But I reached a point where the things I sincerely want to do are not going to make my

606
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:55,720
channel more profitable. Just doing whatever I want, doing what would suit me best is not to

607
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,880
say that a type of video that I would super want to do wouldn't be successful, but just I don't

608
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,960
necessarily want to just do video. I like doing music a lot. I like working on other projects

609
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,880
that are just weird or not marketable. And so I still am not making as much money as I want to

610
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,760
be. So it's like, how can I make it so I can take time away from my main channel to go work on these

611
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,320
other things without that meaning that I no longer have the standard of living I want to reach?

612
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,960
So the biggest reason I've put so much egg in the basket of me and Nate doing a show together,

613
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,880
for instance, is that I think he and I could do a show that as long as the setup is perfect,

614
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,000
if everything is in its right place and all we have to do is just deliver, then it's a type of

615
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,360
content I can imagine being good for less effort in the individual production. Where me and Nate

616
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,480
just having a conversation can be an entertaining piece of media. And if it's well made, if it's

617
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,920
like well structured, then, you know, I think people would like it. And then like, if that's

618
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,120
where all our income comes from, I don't have to worry about making four main channel videos a month

619
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,840
or, you know, a certain number of Patreon exclusive podcasts or whatever, it could just be like, hey,

620
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,760
I go to work to do this fun video project, and the videos are good and people like them. And then I

621
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:26,360
go home and I just make weird songs and fucking learn to draw and write a book or something, you

622
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,560
know. Do we pay the editors enough to have them cut out things if we don't want to be in the podcast?

623
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Yes, we do. Would you say it's fair that you are maybe not banking on this show taken off,

624
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,280
but you are putting most of your effort into the show you're doing with Nate? And do you think

625
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:58,280
that, how do I phrase this? Do you think that if this show does not take off or does not

626
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,360
succeed, you're going to be in deep shit? No, the opposite will be true, because-

627
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,800
It'll be way better than I expected. This is basically like a producer's sort of scam, like a

628
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:15,240
smoke screen. Well, like, like part of, this is part of why we're trying to talk about moving

629
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:22,440
somewhere cheaper. Like, where I am now, I kind of am in that kind of circumstance where it's like,

630
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,040
if I was putting my all into something me and Nate were doing and we lived here and it didn't

631
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,960
work out, then it would be like, it would be, you know, harsher. But like, no matter how much work

632
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,200
I put into the thing I do with Nate, I still have the main channel. I still can do four videos a

633
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,680
month on it and make money, you know. And at this stage, like what's keeping that channel alive

634
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,040
is like, I just write a bunch of scripts and I send them to DeVoo and he edits them at whatever

635
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,440
rate he can and that frees me up to explore alternative business ventures. So like, that's

636
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,600
where I Am Games comes in. Like, I've probably spent more time on I Am Games than I have on my

637
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,920
main channel in the last three months. It just isn't as instantly profitable, but like, you know,

638
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,360
it is growing. So it's always like this weird constant like min-maxing of trying to figure out

639
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,480
like what can I do that will that will add profit to my life without taking away time for me to just

640
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,320
live and do what I want to do, you know, like what what business ventures will make me more money,

641
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,280
but I can still make an album every month or whatever.

642
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,160
There's a question I've been thinking about for a while and I've contemplated it myself,

643
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,080
being somebody who does YouTube and has a job. How much sense does it make to position yourself

644
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,480
as a YouTuber such that your primary focus is to basically clock in for your like, you know,

645
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,600
nine to five, like four days a week. Yeah, doing your YouTube show that like is your for-profit,

646
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,280
you have to do it. It's like you're there to be profitable as and then like and then you're spare.

647
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,920
Oh, now I get to do the funds. Well, I mean, at least you've got creative control. I mean,

648
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,400
that's a huge thing. That's a huge thing. I mean, the kind of show that we are playing that we're

649
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,400
trying to do is fun to do. Like, I agree. It's a type of show that I like watching and I like

650
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,360
creating. Like, I love red letter media. It's like, yeah, fucking half of the thing I consume on

651
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,680
YouTube. Please don't call it red letter media ripoff. It makes you sound so gay.

652
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,160
Just call it pleaven the weave with you and me, please. The pleaven the weave was founded as a

653
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,640
red letter media ripoff. Of course. That was the idea. It's all just a degrees of separation. It's

654
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,240
out of degrees of separation. I mean, I consider about not making us not sound like

655
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,120
if you ask me to describe the Digi Bro channel, I would say, oh, it's an ego wrapped ripoff or

656
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,760
it's a Mr. Plinkett ripoff. Like we've done videos in the voices. Like my biggest video series is

657
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,000
called Your Anime Sucks. It is a YMS ripoff. Like, I don't find anything wrong with that because

658
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,040
all creativity is a ripoff. Okay. I understand. I feel you. I think it's doing something that's

659
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,160
not a ripoff. All I'm saying is that I think you could describe the show in more flattering

660
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,000
to me. I mean, it's good. It's not just that. The reason I like to describe it that way is that

661
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,960
like that to me is like a really intense promise because like nobody does higher quality versions

662
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,840
of this style of content than red letter media to say we're doing a red letter media ripoff.

663
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,240
Like we're going to it's like saying we're going to hit that level of quality and that to me,

664
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,800
if somebody tells me I want to make a video that level, then I think, oh, shit, like that's serious.

665
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,320
Ripoff is not a flattering term whatsoever. It's extremely like derivative. I mean, well, yeah.

666
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,160
Everything's extremely derivative. I used that wrong. I used that word wrong. I mean, it's bad.

667
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:47,560
Derogatory. That's what I was thinking. Yeah. Anyway, I'm not even honest. I don't even give a

668
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,520
shit. Like if everybody thinks it's a shillgasm, then whatever. Like all that matters is when the

669
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,920
episodes come out, if they're entertaining, I don't give a fuck if you literally think it is a

670
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,560
straight ripoff. If you watch it and you like it, that is what matters, you know?

671
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,640
It's not like red letter media fucking invented the two man talking.

672
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,960
Sure. No. It's just Teebacked that. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Fuck yeah. We're

673
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,280
going to go back, dude. So almost there. The biggest things that will set us apart is we have a very,

674
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,960
like obviously we're going to bring our unique aesthetic, our unique approach to comedy and

675
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,720
who's ours. Whoever's involved. Anybody who happens to be on the show, just like with

676
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,560
Pleeve and the Weed, where it was me and Jesse's unique voices and then everybody else who got

677
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,640
involved, every guest episode had some of that person in it. The episode with Munchy is a very

678
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,360
Munchy take on the Pleeve and the Weed. God, I wish it wasn't.

679
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:57,880
It's old Munchy. Very, very 2018 Munchy. Oh yeah, 2018. Back in the day.

680
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah. Completely different. Now I'm only quiet Munchy. What's up guys? Quiet Munchy is back

681
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:10,520
for this episode. Just wanted to say that I'm having a good time. My mom's upstairs and doesn't

682
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,320
want to hear me recording. She says I'm banned from recording on the PCP if I'm doing it secretly.

683
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,520
What's up guys? It's me, daddy. I'm here to record a daddy rap. My actual real life father is

684
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,200
upstairs and he can't know that I have a daddy's fashion or something like that. Or else he might

685
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,360
be too happy and decided to do stuff that even I won't go to. We better just not open that can of worms.

686
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,160
Talking about Digi, talking about being the cusp of things. I guess just like future stuff is on

687
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:47,400
the mind and I want to know how everyone is doing because I feel like, I mean, I don't know, what

688
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,560
tale is all this time? We don't talk that much in the PCP chat. We do way more than we used to.

689
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,480
But I mean, I feel like I know what Ben is up to. I feel like me and Ben hang out. We have our own

690
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,880
venues. Yeah. I mean, I just assume everybody knows what I'm up to because it's always the same thing.

691
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,640
I have no idea. You know what I'm, what do you think I'm doing? Well, I guess what you just told me

692
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,360
just now. I mean, well, that's like future plans. But like, what do you think I'm doing? I think

693
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,760
you're sitting in your room and you're writing all day for anime reviews. That's not even slightly

694
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,200
close to true. Okay. Well, I don't know. I write maybe an anime review like three days out of the

695
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:36,280
month. Okay. I spend a lot of time on I Am Games and just having living life. I mean, I spend a lot

696
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,600
of time watching anime for a finish or no finish or fail. Yeah, finish or fail. Hey, wait, Digi,

697
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,800
you paid me $100. Do you not want to use the intro? Is something wrong with it? Like? Oh,

698
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,720
that was the intro for the other for like the the main channel version of finish or fail,

699
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,360
which I canceled because it costed a lot of money and didn't get any views. Okay. So you're just

700
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,080
going to not use that? I mean, I could. I didn't even think about it. Like, I literally never even

701
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,280
considered. I'm not scorned. I'm just saying get your money's worth out of me. You're absolutely

702
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,160
right. I just never thought about it at all. But uh, yeah, I'll do it. I'll put it in there.

703
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,800
So hard to make. Going back slowly to the topic I was saying before, I'm just wondering for my

704
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,000
future plans, if one day I'm making weaguas and I'm just like, man, I sure hate making these. Sure,

705
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,840
don't enjoy doing this job that I have to do to live. And I guess I'm wondering if

706
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,560
if youtubers are way too spoiled and whiny babies, because like I go to my job, I go to my job five

707
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,800
days a week and I put in my hours, like whatever, more than eight hours or whatever every fucking day.

708
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,840
And like, it's it's nice that I can my job is that I can't really leave it at the door. I have to

709
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,680
check emails and be on top of stuff. It's a real professional job. But like, to a degree, you can

710
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,560
kind of leave things there and you can leave. I feel like I don't want to give youtubers too much

711
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,840
fucking shit. But I do feel like the burnout rate, just specifically in the sense of like,

712
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,600
you're still doing your stuff, but you're just like, man, this sucks. I don't want to do it. And

713
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,000
then things just take longer to come out. The fucking the weird thing about youtubers is that like,

714
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,600
you make up yourself what your obligations are. That's true. And something I've been trying to do,

715
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,040
and this is kind of like my it was sort of my resolution going into the new year, was that I

716
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,320
wasn't going to like, meme myself into believing I had to do any particular thing. Because like,

717
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,440
I'll get it in my head where I'll be like, Oh, I have to do a video about like this type of show

718
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,640
or this length or this whatever. And like, I have to launch this venture and like, at the end of the

719
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,720
day, like, what succeeds or fails is so like up to chance. And so like, there's predictable elements

720
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,280
to it. But like, what people will want from me. Like, you know, maybe I make a video that is about

721
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,840
like the newest show. And I talk about it for 35 minutes. And I'm analytical. I'm funny. And the

722
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:12,600
video gets 300,000 views. Probably I'll gain some patrons based on it. But also, maybe I like, release

723
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,280
some random song. And like, one guy's like, that's my favorite song, I'm pledging $40. And like,

724
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,760
that's a better return on investment. Right. And it was just something I wanted to do. You know,

725
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,720
so it's like, yeah. And this, this is kind of what happened to me last year was that like,

726
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,280
when I went monthly with my Patreon, the idea was that it was just you're paying for everything I do

727
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,080
on the internet. Yeah. And there were some people who like, I have patrons who don't even watch my

728
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,360
main channel content who are like, I don't give a fuck about anime. I don't care.

729
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,800
We're the hardest of the hardcore audience, the one deepest in your shit. Yeah. Like, if I go down

730
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,840
a route where I'm only trying to appeal to those guys, I start losing patrons who only care about

731
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,160
the main channel. And if I only do main channel videos, I start losing patrons. Like, there was

732
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,320
a period where it seemed like everybody was telling me they wanted me to do like, big, long,

733
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,000
serious videos again. So I went, okay, I spent like a whole month on this Makoto Shinkai video.

734
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,520
And like, it came out and people enjoyed it. But it like, it wasn't enough. Yeah. Because a lot

735
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,800
of my fans were like, well, you like, this was not worth losing you for a whole month. It wasn't

736
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,160
worth not getting my deluge of podcasts that I listen to every day or my all my random vlogs,

737
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,720
you know. So like, at the end of the day, I always have to strike a balance between these people.

738
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,800
And the best way to do that is to just do what makes sense in the moment, because everyone

739
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,480
responds to passion. Like everyone, I did these couple of boogie pop vlogs, because there's new

740
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,640
boogie pop anime started. And like, everybody who watched them was like, this is my favorite

741
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,160
listening to you talking about anime forever, because I clearly care a lot.

742
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,600
I didn't watch this yet. But I when I saw this, I immediately hit the spark of, oh, I bet did

743
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,960
you really give a shit about this? And I was like, watch these at some point. Anyone else?

744
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,520
I'm starting to feel like an icy draft blow across my, you are, you are shoeless. I am

745
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,760
shoeless. I'm most sockless. Do you want me to turn the heater on? I mean, it won't affect the

746
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,880
audio. I could, I could do it. Hey, I got it. I could do with the heater. Wait, wait, hold on.

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,960
I just want to say, I'm not texting anyone. I'm not sexting. Don't worry. I'm writing down notes

748
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,760
on my phone. So don't think I'm not paying attention, talking to the audience exclusively.

749
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,320
Cool. On, on this, this point of not meeting yourself into oblivion, I, I like that. And I was,

750
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,400
I've been thinking about that recently. And that's kind of what I've done. Like, uh, uh, but like,

751
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,400
if I wanted to, if I was so inclined, I could announce today, guys, uh, just letting you know,

752
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,080
not making the ghost in the shell video, just letting you know, it's not happening. I'm doing

753
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,000
other things. If I did that, that's going to be a sound bite. What would be the real consequences

754
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,760
of that? A few people would probably be a little grumpy and maybe a few like hardcore fans would

755
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,240
feel jilted and might like unpledged. But my channel has grown beyond this like promise I made

756
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,760
years ago. I'm still going to make it. But I, when I think about like people, this is fascinating

757
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,680
to me. I think so many YouTubers box themselves into a corner with their, and just like,

758
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,320
they didn't even plan to get there, but where they find themselves in, they feel trapped.

759
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,320
And honestly, I don't even blame them. I think this is some sort of weird psychological prison

760
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,480
we built ourselves. I will say this, that like, I've put myself in a position where people do

761
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,800
get mad at me for canceling projects just because I cancel so many projects. Because to me, it's like,

762
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,680
I have an idea for a huge series that if it does succeed, I will go through this whole series.

763
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,680
But if I put out episode one and nobody gives a shit, then there's no reason to continue the

764
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,680
series. Like I created it under the impression it could be a huge success. So like, because I've

765
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,600
done that so many times, there are people who are like, you know, I start up a series and they're

766
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,200
like, I refuse to get excited about anything you're going to do. Maybe they don't like the,

767
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,720
I mean, if you make episode one of anything might not turn out as great as the idea could

768
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,040
potentially be flushed out to be. So maybe that's what the criticism is about. But sometimes it's

769
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,680
just like, sometimes like, for instance, with that finish or fail that you did the intro for,

770
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,880
like, I had written that in a relatively quick fashion thinking that it would be a one or two

771
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,120
week turnaround for editing. And it ended up being a whole month turnaround. And like, because of that,

772
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,080
it had the impression of Digi Bro didn't put out a video all month. And then because of that,

773
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:29,240
it only got it only got 60,000 views. And I was counting on it getting like 300,000 views. So

774
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,960
like, it was and I had poured a lot of money into it. So it was like, both the money and time.

775
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,880
It's like, I couldn't have afforded to do it again. If it was only if I was gonna have to wait for it

776
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,160
to build. So you're saying that in the end, you decided not to salvage the idea, but to slaughter.

777
00:42:45,160 --> 00:43:11,000
Is that actually canikers? Thanks to actually do this. Yeah, I heard it. I heard it. I didn't believe

778
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,440
it. But I heard it for myself. He has two little plastic no he has a plastic gun and like a price

779
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,240
checker. He's got a magic gun. Where'd he purchase that cat, Icarus. Link sling car. That's the joke.

780
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,560
That's the joke. Tectonic improv. We were listening to Digi. Hey, I think a lot of people who might

781
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,800
not be in the Digi sphere, but in the journal piece of piece here, because I'm sure you've explained

782
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,320
this in Patreon podcasts and stuff like that. I'm sure a lot of people will want to know, like,

783
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:47,240
what the fuck was up with like being so weird and weird all the time. What if you mean like with

784
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,480
the weird like visuals in my videos? No, no, no, not like that. But I mean, like, making all like,

785
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,960
like, dude, we're fucking entering a new age, we're in the gecko estate, I'm gonna make all these

786
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,720
fucking high quality videos nonstop, you know, fucking a market marketing that marketing show,

787
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,440
how they marketed, fucking finish your fail, high average from now on, how they market a giant

788
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,480
so long fucking series for two fucking years, gonna go crazy, get ready for this shit, dude.

789
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:24,520
I have a YouTube thing, I have a YouTube thing to say Digi. Remember, I think it was a cool,

790
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:32,520
sorry, did I interrupt? No, fine, do it. Did I? Okay, do it. I think it was Digi does anime and

791
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,920
you put the footage in like a little tiny TV, like to get around copyright. That was just what

792
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,000
I was doing on my channel for like a year. Yeah, well, because it was the, it was before I realized

793
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,720
that you could just use 10 second clips. Well, I was making, I was making the Winnie the Pooh video,

794
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,880
and I tried, I used 10 second clips, but it's still got copyright claims. That's Disney shit.

795
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,320
Yeah, because that's Disney shit. So I had to use 10 second clips and put it in a tiny TV and

796
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,600
fuck with the contrast and brightness and put over like a static overly video effects on it,

797
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,440
just to get around copyright protection and have it, and have it monetizable.

798
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,160
And people in the comments were like, nice, nice Digi bro, Digi does anime reference, dude.

799
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,880
And I'm like, no, no, this is art out Digi. This is art out of adversity. I would never.

800
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, okay, so Digi, you can see a silly sigh, just what the fuck was with avant-garde Digi

801
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,120
trying to do weird, like, hugely ambitious projects for a while and then just like stop

802
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,880
literally moved to Boston and lost all my money. Okay.

803
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:41,240
Well, because like last it was it started last year last December. I was like, I had been doing

804
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:48,360
just like nonstop deluge of small content. And some people liked it, some people didn't. And like,

805
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,280
people were like demanding that I start making like more meaningful shit again. So I was like,

806
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,800
okay, I'm going to make bigger, better videos. And I made a couple. And then I had an idea for

807
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,000
like, because like I had rewatched like a bunch of Jesse's videos, like the whole horseshoe

808
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,600
saga, I rewatched like a bunch of demolition D videos. And like, basically, I was like, man,

809
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,480
I really want to do more with the medium of video, like I don't want my stuff to just be

810
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,160
because my usual style is I just write a script, like without the impression it's going to be a

811
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,480
video. Like I just write it like an anime blog post like I used to back in the day. And then I

812
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:29,560
send it to DeVu and he edits it. And like he can go really crazy with the editing if he wants to,

813
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:35,400
or if I like, you know, request that this video be like really, you know, over the top. But like,

814
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,600
I wanted it to be better integrated stuff like stuff that was made for video that made sense

815
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:49,320
best as video. And so like the best idea I had of like, how can I talk about anime in a way

816
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,440
that will stay interesting will allow me to talk about big popular shows without having to review

817
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,840
them. But like I can talk about their history and like interesting stuff about them. So how they

818
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:05,080
marketed the whole idea was like, I can talk about Attack on Titan or something, and it's not an

819
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,960
Attack on Titan review, it's how they marketed Attack on Titan. And then I talk about the marketing

820
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,040
and then the way I would market the show was that each show I talked about,

821
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,880
I would market my video the same way the show was marketed. So the whole gimmick was supposed to be

822
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,720
that like, if for instance, there was a show where it had like a heavy Twitter presence,

823
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,000
then I would make a Twitter for this video and like do something similar to what they had done

824
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,200
that I talked about in the video. And the main thing that this all hinged on was that episode

825
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,160
two was supposed to be about Pop Team Epic. And Pop Team Epic marketed itself by having a whole

826
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:45,480
like ton of different artists contribute like short pieces to the show. And like all of it was

827
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,200
like stuff that could survive as Twitter video or as gifts. So like there was tons and tons of

828
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,520
people posting like three minute clips from Pop Team Epic on Twitter. And the show was created

829
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,360
as a marketing gimmick. Like that was the idea. They looked at this comic and they said we could

830
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,200
do all kinds of marketing experiments with it. So I was going to make that the second episode

831
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,520
of how they marketed the first one was more to explain basic marketing principles. And then

832
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,560
the second one would just be like utterly insane. And I was going to hire all of you to do parts for

833
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,280
it like hire everybody I knew to do like little three minute bits and then market it heavily

834
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,280
through Twitter and all this shit. And like it was going to be this big sprawling thing to just

835
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,560
have popular content that's actually good. Like it was just how can I make something that's both

836
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,280
good and will be successful by marketing it. So yeah, I started working on it. But the thing is

837
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,760
that episode one took too long to make partly because I got involved in several other big

838
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,760
projects at the same time where I started making a documentary and I started doing this other

839
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,520
shit and I was looking for a house. So it was like I just didn't put enough time into getting

840
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:57,880
episode one out the out the door. And then when I moved it was like I lost so much patronage

841
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,280
from the amount of time I had spent like working on all these big videos that I was like well

842
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,080
now I can't afford to take any more time away to work on big videos. I need to get the content

843
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,720
machine running again. So as soon as I moved in here I immediately launched the gecko estate

844
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,680
because the idea was these will be like hour and a half long videos that will appeal to my core fans

845
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,160
like the people who are unsubbing right now, the people who are unpaturing, which funnily enough

846
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,280
while a lot of those people did like it some of them had just stopped following me in general.

847
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,840
And so they just didn't even watch those videos like so there was no opportunity to like bring

848
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,960
those people back into the fold because they just weren't even paying attention.

849
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,760
But like you know so that was my first plan and then I was like oh my god living here

850
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,400
is expensive and I still haven't paid my taxes. I need to just work on making money for a while.

851
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,560
So then I was like now I'm gonna make fucking all populist videos and like

852
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,240
when how they marketed episode one was complete I just didn't like it enough. Like I didn't think

853
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,560
it was worth posting or continuing because it wasn't at the level of quality I wanted it to be on

854
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:05,000
because it was supposed to be an expensive venture. Like I was going to buy materials to build sets

855
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,080
and to like you know have poster arrays and have like people's art in it and like that was why you

856
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:17,240
know like for Finish or Fail I hired both you and Tom like I think 50 bucks a piece to do art for it

857
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:24,040
and like what did Tom do? Tom made a CG can of beer that I used very briefly at various parts of

858
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:29,560
the video because that one of the shows like the Finish or Fail ending has a preview for how they

859
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:36,440
marketed and one of the shows was like a show made as a marketing campaign for beer. So I had Tom

860
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,760
make me a beer to like show the way that they had done it you know. Anyway point being that like I

861
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,240
was intending to spend a lot of money on it and then when I couldn't spend money on it like when I

862
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,120
didn't have the money to spend it just meant the show wasn't gonna be what I imagined. And so like

863
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,440
by the time I could have even started on episode two I couldn't have paid a bunch of artists to

864
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,280
work on it if it was going to be Potthym Epic. Potthym Epic wasn't relevant anymore so it wasn't

865
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,920
going to be like real flash video. Right. So what you're saying is may ruin your content.

866
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,120
Got it. Thank you for validating my theories all along.

867
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,120
Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao.

868
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,840
Do you think that the hello market could come back when you have more money?

869
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,000
I mean I basically just came to the conclusion that the only way it would be possible is with a

870
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,040
Kickstarter campaign behind it. Like it would have to be funded up front because no matter what

871
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:37,320
it's going to be expensive and it's like it's just not it's not worth the turnaround like what I like

872
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:43,480
it was born out of this existential ennui of like I want to do content that will succeed but I also

873
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,480
want to do content I will personally think it's good. Watching demolition D videos will do that too.

874
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,800
Even though I really only think that he had like a couple of great videos towards the end of his

875
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,960
career like he was getting better and better. He retired right after he made like the best videos

876
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,520
he had done and then it was just like he's gone. I have two questions. First one just just to know.

877
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,800
So what you're saying is is that you're you were going to make all these crazy videos and then you

878
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,560
ran out of money and so you didn't and it just is like that's over and yeah it's pretty much I mean

879
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,400
it's just it couldn't it was no longer feasible and it still is not feasible. Okay okay sick all right

880
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,720
I want to know specifically what was the inspiration behind the the meme of marketing like this marketing

881
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:36,120
because marketing is a way to like I was looking at how does marketing like lost like all meaning

882
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,400
because it was used like in every single sentence you ever said for like months. Well yeah it was

883
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,080
it was a meme. The point of it was to create a meme that would make that was the marketing. Okay okay

884
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:52,920
my attempt to market the show was to constantly remind people of the show and just say how they

885
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,000
marketed how they marketed how they marketed as a series of the narrative how they marketed a series

886
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,360
of the narrative like you would just get it in your head and you would have to fucking see the

887
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,240
thing at that point you know. I mean that's what marketing is. When it dropped. Just repeat yourself

888
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,480
constantly. When the when how they marketed dropped I was like oh it's that thing it's that thing I've

889
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,080
heard. Yeah I've heard this and what is it. Wait wait wait does this brand have merchandise?

890
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:21,960
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. It has branding. It has the market. It has content. It has the other one that

891
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,240
starts with an M. Marketing. What was actually released was not like what episode one like I

892
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:33,000
stripped off the first like seven minutes of it that was like all because like originally the first

893
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,440
part of the video is all just establishing context of like what like how shows are marketed in

894
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,840
general. It was like all live action so it was like all these parts of me like using whiteboards

895
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,720
and stuff to explain. Does that exist anywhere in the world? Yeah well I haven't posted it online

896
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,360
yet. At the end of that video I'm like become a patron and you'll be able to see the uh the

897
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:58,040
uncut version and I never put that version together. Boy make that I want to see that intro. I want to

898
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,840
see the director's cut. It's like six it's like six minutes but the audio was not very good and

899
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,400
like we had just moved in so the house is weirdly barren and like it just looked and sounded like

900
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,040
shit and like DeVu I had thought like because I was doing a style at the time where I was occasionally

901
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,040
doing heavily edited vlogs or like I would just talk into the camera but then I would add tons of

902
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,280
shit on time. Was wearing an onion on my belt. That was the style at the time. I had expected it to

903
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,520
be like that but when I sent it to DeVu he didn't really add that much to that section and the stuff

904
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,480
he did add was like weird and jarring because I just didn't give him enough direction I guess.

905
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,640
So just that whole section I hated it and like he had finished it like almost two months before

906
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,320
I released it. I just was like well this is this I don't even want to look at it because I'm so

907
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,280
disappointed with it and I still had to do all those commercials that are in there which were

908
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,880
all just patron backer rewards so like so anything weird about the video is because it's not the

909
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,360
video it was supposed to be like it would have made sense but like because I'd already given up on

910
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,760
it it was just kind of like let's cut this thing in such a way that I can ship it out and then never

911
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,240
have to think about it again. Dan it's interesting because we always make fun of like producers who

912
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,880
do those things with movies. It's usually out of necessity you know. Yeah of course like nobody

913
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,960
wants to make like a bad movie I'm not even saying it was a bad video or anything but yeah I still

914
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:24,440
liked it. I still wish there was a number two. There could be in the future but it would be like

915
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,320
the approach I had because I had like a huge list of shows I was going to do and it was going to end

916
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:35,480
in like a three-part like film length like movie that was going to be How They Marketed Digi Bro

917
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,480
so like well there was going to be How They Marketed How They Marketed and then How They Marketed

918
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,600
Digi Bro. Oh the ultimate how they marketed when you kill yourself and then as a martyr as a

919
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,160
sacrificial artist that's the ultimate marketing tool. Why do you remember Van Gogh? Because he was

920
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:57,400
like gay or something right? Well the ultimate sacrifice being gay. He must have. I think he

921
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,280
did kill. I know he cut off his ear. I think he killed himself. I thought he died if I could

922
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,280
disease him. Because he only ever saw one painting two his like brother-in-law and I'm pretty sure

923
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,520
he killed himself. I'm not sure. He might I'm not sure Hemingway killed himself. There's him.

924
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,160
Yeah yeah yeah. What he's most known for is killing himself. David Foster Wallace if that even

925
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,760
is his real name. He killed himself. Hunter S. Thompson killed himself. Why Hunter S. Thompson

926
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:26,440
do it? I'm going to kill myself. Okay. He was like no. He was in his 70s but like if you watch videos

927
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,120
of him at the time. Guys if you need if you need to talk to someone call the suicide hall. His life

928
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,680
style had taken a toll on him. Yeah right. Didn't seem like life was probably that enjoyable. Girls

929
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:41,560
if you want to commit suicide call my number stand. I'll be out dude. But uh apparently like Hunter

930
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,600
Thompson had said at some point that like the one thing that kept him like that kept him going was

931
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,920
knowing that at the very least he had power over his own life that like he could like knowing he

932
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,800
could kill himself at any time was like a source of strength for him. Okay. And then one day he just

933
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,920
fucking was like well I'm tired. Time to catch this check I've been writing for the last 20 years.

934
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:07,160
Well I mean it's 70. Not bad. Yeah not bad. I think he was in his 70s. So I feel like it's

935
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,320
probably pretty uncommon for people to kill themselves at that age. I feel like most most

936
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,560
suicides are probably younger people. Most suicides aren't older people. Really? Yeah.

937
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,640
Yeah. Old people kill themselves. I mean it's probably like a spike at youth and then like a

938
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,800
low or whatever. I mean it's like when you're young even if you fuck up your life really bad

939
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,400
you're like well at least I'm young. And you're also like physically resilient and more likely to

940
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,240
survive the attempt. I think also yeah Thomas like yeah I mean old people falling in the back

941
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:43,240
knocking the door down. Thank you fucking god. Okay what would it be fair to say that instead of

942
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,320
trying to do all these these big big budget blockbusters you're trying to settle down and

943
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,040
make things work which have already proven themselves. Like right now I'm just like running

944
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:00,200
every imaginable get rich quick scheme I can. It's not about getting rich quick though it's about

945
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,720
how does this sustain a long term business model. Maybe that's what you mean though.

946
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:11,880
But like yeah okay get rich in the long term. Yeah yeah it is. Like for instance something

947
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,240
me and Tom have been working a lot towards is defining alternative revenue sources. So like

948
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:25,960
doing things like selling merch or like more intimate products because like the videos themselves

949
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:32,120
it's like it's hard to define what people want or what they're like how do you tell somebody

950
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:37,640
like what your videos are worth or like something one guy might think that the main channel video

951
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,400
I spent a month on sucked and he doesn't care. And then the next guy is like oh this uh this

952
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,280
like three minute video of you just like ranting about something is my favorite thing you've ever

953
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:54,040
made. So it's like it always comes down to just like this vague sense that people pledge because

954
00:58:54,040 --> 00:59:01,080
they just kind of like me in general and or like the way things are going but like if you're selling

955
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:08,600
a t-shirt then it's like the t-shirt is worth $20. If you pay for it you get the t-shirt you know.

956
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,800
And so like having those less complicated things mixed up in it is it's comforting to know that

957
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,000
there's like a product you've assigned a value to people are paying that that amount to get that thing

958
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,760
and there's no questions about it there's no like feelings involved it's just like buy things you

959
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,920
like you know. I do like Patreon has always been like a weird model uh yeah yeah but we've talked

960
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:36,520
about that before. And also just like you know a lot of a lot of our reliance on Patreon has always

961
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,400
come down to like the most hardcore people will pledge the most money but like you can also just

962
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,080
get people to give you money for things like a lot of a lot of those hardcore fans while they

963
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,600
like because it's such a weird and vague sense of like how much a video is worth they just

964
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,520
basically pledge whatever they think they can afford long term. Yeah. Whereas if you sell them

965
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:04,280
something they might even pay you like like let's say we made a t-shirt every month there are some

966
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,400
people who might only pledge like two dollars on Patreon but because there is a concrete product

967
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,200
and they want to support us it's like oh I'll give you $20 every time you make a new shirt

968
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,320
you know and that's basically a $20 Patreon you know. Yeah more like they just feel more

969
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,720
aggressive about it. Right exactly and there there are a lot of people who like don't even really

970
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,720
give us money but we'll buy products we sell. I'm sure yeah there's plenty of those. You know what's

971
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,280
always struck me as interesting though with the Patreon model it's the people who are the most

972
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,760
into you and feel like maybe they like I am not the kind of person who donates to anyone's Patreon

973
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,360
that's not who I am but my patrons obviously are and everyone's patrons are so I'm not trying

974
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,720
to shit on my patrons or anyone's patrons but like what the business model there relies on

975
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,000
attracting the people who are the most attracted to you and I immediately find that like a weird

976
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,160
relationship what I would much rather have is people who just generally kind of like me I would

977
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,840
rather have more of those than like the cult following who like really care because frankly

978
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,800
I can never have the kind of like one-on-one relationship that's kind of weirdly implied

979
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:17,320
by like being a patron or like part of a patron discord. I mean I wouldn't even call myself

980
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:23,160
sorry guys I don't think I'm friends with most of my patrons I think I'm associates or like we

981
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,440
communicate and I am acquaintances. I mean at least acquaintances. My patrons have like kind of a

982
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,680
general fear of me of my irons. That's what I want for them. Me too. Me too Digi patron heads.

983
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,560
Nate I always I've always liked about Patreon. I always I've always enjoyed the fact that

984
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,920
theoretically I could subsist on only a few people. Well you know I don't like it though.

985
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,160
I feel weird about people like I don't know like like you got like cam girls for example and cam girls

986
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,040
have a thing going on and I don't think youtubers who have patrons are too far away from a cam girl

987
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:05,160
especially me. Especially me. You got guys who give like thousands of dollars to some of these girls

988
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,320
or whatever and like that's obviously like a romantic thing and it's like they're doing it for

989
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:16,280
like a relationship almost and that's like weird and off-putting. Well to me I'm more than happy

990
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:22,440
and I genuinely want to have a relationship with the people following. I would consider many many

991
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,480
fans of me friends. I have an entire discord chat which Ben and hip are both in the golden

992
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,240
childhood founder. I would consider everyone and they're a friend and even some people who aren't

993
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,520
in there. I could name I could name drop easily dozens of people from our fck who I would consider

994
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:42,920
friends. Sure sure and who I like. I'm not saying I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with the way

995
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,160
you think I'm saying we think of things differently. Yeah and I feel the same way to a degree. Like

996
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,640
guys like Lee one of my biggest patrons he's been around for a long time. We get along quite well

997
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,160
we talk all the time I like my pager discord. I feel like it's weird to even quantify a relationship

998
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:01,480
that way but like I like him he's a patron but like there's this there's this monetary thing

999
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,040
that hangs over it that makes the whole thing a little bit strange not like a pure like friendship

1000
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:13,640
we met up and we broed out or whatever and frankly I kind of like a more corporatized

1001
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:19,160
sanitized thing or like honestly what it makes me think about is I feel like we are cultivating

1002
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,240
YouTube shooters like instead of school shooters it's like YouTube shooters we're like getting

1003
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,720
these people we're like teasing these people almost with like we're like people like me or

1004
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,920
whatever uh they're like because I don't know like I attract a certain kind of guy who's like

1005
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,240
alt-right migtail dangerous like my videos are like for basically past Nate as I feel like a lot

1006
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:46,440
of people make stuff to like fix their mistakes along their path so knowing who I was probably

1007
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:52,760
like lowly guys who are like you know uh don't know a lot of stuff about girls and or I don't know

1008
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:57,720
maybe see me as a little bit of a role model and stuff well how mark what this is a big-ass

1009
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:05,320
chapstick uh it's fucking it's blood orange flavor it's grunge I love it um hey this isn't a big

1010
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:13,080
thing did I just invaded I just invaded the girls podcast yeah yeah yeah I was a male presence

1011
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:18,840
invading a female space that's what they call rape my friend uh guilty as god

1012
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,720
anyway just like red country you'll be able to fucking sync the videos together you can

1013
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:31,560
find the part in your stream where ben did that and check out yeah so yeah watch it watch them on

1014
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:37,400
two monitors they are live they're live on um fuck what's like what's your youtube yeah yeah the

1015
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,440
how the cropping cropping your kids oh they're your kids okay what's cool uh I I completely

1016
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,160
understand the want to have like like what did you say as well like a product you put out

1017
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:52,280
they're paying for that I'm into building walls my yeah exactly that being strong beautiful strong

1018
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:57,160
walls make good neighbors they do unironically why do you even have a picture just why not just

1019
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,880
say like there are no rewards this is just unironically so that people will pledge me more

1020
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,520
because they feel like they can get closer so I am absolutely yeah you're inviting this myself

1021
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,920
absolute tap dance on that line of it that's correct no I've completely crossed the line I'm way

1022
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,880
past uh yeah but I mean I mean I never would have known what it's like unless I try it so I mean you

1023
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,680
know uh I'm not saying I'm gonna shut it down or anything I have no intention to I'm just the

1024
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:26,360
relationship is interesting I frankly don't understand people who give money to people online

1025
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:32,120
because I don't and I never have I mean I patron although you know what I'll say I almost even

1026
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:36,680
you've been patroning me for a dollar a month for like two years meaning you've given me like

1027
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:43,320
$20 and I appreciate that I've been patroning you five dollars like a million billion years

1028
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,200
when I find myself in a situation where I can get a thing for free you got your you got your name

1029
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,960
in the video you got your name in the poo video in the credits at the end what am I gonna choose

1030
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:58,680
between free and paid like there is no choice I just well go to the free option maybe it's like

1031
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,600
for a lot of people yeah we we make content that they like and it's like you know what you can you

1032
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,160
read one piece for free but you'll buy volumes every now and then or you know like because you

1033
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,440
like it that much I mean I from well let me say let me say this I'm a little bit of an idiot and

1034
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,240
just talking out of my ass because I actually was very tempted the other day to pledge to nexus mania

1035
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,600
as the only person I've ever been even tempted to patron to because he just seems like such a hard

1036
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,400
worker and deserves good things in his life true and for that brief moment when I didn't actually

1037
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:37,240
pledge I sort of understood I believe a lot of it is like a sense of like be the change you want to

1038
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,480
see in the world because that's always how I've approached it is like I patron people because

1039
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:49,400
I want this type of content to feel as though it can continue yes you know it's like I I see like

1040
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,560
someone like me um you know I have a even if I talk about a lot of popular things and even if my

1041
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:01,240
opinions are shared by a lot of people I generally have unpopular opinions yeah and like yeah if you

1042
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:08,520
want to be like you know really really popular sorry usually pays to have the popular opinions

1043
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:15,000
yes so if people are like hey you have an unpopular opinion that I share I want to make sure that you

1044
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,200
are able to keep having your voice heard then like that's usually why and they'll they'll give to

1045
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,400
something like that and like most of the people who I would ask if they're not doing it for a reward

1046
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,640
tier like if they're just giving money with with that they don't care about the rewards it's almost

1047
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:36,920
always some kind of like yeah I want to prove a point by like giving money to this I think it for

1048
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,720
me I want to align myself with this that too for me I don't pledge to a lot currently but I want

1049
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,720
to pledge to way more for me it's as simple as I mean what everyone says at the end of the video

1050
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:53,720
if like it's content please yeah that's why I've been a long time patron of Japanese emoticons

1051
01:07:53,720 --> 01:08:00,040
yeah me that's true uh there's I use their services and I appreciate the what they bring

1052
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,400
to the table culturally there are many small youtubers with small patreons small penises

1053
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,680
and small penises as well that I genuinely think you know there's a good chance if this person

1054
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,800
doesn't make money and they'll just stop these people are making content which I love and I watch

1055
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:23,400
like every week do I want that to stop no I want to make sure that I that I just personally get to

1056
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,960
have this content in my life yeah I mean in my opinion in many ways it comes back to benefit me

1057
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,720
as somebody who has a patreon yeah because like it normalizes patreon to have more people on there

1058
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:40,840
there's more people like it like the more people are successful through it the more people will

1059
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:47,080
get one the more the cultural understanding will be that you can promote art this way yeah and so

1060
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,040
it's like you know in some way just like being a part of that system will come back around to help

1061
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:59,800
me as a creator too you know shout out to walters world travel youtube series he's like a dad I feel

1062
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:06,760
the same way I feel like you know if you're a patreon person you know it's nice it's nice it's nice

1063
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,840
to at least it's nice to be putting your money where your mouth is a little bit so I don't pledge

1064
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,080
that much but like I think I pledged like a dollar to the hippo I think I pledged a dollar to mage

1065
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,680
and maybe like actually japanese emoticons dot me might might be it that might be yeah that might be

1066
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:26,440
I also like until moving here I just had like more money than I knew what to do with so like

1067
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,000
the part of the reason I would patron people is it's just like well you need the money more than I do

1068
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,960
so I guess I haven't been in that position yeah like if I if I have like it's like a lot of the

1069
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:44,440
people I patron it's either because I am a huge fan or I'm a friend of theirs or I just like

1070
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,240
legitimately like their content more than my own yeah like if I watch somebody and they have a

1071
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:56,280
patreon and I think like this guy is an inspiration to me then it's like I feel as though I am getting

1072
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:02,120
something like like I'm getting something tangible from them like yeah you made this video that was

1073
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:07,320
amazing and it made me want to go make something amazing and I'm gonna give you money for like

1074
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:12,040
in trade for that that all makes sense I guess it's just a little bit of the objectivist in me

1075
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:19,720
that just says my job in life is to make me as good as I can possibly be including monetarily

1076
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,720
so I'm just gonna hoard all my money and build myself up so I can be the you know a fucking

1077
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:31,320
rock eventually you will have so much money that you eventually not know although I could also see

1078
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,200
you just putting all of that into a fund for your kids college or something so like certainly that

1079
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:41,080
would be on the on the to-do list for life at some point yeah I mean like if I was a millionaire

1080
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:47,240
this would be a different a different ball game but I am not I am not close in them give it another

1081
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:52,840
month or two give another give another patreon.com slash best yeah see how it goes I can't wait to

1082
01:10:52,840 --> 01:11:01,720
become a millionaire and the federal reserve sent you the gold play button yeah yeah oh my god

1083
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,520
I wish real life was as cool as you did you just send me a gold dollar bill did you guys I don't

1084
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,880
know who this was they said you're a gold tombstone random guy I saw on Twitter today but I just

1085
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,560
saw some dude just said like so this is a cool interaction I had with YouTube he's like hey guys

1086
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,320
like at Team YouTube whatever I've got 158,000 subscribers and yet you said you're like denying

1087
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,760
me getting my silver play button could you tell me why they said like hey we've reviewed this and

1088
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,760
apparently you've either violated our content guidelines or you've got too many strikes it's

1089
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,120
like okay here's the thing though I have no strikes and my I have not violated the content

1090
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,520
guidelines in any way would you care to tell me how though we cannot comment any further you are

1091
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,320
ineligible for the button but like I don't know where I fucking saw it was just on Twitter somewhere

1092
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:55,560
but uh fuck YouTube I guess is the point just just I still don't have a silver play button it's been

1093
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,440
fucking you gotta talk to him again dude YouTube just would be so better off if they just all you

1094
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,520
could do nothing differently in this situation but just explain the reason because if you don't

1095
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:10,680
explain it it looks like you're hiding something how many new people how many new people yeah past

1096
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,320
the hundred thousand like every week like it can't be that many it can't be that many no I mean I don't

1097
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:20,520
know what maybe a hundred I would I don't know be surprised if it was even that many yeah I mean

1098
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,520
sure there's some data on that something there's probably data by the way I'm coming soon you better

1099
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,680
have that fucking silver play button ready for me because I'm coming for it YouTube I'm gonna

1100
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:35,160
want it day one so get to work I mean coming for that gold I'm coming for that diamond I never

1101
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,960
get it Nate they they sell uh face diamond 10 million I've seen that I've seen the fake ones

1102
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:47,320
right that's what I'm gonna get I want that fucking button when I cross a hundred or now

1103
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,880
they get you give a plaque instead of a button now why maybe when I hit 20,000 I'll like carve one

1104
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:58,200
for myself out of like balsa wood yeah good idea did you and Nate yeah real question why are you

1105
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:05,000
both doubling down on two companies which you both hate because YouTube is still the biggest game in

1106
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,800
town and for the cut for what I'm doing it's by far the best option will you switch if there is a

1107
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,240
genuine actual real alternative capillary alternative you know what I'm probably just upload

1108
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,360
to both and then just like play the fucking field because why not just I'll optimize on every plan

1109
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:25,320
I mean I'm thinking of doing like a bit shoot and shit it's just that I don't really think my content

1110
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,840
is in the realm of like danger for being like destroy like with Viagra the goal of Viagra I

1111
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,680
will tailor my fucking shit to work on YouTube whatever that requires I will do it it is a business

1112
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,120
to succeed on YouTube requires frequent uploads oh there it go I would say that you

1113
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:53,640
damn boy yeah thanks um you survive somewhat because no one hates you

1114
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,680
you're very good at not having enemies I feel like that's a lot of the reason why no one comes

1115
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,360
out because I think it's because I'm a middle child and I'm the mediator of the fan you gotta you

1116
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:07,080
gotta you know you it's just like it's just like it's just like Dale Carnegie says and ways to

1117
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,960
fucking uh how to make friends how to make friends and and influence people yeah if you don't have any

1118
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,840
enemies find a way to make some because the most steadfast allies are enemies you've turned into

1119
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:23,560
friends it's just like how Skeeter says and Doug funny people are going wild for this pizza as Dale

1120
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:29,400
Carnegie also says in how to win friends influence people tippy that yellow haired pup that my daddy

1121
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,920
bought for me for 50 cents was the light and joy of my childhood until one tragic day he was killed

1122
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,240
by lightning not 10 feet from my head anyway on to what else I was saying no further elaboration

1123
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:47,240
you know uh it's a great book I uh it's true I don't seem to have many or any enemies even though

1124
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:52,680
I've said some shit that people don't care for in the past these because I'm so damn conciliatory uh

1125
01:14:52,680 --> 01:15:00,840
and maybe it makes me I don't think I'm a pushover uh but I do think a lot about how to not fuck up my

1126
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,960
life and that's a big one that's a big one not just making people hate me I mean whatever even on the

1127
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:11,800
basically anytime you're in it I hate you name what are you talking about correct where you're

1128
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,960
saying Tom every time we're even on the pcb and we have an argument like that like I've noticed

1129
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,640
your strategy is basically to always like find a point of agreement or something or at least yeah

1130
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,320
or at least say the words that kind of sound like you're agreeing well it's gonna help them they're

1131
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,800
retarded because I hate so much like I could argue with a socialist all day I could say like no

1132
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,680
capitalism's good and like a harder comic could be like no communism's good and like I'm sure they've

1133
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,520
got good things about kindness like I'm sure I would say good things about capitalism like we're

1134
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,960
wasting our time doing that shit what we need to be is go way the fuck back and be like okay so do

1135
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,680
you think it's actually okay to like take the the the sweat off of someone's brow we like worked it

1136
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,400
as capitalism would like say and they'd be like yeah for this reason I'm like okay here's why I

1137
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:59,880
disagree and like but that's a meaningful debate not just like 400 million dead in Russia versus

1138
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,920
you know like the poor the working poor are oppressed in the whole west or you know the way

1139
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,720
I feel exactly the same time I want to have productive debates slash arguments not just

1140
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,520
waste my time this is the way it is for everyone on the pcb yeah where we all say something fucking

1141
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,960
retarded and they're ever and else is like that's obviously stupid and then they dial up and then

1142
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,640
we all dial it back to what our actual point is was easy which is extremely reasonable

1143
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:35,960
like all agree on yeah yeah yeah I mean like personally like I I will go out of my way to

1144
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,960
frame things as stupidly as possible it makes me so mad it's so the conversation can last longer

1145
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,880
I mean like I'm trying to fill time on a show where we have to have like yeah we gotta talk about

1146
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,240
something a big part of it is something that isn't even real honestly I've trained myself to speak

1147
01:16:53,240 --> 01:17:00,120
this way and like granted I've always been long-winded but like I have to put out hours and hours and

1148
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:07,400
hours of content every week I can't really come up with new shit to say all the time and most

1149
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:13,400
arguments have been had before so it's like how can we have this argument in a way that will be

1150
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:20,200
really dumb and waste everyone's time so that we can fill in our content that is so true

1151
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,840
we were kind of talking with with econ about this yesterday uh about like I mean at least I was like

1152
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:33,400
the purpose of media and like is it not just kind of wasting everyone's fucking time to not just be

1153
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:38,600
like like read a textbook on whatever it is you're arguing about don't fucking watch like uh the

1154
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:44,200
Lion King to learn about why revenge is not whatever the fucking point of Lion King is uh but then

1155
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:49,880
econ made a very reasonable point of uh what media does is it it's basically the Huey's law

1156
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:55,880
should I say which is totally redundant whoever it's like it it packages a moral and you fucking

1157
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,920
take it down you're like I learned why the lions are like good because it's bad to just kill people

1158
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,320
and kill your you know your brother so that you can be king you shouldn't do that I don't know why

1159
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:12,040
if it's a bad example a bad choice okay undertale undertale

1160
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:21,320
is good the moral that's what I learned so I was a little bit cynical about like if if media even

1161
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:27,560
has value because I feel as I think I said this before but as I go forth on my crusade to talk

1162
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:33,320
about anime and video and shit I'm letting you know right now I'm gonna be talking about same

1163
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:38,840
points forever it's just gonna it could recontextualize in the different show that happens to be the one

1164
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,400
but the the fundamentals are the same and I've elaborated them many times in the pcp that's

1165
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:49,160
what it's gonna be if you read any author or listen to any speaker yeah like that is what they do

1166
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,480
yeah they just repeat themselves I mean does you have to do you try to speak the truth and I

1167
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:57,480
guess you could say that it's about you want to find the one way they're able to deliver it aka

1168
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,400
like the entertainment value that's applied to like perhaps that way you deliver that message

1169
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,680
that actually gets people to swallow it I mean oh I get it now there's there's been a ton of my videos

1170
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:12,600
that like people will watch it and go like oh you already said this in an after dark video yeah

1171
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,360
but like in the after dark video it's like I just had this idea it's just exploding out of me for

1172
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:23,960
like 25 minutes it's not really well phrased it's not like thought through and then like sometime

1173
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:28,600
later I think about it again and I'm like oh now I know exactly how to put it in a way that more

1174
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,360
people will understand and I can make like a full video out of it and so it's it's usually just about

1175
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:40,520
like how can I keep repackaging this statement in ways that will give it different nuance make

1176
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:46,600
different people understand it and make the content feel different you know yeah yeah that's the point

1177
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:52,600
I guess like you know it was interesting I saw this guy um Aziz Ansari he's like uh he's like a

1178
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,760
American Muslim activist and he's had like some arguments with like Sam Harris but wait he said

1179
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,920
a very interesting thing one time he described him as an activist but he's like comedian an actor

1180
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,680
oh sorry it's very famous it's not Aziz Ansari it's um it's Reza Aslan that's right yes I'm pretty

1181
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,680
sure it's Reza Aslan that's who it is not not the comedian uh him and Sam Harris like had some

1182
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,200
arguments and like a while back he just came out he's like I've been debating people on like

1183
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,880
philosophy maybe his thing is like you know Islam is good you know we just need to like

1184
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,240
whatever doesn't matter um he's he's making this point he's been like I've been debating people

1185
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:30,280
like Sam Harris and other people forever nobody fucking cares it's not changing hearts and minds

1186
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:37,960
got a better idea I'm going to make tv shows that like show positive Muslim characters and like this

1187
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:42,040
is just what I'm doing now it's it's the point is the same it's like convince people that like you

1188
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:46,280
know Muslims are good or whatever and uh this this is just gonna be a way better way of changing

1189
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:51,640
hearts and minds and uh yeah that's media for you I guess I mean you gotta trick people into thinking

1190
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,920
they came up with the idea themselves that yes yeah that sounds like Huey's long action indeed

1191
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:01,320
they watch a show it's like got like I don't know like a Muslim kid maybe he was like bullied by like

1192
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,640
the the mean Christian kid in that episode and then at the end the Christian kids like man you

1193
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,200
know maybe we're not so different boom you just indoctrinated a thousand ISIS members right there

1194
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:15,320
lining up in the fucking trenches uh yeah so I guess that's how I got there I guess that's literally

1195
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,640
what I've been saying I'm doing only it's my philosophy not his philosophy which means it's

1196
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:25,720
better which means it's better yeah I guess a lot of people do that and uh yeah I guess that's it

1197
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,280
sip and tea like kermit over there but that's none of my business

1198
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,320
but but but recruiting members of ISIS that's none of my business

1199
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,880
anyway he says calling up his business agency we've got two more boys

1200
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,120
yeah

1201
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,680
on the bottom of the cup is like join

1202
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:57,080

1203
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:05,080

1204
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:10,680

bad why at the world we feel bad about your question um okay here we go this one all right

1225
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:27,560
this is whatever kind of cool at rad a cool gamer asks what piece of media do you feel the worst

1226
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:36,360
about liking the pcp avril Lavigne yeah what's that avril Lavigne's entire discography uh uh huh

1227
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:44,680
a life's like this uh huh yeah that's the way that's the way it is and it is though but it is though

1228
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:52,680
damn many of a type avril Lavigne is a choice life but she's into my japanese shit with her

1229
01:24:52,680 --> 01:25:00,280
hello kitty song she loves kakakawaii kakakawaii i never even heard that one before i think my answer

1230
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:05,880
is he's singing parts i've heard a clip i saw a clip of it i think i feel the worst about liking

1231
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,760
rap music from artists who are not okay with white people saying the n word i know what you mean

1232
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:16,600
i know what you mean yeah yeah like when they adamantly in the songs are like yo white guys

1233
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,800
don't be singing along to this shit and i'm just like come on guys like or like just a lot of there

1234
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,280
are like a lot of rappers who have like an active disdain for their white audience hey i've got i've

1235
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:30,280
got a question about that i've been i've been considering considering that issue do you think

1236
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,920
because like okay if you are uh uh one of these people one of those people selling to the world

1237
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:40,600
do you think it's is that a reasonable complaint to make considering that you're selling to a lot

1238
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,560
of those white folks maybe if you said i don't want white people to talk about you've talked about this

1239
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,880
before have we yeah yeah you know what i guess at the end of the day like the point of their music

1240
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:57,720
is to be emotional to express how they feel so like if they feel uncomfortable with white people

1241
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:04,040
saying the n word then like you know it's fine that they want to rap about that it's just like

1242
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,640
when you're listening to something and it seems like it is attacking you personally and you can't

1243
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:14,520
really argue back or you get the sense that this person would not be willing to listen to arguments

1244
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,880
back then it's just kind of like you just can't help but get pissed off hearing it i know what you

1245
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,800
mean i know what you mean uh monchi what are you most ashamed of like i i don't really have any media

1246
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:31,320
that i'm ashamed of i mean i i like every i don't believe in like guilty pleasures really i like

1247
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:36,440
everything that i like if i didn't like it then why would i like it i don't know well it didn't

1248
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,280
necessarily ask if you were ashamed to say what do you feel the worst about like feel the worst yes

1249
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,800
so like there's other ways like i i'm not ashamed of liking that music i just feel bad

1250
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:54,760
because i like it yeah i know that the person does not like me um i guess i feel bad about

1251
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:03,000
liking generic youtube shit just because it just because it like eats up your time and ruins your

1252
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,240
life yeah and also i just feel like i'm not supposed to like it like i don't know sometimes i'll

1253
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:14,280
upload youtube and i'll feel like what like what's the world like what what's it like out there past

1254
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:19,960
past the forest and i'll go on the trending tab and i'll watch maybe one or two videos and i'll

1255
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:26,280
think ha ha yeah okay and then close it and i'll think i should have hated that like like it shouldn't

1256
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,880
have been even lukewarm or anything it should have been like i like i actively dislike this

1257
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:37,160
and anything that's trending yeah if i see it and like i shouldn't like this this is horrible this

1258
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:44,840
wouldn't be trending if it were worthwhile yeah hey monkey away asks why are you guys so averse to

1259
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,760
talking about big topics you have passionate opinions on it's a lot more entertaining than

1260
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:55,640
Nate's gay ass vacation stories i guess we did briefly touch on well we tried it we tried it today

1261
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:02,120
and it was bad i didn't actually want to talk about capitalism because like yeah i don't like

1262
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:08,120
i don't really admit i am no expert on economics yeah i don't i don't really feel qualified to talk

1263
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,440
about it either passionately about have we not talked about well there's always the jq which we

1264
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,920
might want to get an answer here you know i didn't know what that was i found out like a week ago

1265
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:24,680
what the hell is jq it's a jewish question what is that oh he doesn't fucking know i don't i don't

1266
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:33,160
i'll check tom's q and a for sure yeah i found myself restraining speaking about things that

1267
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:39,320
interest me basically every single pcp episode i'll have notes and i'll be like wait a second i

1268
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,640
forgot none of these people have the same interest in me time to delete half of it why would you

1269
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,880
think so like why do you think that like what's the kind of stuff you bring up because like if

1270
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:53,000
it's something like oh like i watched this anime that none of you guys have seen and i wanted to

1271
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,040
talk about it like obviously i wouldn't talk about that i don't think there's any it's like that but

1272
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:02,920
for instead of like shows is interest like like what's an interest you have that you don't think

1273
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:08,280
any of us would be interested in talking history history's interesting to everybody it isn't

1274
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,320
history i feel like an asshole every single time i i talk about like what what is something

1275
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,880
historical that would not be interesting to people i don't know i think a lot of people

1276
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,600
will consider it a rather boring school type subject in my mind related to some if you have

1277
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:28,600
like there's a point to be made by history is not boring school is boring i mean i agree from my

1278
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:34,600
perspective if anyone says anything i didn't know it is automatically interesting like yeah no matter

1279
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:39,320
what in taking information i didn't think the thing is more like munchie doesn't know whether

1280
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:46,440
we would make a good conversation piece he doesn't just want to say things that no no i don't i also

1281
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:51,960
don't want you to just bring up history anecdotes with no like particular point behind them exactly

1282
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:57,000
yeah so that's why i don't do it this is i'd be a weird asshole for doing that i mean i mean why

1283
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,040
would you want to do that well no i'm saying i want to talk about history and other things not just

1284
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:08,920
that but like why would i do it on the pcp when this is clearly not a good avenue if it's entertaining

1285
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:12,120
and i guess everyone you know i don't bring up stuff i don't think it's entertaining for the

1286
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:16,600
exact same reason and like well that sounds boring and gay so i think it's entertaining to me but in

1287
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:21,400
this context with these people and for this audience no why i mean if you had like let's just

1288
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:26,760
say you read a fucking book and like which i have i can't i don't believe you but like if you did

1289
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:32,280
okay uh and there was like some like you fucking the the you know whatever the fucking fall of

1290
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:36,520
pompeh and like you were like guys just listen to this fucking story about this thing that happened

1291
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,880
in real life and then you told it in like a sick way or something like that i don't know maybe that'd

1292
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:47,000
be cool i know i know i know a fact that we all be interjecting and joking and being like hey hey

1293
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:53,720
hey munchy i know i know a fact about pompeh tell me if you heard this one in pompeh it was common

1294
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:59,160
for people to just write on walls yes a lot of graffiti a lot of our enemies would say pom gay

1295
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:05,320
and i was i remember i read i read a thing about like stuff like like archer archer not architects

1296
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:09,240
archeologists they found like that all these messages carved into walls and stuff around the

1297
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:17,320
city including the ironic joke everyone writes on walls but me that's good there's a fuck ton of

1298
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:25,080
sex and pompeh that guy went on to bake homestuck yeah he then he then carved 18,000

1299
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:31,000
hundred words of a story about it's about well it's a story about these four kids they don't

1300
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,400
communicate in person they they but they they are friends through their wall star and they

1301
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:41,080
erupt and they all die yeah but but they get transported to a new island yes uh where they

1302
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,880
have to play a game to bring the old one back i like to imagine an old romanism just carving away

1303
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:50,280
today's your 13th birthday though it was 13 years ago you were given life as only today you've

1304
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,520
been given a name and people just looking on and whore like what the fuck is this guy do imagine

1305
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:59,640
if someone just yeah they just carved like like a story prompt and they went yeah yeah and then they

1306
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:04,360
do like a lot like rp like over like a whole thing and they had like tell like good fun like dnd

1307
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:09,880
campaign or something over like a fucking over the side of like an industrial complex we could just buy

1308
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:19,640
a wall and buy a wall right right we can build a wall yes that wall yes that wall see that's

1309
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:25,320
what we're not all right yeah when that was the high point of this whole episode it was good time

1310
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:33,800
to go out on a high then we have to build the wall we've decided right um we got a lot of people

1311
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:38,120
asking for lectures let people talk about they want more lectures we don't have time we don't have

1312
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,640
time i know if you guys want more lectures give us a shitload of money so that we can fly to each

1313
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:49,240
other's place and lecture each other about bullshit so intangible you know i hate making it like i've

1314
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,640
always said like hey guys if i make more money i'll finally be able to go to youtube i've always felt

1315
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,440
bad about promise that because it's so vague and not concrete i mean it's the way to think about

1316
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:04,200
i mean it is literally true in this case i don't think it's deniable that if we had the money to

1317
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:10,040
group up we would do lectures i mean i would have needed extremely successful yeah yeah like

1318
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:15,400
none of us knew that this was gonna happen far enough ahead of time to prepare i mean i was occupied

1319
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,440
with i have i have i have like two and a half lectures maybe ready to go in the chamber but

1320
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,360
it really none of them well none of them are like ready to go they all need they'll need research

1321
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:29,400
i only have one and i have to do like extensive research to make it possible i i have can tell

1322
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,360
after the show i'll tell you right now it's okay it's about the co-heating cambria album narrative

1323
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:38,680
that sounds great that i would love to hear that i've got buddies who told me about it

1324
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:47,720
tectonic improv's uh uh a top a top the fourth wall linkar is a top the fourth wall is a good

1325
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,840
one to tide you over it's good it's it's it's very much like one of ours also there's a bunch of

1326
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:58,840
really funny parts where it seems like the friends the friends that he's conscripted to listen to his

1327
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:04,520
lecture seem really they're mostly okay but every now there's like one like heckler in the crowd

1328
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:09,800
he seems like mad to be there and there's a couple of times where like they have some banter back

1329
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,040
and forth and it's not quite sure like is this serious like are they actually mad at each other

1330
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:19,400
are they gonna have words after this oh yeah yeah it's great that narrative compelling i did yeah

1331
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:27,240
good i'll let you watch that um oh you can also watch down the rabbit hole different style but

1332
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:33,640
same kind of content you know i'm thinking i'm thinking monchi wait wait wait about the down the

1333
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,600
rabbit hole i mean i have i've mentioned the um the the poos adventures of in the lion king heart

1334
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:42,760
fantasy films that's like a short one i've been thinking about maybe making that into like a down

1335
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,440
the rabbit hole style video instead of a lecture because i don't know if there's enough there to

1336
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,400
make into a full lecture but even if i do that i still have at least one lecture that i definitely

1337
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:57,560
want to do but down the rabbit hole thing sounds sick yeah yeah yeah that one's been it's it's time

1338
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,880
it's time to deliver on that one because the world still doesn't know yeah world still doesn't know

about lion king heart fantasy films there's some intense shit going on now tom are you reading

01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:32,680
hastily asked guys we need questions right now stumbling out of the gate comes out oh my phone

1352
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:41,160
what's popping shit all right this is the best you could do under such uh high pressure

1353
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:48,040
um all right these are shit uh me cool man asks when will you create your next masterpiece

1354
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:54,120
which i find an interesting question i fucking made a masterpiece yeah if you don't say it

1355
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:57,560
yeah

1356
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:07,080
excellent how do you like go on i feel that my my latest album the world over yeah it's the greatest

1357
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:13,000
masterpiece i've ever created so i am not due to create a masterpiece for the next day i have to

1358
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,280
go listen to it day i didn't listen to that one uh uh i'm where did what beats did you use for it

1359
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:24,520
it's entire no it was entirely me rapping over the dot hack sign soundtrack all right and uh i'm

1360
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,520
gonna i'll probably make a video explaining the narrative behind it because it's a concept album

1361
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:34,440
let's do and then i think there's some people who will enjoy it even more wait what's it called

1362
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:41,240
the world over didn't you see my video that was like apocalyptic cyberpunk trapped in the internet

1363
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,880
anime soundtrack mixtape the world i saw that i didn't click on it

1364
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:53,960
the work on those titles and thumbnails dude it's the i mean i thought that was a perfect title

1365
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,120
that's like a title that would make me click on it look the zoomer demographic doesn't agree

1366
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:04,840
clearly i guess so but uh it's it's uh it's by far the most work i've ever put into anything

1367
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:09,880
probably hey so we have the billeted cuppings but this is a provocative question that i like

1368
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:14,920
and it's uh in light of recent events asked mr bones what are your overall thoughts on

1369
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:21,640
monkey as a content creator considering that he was was decided to be too hot for youtube he

1370
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:31,000
could not exist on here yeah i think that i mean i guess i can understand youtube's reasons why i

1371
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,520
don't agree with them yeah i don't think he should have had his channel terminated but i guess i if

1372
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,640
you if you put a gun to my head i could tell you why they probably did it for pr reasons i

1373
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:46,920
suppose that i don't think it's fair it's like his stuff is like asking about whether you thought

1374
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,520
it should get deleted from youtube or just your opinion he's just saying like i mean considering

1375
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,520
recent events of him being deleted from youtube like what do you think of him as a content creator

1376
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,680
i think he's a hard-ass worker which i respect he is definitely a hard worker but he has always

1377
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,640
pushed the line of edginess and like like monkey would say it's jokes which i agree with and i would

1378
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:10,120
100% allow it if i was platform but considering youtube's corporate squeezing of things i i do get

1379
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:17,000
that they think that like like the kind of a little bit of line blurring humor that monkey uses

1380
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,680
that it obviously it's not he doesn't fucking endorse elia roger but like when you make lots of

1381
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:29,800
edgy jokes uh i just i get why like you know the normos are not going to be like oh i get it this

1382
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:34,280
is a joke and i don't like elia roger they'll be like like he actually he was literally cited

1383
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:39,160
in in someone's i forget this was like on some news channel or something about how um somebody

1384
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:43,160
please put this in the description somebody's gonna know this or in the comments it was like

1385
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:48,520
somebody made a video about like incels like the rise of the incel threats and like used a clip of

1386
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:55,000
monkey's video about elia roger as like look as like this this is what we're dealing with yeah

1387
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,760
where is a literal parody comedy video but the thing is though if you just watch it and you

1388
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:06,600
don't know it's a parody like are you how if you saw like a clip you might think well okay here

1389
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,360
we go i mean it's obvious to me but i'm also like steeped in context yeah yeah as a real i'm just

1390
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:18,600
saying the joke got old i've had enough mumpy jones it's time for money james to make money james

1391
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:25,800
money james money james money james money james by the way uh just a small update on this uh you

1392
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,720
know how uh sheep over made a channel called jungle jimmy or whatever deleted it was it's not owned

1393
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:36,600
by monkey it was owned by sheep over deleted it's really yeah i mean that's what sheep over just

1394
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:43,320
tweeted uh whatever was called jungle jimmy boy oh they are going hard to yeah they didn't do that to

1395
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:48,680
fucking uh keemstar when he said uh drama alert is run by another person i'm just the hired actor

1396
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:55,560
to be honest but i guess monkey was this is too much this is too much shit i don't i'm surprised i'm

1397
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,720
really surprised they don't want them they do not want them uh i guess their minds made i mean

1398
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:06,040
they didn't do that to mike the smoker mike the smoker got his channel back i guess they consider

1399
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,760
him less doing tobacco reviews i just don't understand how they have a how this laser focus

1400
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:15,960
i'm joking i just i just think it's funny that mike the smoker is a real thing it's like the the whole

1401
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:21,960
like the the the eye of sauron that is youtube fully did turn its attention like we can all

1402
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:26,360
like we say you know some some shit here that mike had us flagged but like we're under the radar

1403
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:33,000
it feels like the full light of god is shining on monkey in judgment and saying you will not be

1404
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,600
here you will be removed for because we want to do that somebody somebody made up their minds

1405
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:43,080
somebody decided yeah yeah it's so weird i mean what do we think about i haven't seen

1406
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,360
constantly a while but i used to think he was i don't know i have no reason

1437
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:06,280
not because i've barely done anything uh so if i reach the end i had very little to say from the

1438
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:11,800
start uh no i mean like i said before i feel like everything i do for the rest of my life is kind

1439
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:17,080
of going to be repackaging the same ideas i'm generally talking about on everything but i i would

1440
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:24,360
i guarantee you i'll find cool ways to do those in entertaining ways uh as we go forward i literally

1441
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:31,560
have amazing ideas for content like several times a day way more than i could ever feasibly create

1442
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:36,600
way most of it i end up coming down on the side of like i don't know if i'll ever find time for

1443
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:44,360
this like yeah like over christmas break because i i went to um i went to uh may's parents house and

1444
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:49,480
like just didn't work for like five days and like the whole time we were watching christmas movies

1445
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:57,160
and i had like this really huge idea of like an epic ranking and bass analysis video an idea for

1446
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:02,520
like a how the grinch stole christmas video like reviews of like several other movies it was just

1447
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:09,480
like a diehard like i thought of like a like a whole like a new way i could take on diehard and

1448
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:14,680
explore like why that movie's good and like just all this shit and like one of those around christmas

1449
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:22,040
i have no idea if like if any of these like all of them i know would be successful videos but do i

1450
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:27,560
have the capacity to write them and edit them and give enough of a shit all the way through production

1451
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:32,120
while still working on other things that's the question did you watch it's a wonderful life

1452
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:36,920
this christmas i did not it's a great it's a it's a tradition for me i love that it's great

1453
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:41,080
but i didn't watch a lot of i watched a lot of christmas movies i hadn't seen like i hadn't seen

1454
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:45,560
diehard so it was like i watched for the first time and i was like oh my god it actually is good

1455
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,120
it actually is good uh and uh i was really interested in exploring did he diehard because like

1456
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:56,440
other people don't get too far into my my theory yeah okay he was dead from the very start it was a

1457
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:02,600
dream sequence uh to answer this question on me a little bit more from the beginning of best guy

1458
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:09,560
ever i had like four videos planned one of which was the current log and stuff that's done another

1459
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:15,560
of which was the ghost the shell stuff not done and i've got there were two more beyond that that

1460
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:21,320
from the start i planned on making and i've made one of those and i'm working on the second of those

1461
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:26,760
four um i don't know what the fourth one is i only know two and three i'll give you a secret it's not

1462
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:34,280
the best anime ever but quite the opposite that that is true that is true um uh uh yeah i won't

1463
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:38,680
go into any more details i like to surprise people in general but i was gonna say but yeah well it

1464
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:43,000
doesn't matter uh uh when those are done and i will let people know when those are done just

1465
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,120
because for trivia sake at that point if you see my content drop off completely because i'm just

1466
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:52,520
like well i fucking said everything i got to say fuck i don't know what i'm gonna do uh fair enough

1467
01:47:52,520 --> 01:48:00,440
but until that happens no i'm not bankrupt yet so i've got things to say about stuff uh yes i feel

1468
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:08,280
like i haven't yet shown like my full power in anything you're like it freezes second form right

1469
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:13,560
now you haven't gotten five yeah like i i don't feel it took a while for him to i've i've had like

1470
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:20,360
ideas but i've never really fully embraced any one idea to like make it a proper like properly

1471
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:27,320
create it yeah right so like i yeah i want to see one day it's all up from here one of the things we

1472
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:31,160
should link this in the show notes uh a lot of people haven't seen it but like the animation you

1473
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:38,920
just did for the end of season one of rfck like oh uh s s descent s descent is one of my favorite

1474
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:43,640
things made in recent years by any of us it's on it's on uh the hit not the hypocrite channel it's

1475
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:49,240
on the give and take it's on no no it's on given fortress given fortress given fortress to pay this

1476
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:54,600
is well this is out yes it's been out since like july it came out in like june or july or maybe before

1477
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:59,400
that yeah that would be a concept was so good and i know it's like based on stuff it was based on

1478
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,040
like home stuff but it doesn't matter like i loved it so much that every sense there's a lot of

1479
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:08,600
original stuff i yeah absolutely i like man i would love to just see like i don't know give

1481
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:19,080
like that was the beat that i was seeing a glimpse into unleashing of your full power level and like

1482
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,080
i mean maybe it'll never happen maybe you'll just work on big stuff but like god would i love to see

1483
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:28,360
more of that i like the game that you made for escape snakes or yeah run away from snakes run away

1484
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:33,560

1486
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:44,280

attempt after like marathoning like all of german 985 and star underscores videos on tf2 like all of

1494
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:28,840
them um i just wanted to be one of them so i like started a tf2 gaming channel where i was going to

1495
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:35,000
be like a cool guy but now there's other stuff but like i i i don't think i'm well it just becomes

1496
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,920
like a shit rump channel after he abandoned it for so long and then it just became funny like

1499
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:56,440
the stream on there yeah oh yeah right yeah yeah i do remember that i think i had just thought that

1500
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:02,120
