1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Man, fuck school. Fuck school. I don't even know what these guys fucking said about fucking

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,100
school, but... Man, my fucking experience with school sucked ass. School's the reason

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,440
I wasn't able to be on this fucking podcast. That's why I'm doing this stupid, faggy record

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,760
by myself down in the fucking basement like a piece of shit thing. So this isn't even

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,900
gonna fucking... I'm not even able to know what the fuck anyone was saying. I'm recording

6
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,840
this fucking like a week after everybody else fucking did it. And it's all school's

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,420
fault. All right, so fucking... I mean, I'm not even like too pissed off about it anymore.

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,540
If this was like three or four years ago, I'd still be salty as fuck, but now I'm just

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,400
kind of like fucking disappointed. School just seems like such a waste of time, a waste

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,240
of effort, and most importantly, a waste of fucking money. And there was so little preparation,

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,000
so little understanding of what college in particular... I'm assuming we're talking about

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,600
school, we're talking about college, we're talking about high school as well. I think

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,760
high school's a necessary evil, but it's desperately in need of some sort of reform. Remember to

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,240
be a little bit more effective. I think education as a whole, like, even needs to decide we're

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,220
gonna go for like the fucking like, you know, classic Greek Academy style of school where

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,820
you're actually trying to elevate people to be the most intelligent they can be, or we're

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,420
going to say, fuck it, school isn't for intel intelligence, it's for preparing people for

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,180
the workforce, in which case we need to understand that school needs to be more specialized because

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,460
people's careers are specialized and we're wasting so much time doing all this fucking

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,740
bullshit, like, 80% of it we're never gonna use in our vocations. So we need to decide

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,700
just in general what we need to do with school, but that's neither here nor there. I'm gonna

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,480
rant about how much I fucking hate school. I don't know, I just, I guess maybe that does

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,560
kind of lead into my experience with school is that so much of my time spent in college

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,440
was doing classes that I had no interest in, and have zero application in my life today.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,840
And the same thing can be said with high school. I think, you know, elementary school, middle

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,360
school, and even to an extent high school, a lot of the subjects that you do in school

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,400
are very much necessary, you know, to create just sort of the basic core education of a

28
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,180
human being. But I think a lot of the stuff, I should probably turn the second sound off.

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,940
Wow, my phone and my fucking, all of you shut up, all of you fucking shut up. I'm trying

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,940
to be intelligent and you're ruining it. God, turn off none. No, no, don't bother me.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,860
What was I even saying? There's so much of school that is done almost like for the sake

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,980
of dick wagging than like actual application, you know, like I, I went to school for graphic

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,960
design. I guess I'm an artist by trade quote unquote, in terms of what my education should

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,680
be and we can get into that later. But I had to take like all this math shit that I'm never

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,840
used, you know, even like high school math, like nobody ever fucking uses it. It's really

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,200
interesting because I took you take all these math classes. And then I have the interesting

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,880
perspective of like reflecting on that. Because I have a younger sister who's you know, I'm

38
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,940
27. She is 14 right now. So there's 10 years sort of difference. You know, I can kind of

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,460
see her going through all this shit in high school that I did. And then my dad and like

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,260
me having to help her with math homework and all this shit, and just like asking about

41
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,860
all this math things that none of us use, nobody uses any of this shit. And that kind

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,060
of goes back to where I'm saying about specialization, like if you're going to go into math, like

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,120
if you want to be a mathematician, and like who really fucking knows what they want to

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,600
do in high school, right? But but let's say, let's say for shit and giggles, you did, you

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,600
know, that would be important. But there's there's practical math that were never taught

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,920
in school. And this is why I think like the whole kind of like romantic, you know, Greek

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Aristotelian Academy kind of school is just not even true anymore. Because if you wanted

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,440
to really empower people, if school was really a way to educate you, and make you a well

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,020
rounded person, why don't we have more practical skills? Like why don't we learn how to balance

50
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,060
a checkbook? Why don't we learn about, you know, taxation and tax laws and how we can

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,260
you want to take math, like let's let's learn how to balance your budget. Like that's

52
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,860
something that everybody in the fucking world needs to do is like, understand, let's have

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,020
classes on how debt works, how fucking, you know, applications of interest work, how bank

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,620
works, how you taking a loan and things like that, like practical math, if I need to sit

55
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,600
there and learn math, I want to learn math that I'm going to use in my life. And school

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
doesn't do that. You know, we have like this we've romanticized the STEM fields, but at

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,800
the same time, such a small percentage of the world actually uses STEM field knowledge

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,280
long term, but we hammer away that and make it so much more important, you know, and at

59
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,680
the same time, we kind of poo poo on the arts and stuff. And like that's always the first

60
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,420
thing to get budget cuts. But I think a lot more people, you know, or maybe not a lot

61
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,260
more, but just as many people would go into the arts, they wouldn't do STEM fields, but

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,660
the STEM field is so much more fucking grandiose, and it's sort of like position. But from a

63
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,260
culture perspective, we don't really we ignore STEM fields, and we, you know, fucking rock

64
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,260
stars and movie stars and shit. So the arts is respected culturally, but not intellectually.

65
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,980
And that's kind of weird. I would say it's definitely harder to be a scientist or a

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,600
mathematician or a physicist than it is to fucking play music or anything. But there

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
are two different kind of applications, and they take two different kind of mindsets.

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm fucking going all over the place. But school fucked me over. Because I think there's

69
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,160
a lot of pressure, at least there wasn't my house to go to school, to continue my education,

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,800
even when I wasn't sure if I even wanted to do that. I knew when I was a little kid that

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,840
I wanted to do storytelling in some fashion. And I always fancied myself an artist, even

72
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,180
though I wasn't really good. And that's kind of the weird thing is that nobody in my house

73
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,820
would just even to this day, no one has the fucking balls to say, Look, Tom, you're not

74
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,820
that fucking good. And so I know I'm not that good. But no one else will allow me to function

75
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,900
under that kind of mentality of that I'm not good. So I was forced in my house to pursue

76
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,060
art as a career, because that was something I'm interested in, even though I wasn't sure

77
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,280
at the time, it was something I wanted to do. I knew I liked it. I knew I enjoyed drawing.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,440
But I knew I wasn't good at it. But I wasn't good at anything else either. Like I was good

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
at playing Devil May Cry and drawing shitty comics. And that was it. So I really don't

80
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
have anything in terms of like applicable life skills. So I guess to some terrified

81
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,600
parents looking at their 18 year old son, who did nothing but play PlayStation and draw

82
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,860
terribly like the no eSports weren't a thing. So they couldn't funnel me into that nowhere

83
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,860
they probably want to. So I was the only thing they had to do. So I started applying to a

84
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,540
bunch of colleges for art and they all rejected me because I wasn't fucking good. And I knew

85
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,020
I wasn't fucking good. And so what I wanted to do is I wanted to take a year off of school

86
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,020
and just like work on my portfolio. Like if this is what I'm going to do, you know, I

87
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,140
guess I should work on my portfolio and maybe like figure out if this is even what I want

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,160
to do with my life because I don't fucking know like I'm a retarded kid. I all I did

89
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,440
to play PlayStation for like seven years straight. Like I don't fucking know what I want to do

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,400
with my future. But you know, the parents wouldn't let me do that. You know, they threatened

91
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,840
to like, you know, kick me out if I didn't go to school because they knew they're like

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,200
we're all fucking study show that if you don't go to school right at high school, you never

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,840
go. It's like, Well, maybe because those people realize it's not for them. But I never got

94
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
the chance to do that. So I ended up going to a really shitty school just because I kept

95
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,740
getting rejected from all these schools I was actually interested in. But the one school

96
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,060
I was really wanted to go to was the Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont, which is a

97
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,060
two year program for learning how to do comics, which is like the thing I was really interested

98
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,660
in. And it was right in Vermont, there's only like a couple of states over. So it wouldn't

99
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,220
be that far away from here. And like, I was like really gung ho about that. That was like

100
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,700
the one time during my senior year of high school that I was really interested in like

101
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
college was like, I will continue my education. This sounds cool. Like this sounds like

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,160
something I would be interested in. But the one time I showed interest, the parents had no

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,840
interest because they were just like, this is comics, you're never going to get a job with

104
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,200
this is stupid, we're not going to cosine loans on this. So don't bother applying. And I guess

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,520
loans lead you to the fucking money aspect of it. I'm $40,000 in debt. I got a terrible

106
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,280
education because I went to a shitty school that I didn't want to go to. And I went to

107
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,980
school for graphic design in 2007, which was probably the worst year to go into that fucking

108
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:59,460
field because in 2007, the iPhone launched and the iPhone changed the entire design landscape

109
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,300
because it went from shifted from print and web being two separate things to like everything

110
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,820
being web based everything being app based and because everything became app based and

111
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,980
the web exploded in terms of complexity, designers also have to be programmers now. If you want

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
to get a design job, you have to do all of the graphic stuff, all the layout stuff, but you

113
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,000
also have to be able to code websites and code and WordPress. And you had to do both

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,400
disciplines, but I was running on 2007 level education and curriculum. So by the time I

115
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,720
graduated, I could do print stuff, no problem. But like 2011, the iPhone four s was coming

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,960
out. The smartphone craze was in full swing and the industry was completely different. I was

117
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,180
completely unprepared for it. And to top that off, I was supposed to I did some internships

118
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,780
at my dad's place, he worked at Hanscom Air Force Base, and I was supposed to start doing

119
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,500
design work there. But two weeks before I graduated, they cut the program. And so I had no

120
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,620
job. So I wasn't looking for a job. So school just kind of fucked me over. So now I'm 40k

121
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,220
in debt. And all I can do is make YouTube videos that I don't even like doing, because

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,720
that's all I can do to make money. And I didn't get a good education because I couldn't get

123
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,640
into a good school because I wasn't good at the thing I was actually passionate about. I was

124
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,920
not allowed the time to get good at it, to get into a good school. And I probably wouldn't

125
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,560
even have gone to school anyways, because I've always wanted to be kind of an internet

126
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,480
entrepreneur, because that's the thing I kind of grew up doing was watching YouTube playing

127
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,840
video games, and drawing shitty little comics. So I just got kind of forced on the stupid

128
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,660
fucking path that I didn't want to do. And I've just kind of come to resent school as

129
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,460
a result. It just it fucking sucks. It sucked for me, you know, I just feel like I think

130
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,140
too many people go to school because you're supposed to, when so many people probably

131
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,660
don't. And I think even now with the fucking economy, the way it is, doesn't even matter

132
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,060
anymore. Does it's like school worth it? I think if you're going into a STEM field, school

133
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,640
is definitely worth it because the returns there are still big. You know, especially

134
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,040
if you're a woman trying to get into a STEM field, you got a fucking golden ticket right

135
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,000
there, you know, that feed that field starving for women, you're going to get into school,

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,960
no problem, you get, you know, bonuses and like fucking scholarships and whatever to

137
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,160
get into school. And like, it's going to more than pay off because those fields are hugely

138
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,080
fucking, you know, the salaries for those are massive. But like, if you're an artist,

139
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,260
if you're a creative, like, do you really need to go to school now? I think even now,

140
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,900
like you look on shit like LinkedIn and you look at like artist profiles, like people

141
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,820
judge you by your portfolio more than anything else. If you can fucking sit, stay, stay at

142
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,220
home or stay, you know, just go live on your own, work a shitty job and just grind out

143
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,780
a fucking beast portfolio, you can probably land a job somewhere at a smaller design firm

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,400
or a smaller company doing graphics work, or doing websites or whatever. And your experience

145
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,880
will build your portfolio and your resume at that point, and you never need to fucking

146
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,080
go into debt in the first place. This industry is evolving at such a fast pace, especially

147
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,920
now that it just seems ridiculous to go into that much debt for a field that like is mostly

148
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,880
freelance now, so you're never really going to get benefits. And even if you do that,

149
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,380
it doesn't pay that much shit doesn't really pay that high. So I don't know, man, like

150
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,460
I just feel like everything I did in relation to school is a mistake from just like not

151
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,660
paying attention in high school and not learning that shit to going into fucking college, even

152
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,420
though I knew I really didn't want to and I wasn't ready going into a field that I knew

153
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,940
I wasn't good enough for but everyone else wouldn't let me believe that for the sake

154
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,220
of my views, even though I was the only one being realistic. So and then I just feel like

155
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,080
school in general is caught in this weird middle ground of like wanting to be kind of

156
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,280
this Aristotelian greatness sort of thing, but also understanding that it's really just

157
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,160
designed to fucking have people like make good grades, fucking good do good on SAT scores,

158
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,200
so schools can get fucking more funding, and just prepare them for a fucking menial job

159
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,680
that 90% of their graduates are going to eventually fall into just because that's the way the

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,260
world works. So I don't know if this fucking fits with the podcast at all. Maybe it was

161
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:28,060
kind of depressing, but that's my thoughts on school. Nate, have fun figuring out where

162
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,680
this is supposed to fucking go. Hello and welcome to this week's episode of the pro

163
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,020
crest and natives podcast here. Once again is me and all my buddies. I'm the best guy

164
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,740
ever bestie boy.

165
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:49,800
We got the 21st century digital boy Digi bro over here. We got patron. Oh, he's still

166
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:58,200
going. Patreon.com slash Ben St. Patreon.com slash Ben St. That's that that meme ain't

167
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,720
going anywhere. And we have the Davoo collective. What's up, buddy? Every nuclear bomb has a

168
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,360
silver lining depending on the inflation rates. Yeah, Hiroshima has some really great

169
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,740
earthworms now. All right, so thanks for joining us again. Once again, folks, and we're here

170
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,140
to talk about a topic that, oh man, the passions are running so high in here. Some of us have

171
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,580
a healthy relationship with this. Most of us do not. I know, and it is. No, go on, go

172
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,740
on. Okay, I'm just going to say it is, in fact, a schooling with a particular emphasis,

173
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,960
I think on higher education, but we'll touch on the whole system. Let me let me just let

174
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,200
me just say, sure. We know a lot of our viewers are younger. We have some we have, you know,

175
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,840
some high school age viewers, I think, and to all those ones who might be wondering about

176
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,680
their future and wondering what direction in life they should take. Let me just say,

177
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,040
don't listen to your parents. Don't listen to your guidance, counselors and religious

178
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,080
authorities. Listen to this now. Yeah, this is the real deal. We've had real life experience.

179
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,020
All those religious authorities in your life, they all come from a previous generation before

180
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,420
this system got to be unbelieved. That is very true. We are all from your guys' generation.

181
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,020
We know what's up. I mean, I'm not me personally, but these guys do. I was being partially satirical.

182
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:24,260
Well, you can take it at your own risk. We are not professionals. You follow our advice

183
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:31,700
at your own risk, but here's my general advice, guys. I do not think that it is super beneficial

184
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,520
to go for a general education sort of thing. I would highly recommend you have a specific

185
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,680
plan in place with, like, action points there so you can guide yourself to what you're going

186
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,920
to do and go to, like, a community college. And hopefully by the time, you know, you guys

187
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,440
are rolling into a school, maybe a fucking... I don't recommend any of that. I don't recommend

188
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,520
any of that. I don't recommend you don't fucking go to school. Don't do it.

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,420
That's the best plan. That's the best plan. There is no chaos. Just don't go to fucking

190
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,620
school. All right. Well, it depends what you want to do. If you want to be a fucking, you

191
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,380
know, nurse or whatever, you got to go to school, but whatever. Like, okay, let's get

192
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,700
into our anecdotal stories here. Who wants to go first? Ben, let's hear about your relationship

193
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:20,340
with schooling. Well, fuck, it's complicated. I'll try to condense it as much as I can.

194
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,680
So I'm, I did the pretty normal thing, you know, graduated high school, immediately went

195
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,280
to college, was, you know, for four years, got my degree in four years, graduated, went

196
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:44,480
on to, you know, quote unquote, join the workforce, sort of, not really. And, and, uh, all right.

197
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,860
So like what I do now is obviously not the, like I majored in physics and philosophy and

198
00:16:50,860 --> 00:17:00,820
what I do now is obviously not the that, you know, do art and whatever. So basically it

199
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,260
had, it had no benefit whatsoever. Well, I mean, I did, I did, I did work in physics

200
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,420
jobs, like jobs that I needed a degree for a while, like for several years after school.

201
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,880
So it's not like I got nothing out of it. And I mean, more, more, more of the, here's

202
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,040
the thing, I can't, I can't extract who I am and what I do right now from my own personal

203
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:32,960
history, which includes having gone to college. So to me, like that decision was like an essential

204
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,280
part in becoming who I am. So I can't say no, it didn't work out. It kind of did because

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,840
I'm pretty happy with where I'm at right now. Yeah, but that you could say that for every

206
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,020
bad thing that happens to you. Yeah, I mean, that's true. How much do you have a lot of

207
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,580
debt or a medium amount of debt? Yeah, I do. I have like a like 10,000 or $20,000. See

208
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,820
that immediately. That's easy. That's, that's poultry. No, fuck that. Having any debt is

209
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,860
fucking disgusting. Having any debt is imperatively speaking here. Having any debt is disgusting.

210
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,300
I have like, I make so little money that I managed to get some of it. My payments like

211
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,520
deferred. So I lately, I haven't had to like pay that much back. I mean, I'm going to eventually

212
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,960
like, I mean, it's still accruing a little bit of interest. Like a couple, it accrued

213
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,960
like, yeah. So, so like it's still a problem, but it's not, I mean, I can safely ignore it

214
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,520
for right now. I don't know. I'm going to start paying it back as soon as I have a little

215
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,280
bit of extra money. Let's just, okay, yeah, that's cool. But let's hear DeVu's side of

216
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,500
it. His education experience, because this is a totally different story. Yeah. So my

217
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,620
dad was a dude who got several degrees and then realized he thought that school was giant

218
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,540
and giant gay. What kind of degree? Just had a curiosity. Like, okay. So like when he was

219
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,980
like 20 or so, he became a Christian and got into like Bible studies stuff, which were

220
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,940
like church leadership stuff that like, you know, is not necessarily as advanced as physics,

221
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,720
but stuff that does require legitimate education. Like he knows the Bible extremely well. He's

222
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,240
a big Bible otaku and he knows how to like do church leadership and stuff, even though

223
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,760
he's a Bible analyst on YouTube. Yeah, he actually wants to be. Dude, have me on his

224
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
co-host. I want to be in that. Well, yeah. Well, what he told me is that, hey, DeVu,

225
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,840
if you make videos, if you edit my Bible analysis videos, you won't have to pay rent

226
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,760
or pay less rent. Oh my God. That's the arrangement. Thankfully though, he hasn't, he hasn't actually

227
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,820
put me up to that yet. He's still working on it, you know. Interesting. Because he's

228
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,900
got a job, right? Can't get any internet work done when you have a job. Oh, let me tell

229
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,740
you what, that's like people. Okay, but go on. Yeah, we'll make that a whole separate

230
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,460
podcast. Yeah, having a job, the biggest problem in the universe for sure. Yeah, pretty much.

231
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,300
All right, go on, dude. How about you schoolin' now? So after all those degrees, I guess

232
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,620
he just, I don't know, I think my dad is just opposed to human institutions in general.

233
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,420
He started his own business. He just doesn't, so he did, he homeschooled all of his children,

234
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,260
including me, since I'm one of his children. Does that mean that your mom taught you and

235
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,960
stuff? Yeah, kinda. It's really weird like that, you know, because obviously part of

236
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,840
it was like religious motivation too. Yeah, yeah. That was a bit of it. But there's plenty

237
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,960
of Christian schools, like my own sister. Me and Ben went to church when we were younger,

238
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,680
with some homeschooled folks, and I never quite understood what was going on with that. Yeah,

239
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,440
hey, I didn't have a choice. I had to fucking go where my parents would literally murder

240
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,240
me, so, you know. Yeah, they would've fucking, they would've fucking Abraham and Isaac'd

241
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,720
their ass. They would've sent us to the hell that we so longed for by choosing not to go

242
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,020
to church, but, alright, go on, dude. Yeah, so, like, it was just, in general, my dad

243
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,300
just doesn't like the idea of school as an institution. He thinks it's kind of a waste,

244
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,740
right? Okay, hey, I wonder where you get that idea. My younger sister, who's 12 right now,

245
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,940
is so much like, she needs a social environment in order to learn. She just needs a school

246
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,380
system in order to even, like, be productive. So after like a year of, like, my dad just

247
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,220
trying to keep her out of this one Christian school, she's just like, she wasn't getting

248
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,280
anything done. She could not focus, so he finally brought her back. And my sister hates

249
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,760
all of her classmates. Whenever I talk to her, she goes on and on about how everyone at

250
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
her school is idiots, but she needs that environment in order to function. Interesting, okay. So

251
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,200
those are the kind of people for whom school is required, and I guess those are the kind

252
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,280
of people who invented school as a thing, right? Yeah, you know, there's different strokes

253
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,480
for different folks. It's the Aristotle model, you know. You all get together and you fuck

254
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,280
each other and you occasionally learn something cool. Right. That's what school is like. That's

255
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,060
what college is like. That's it. So I think that the two different like versions of homeschooling

256
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,500
that people are able to visualize is either no one ever gets anything done because it's

257
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,660
impossible to motivate yourself at home. Yeah. Or everything is extremely strict. I don't

258
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,460
know anyone who is like either of those extremes, because I know a bunch of homeschooled kids

259
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,580
because that's the environment my family brought me up around. You've got a little brother

260
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,180
though too, right? Yeah, my brother was also homeschooled as well. Yeah, okay. I think

261
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,120
we definitely leaned more on the never getting anything done side because me and my brother

262
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,800
are both, I mean, my brother particularly, I think actually has dyslexia. He can't read

263
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,680
super fast, even though he's very smart. And even though obviously I'm a genius of all

264
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,200
times, I can't, I can't focus. I can't learn anything in like a coherent way. And it's

265
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,480
written in a Thomas Sowell audiobook. Yeah, right. You know, stuff like I just, you know,

266
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,580
even that if you wanted to like do a test on me to like remember specific names, there's

267
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,700
no reliability with my ability to remember specific names is not intelligence. It's

268
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,020
dumb bullshit. They make you do it. Right. But now here's what I want to get into, right?

269
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,340
Because like, because as I've been getting into YouTube and really, really admiring the

270
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,100
like vast knowledge of people like James Rolfe or even movie Bob, but like particularly

271
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,060
Jesse and Digi over here, Jesse who has an unbelievably broad knowledge of things and

272
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,120
Digi who has a unbelievably deep knowledge of things. And I, you know, I came to realize

273
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,440
that neither of them learned those things in any sort of way that they'd be able to

274
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,560
take a test on. Like imagine if they wanted to do an anime like school, it'd be like,

275
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,880
all right guys, today we're going to study Nietzsche Joe. You need to all memorize the

276
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,600
names of the staff members who worked on Nietzsche Joe and remember the air dates, the

277
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,880
air dates of each episode. And so you'd spend all week just learning a couple of random

278
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,260
facts about this one show. And you know, and like, whereas like all these anime analysis

279
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,980
people on YouTube who have all this knowledge, they just got it from like going on Mal or

280
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,820
anime news network and this just looking at random shit for like an hour every night.

281
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,140
It's amazing what the human mind can do when it has passion for its subject.

282
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,180
I look back on like how I like history. I think history is fascinating. I just hate

283
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,540
learning history the way school wants me to do it. Right. So like, because like the way

284
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,600
the idea is the right way to learn history.

285
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,560
Yeah. Um, like, okay, because like, so my mom basically just gave me pre-packaged curriculum.

286
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Like she didn't do a whole, like, you know, she was fairly hands on, but it wasn't like

287
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,400
she was composing curriculum herself. So she just like gave like here, here's a CD that

288
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
teaches the sixth grade, put it in.

289
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,680
I'd like a hands on education from your mom.

290
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,360
So I basically, I basically got a standard curriculum in a way, right? So I know exactly

291
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,900
how all that goes and I know how tedious it is because it's like, I'll, I'll get a history

292
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,820
textbook and I just have to remember all these arbitrary names of things. And it's like,

293
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,820
you know, in the same amount of, think, think about this, think about it this way in the

294
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,060
same amount of time it would take to have a teacher explain to you what you're going

295
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,780
to learn and then go home and then read the chapter over and over again to make sure you

296
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,700
remember it and then do the homework and then like go do the tests and then like pace around

297
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,300
hoping you got the test right and then looking at the test in that all that time, you could

298
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,900
just read half the entire textbook.

299
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,880
You know, you can just get so much more done. Like if you are the kind of person who just

300
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,560
can just read stuff and like remember like 30% of it, that's a totally valuable piece

301
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,480
of knowledge. And like if I were to go back to myself as a kid, myself as a kid who always

302
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,160
wanted to be able to read, I mean, I'm a good reader. I always liked reading. I just always

303
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,400
was bored by all the books I had at my disposal. I just didn't find any books I liked. And

304
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,320
I was always like upset about it. If I could have talked to myself, I would have told myself,

305
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,840
just read the first chapter of every book in the universe, just read the first chapter

306
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,660
and stop as soon as you get bored because you could be like the knowledge guy and get

307
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,460
other people to read the books for you. Yeah, I mean, I like reading. I just think that

308
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,900
books are boring. And by the way, I attribute that to God. God denied me good books because

309
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,420
all good books have like spells or magic or violence in them. I wasn't allowed to read

310
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,060
Harry Potter.

311
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,660
Oh, yeah, that's true.

312
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,100
Well, yeah, but it's just one book. You get tired of it eventually. I told my parents

313
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,140
that last week. No, I'm not doing another Bible study. I've studied the Bible enough.

314
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,100
I'm done with it. Oh,

315
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
dude, nice.

316
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,320
I mean, yeah, it's true. Like it's just like how the heck are they still not bored of that

317
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,920
one book? But like Harry Potter, right? There were stories in the news about kids being able

318
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,440
to finally get into reading because of that book. And I heard those stories on the news.

319
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,000
My parents were there. They knew that me and my younger brother were both not really able

320
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,120
to get into books, but that 0.0000003 percent chance that reading them would get us into

321
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,720
witchcraft was just not worth taking the risk. Let us be stupid instead.

322
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,580
Listen, listen, dear viewers, messed up, but hey, that is just that is just the first

323
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:14,460
example of how school is fucked up our lives irrevocably or irrevocably. And there's

324
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,380
that. I figured it out.

325
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,260
My biggest concern with this podcast is that we are going to make ourselves look like fucking

326
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,020
idiots somehow and convince everyone to go to school.

327
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,240
Like if anyone is like actually smart, someone who could actually like take tests well and

328
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,200
then is able to like really get a hold of their life and get a good paying job and just

329
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,560
like work at it like crazy until they pay off all their debt, you know, clearly the higher

330
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
education system will probably work out all right.

331
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,840
The higher education system does work out well for some people. There's no my good buddy,

332
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,320
Michelle. My good buddy, Michelle is now she's like 25 like me. She's married. She has been

333
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,260
a nurse like since she was 21 or whatever like after she graduated and she's just been

334
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,300
on the ground. Her student loans paid. She now owns a house with her husband. She's married.

335
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,540
She's I'm sure she's working on having kids like she's got herself a good situation going.

336
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,940
It's like the thing you gotta learn is that you gotta learn hard. You gotta know when

337
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,820
to give up. Like that's another thing I would have told myself as a teenager is hey, by the

338
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,780
time I was like by the time I was in eighth grade, math was just beyond me. I could not

339
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,840
follow it anymore. I would stare at a problem for an hour and a half and not be able to

340
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,920
do any of it. I would just not be able to figure out at all. It was, I just couldn't do it and

341
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,640
you know, I have, I programmed, I made an RPG like all by myself. It's buggy, but it works

342
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,440
most of the time. I made an RPG because I can do some basic

343
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,360
allergy when I what multimedia fusion, a program where you do need to do the programming

344
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,140
yourself. So, but like, yeah, like I can do math. It's just that the way that math is

345
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,740
taught is terrible. And Maddox was talking about this. And I think in one of the, one

346
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,180
of his bonus episodes of his podcast with Dick rest in peace, biggest problem about

347
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,580
how that math is taught terribly because all they do is teach the formulas. It's like if

348
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,020
you taught history by just telling you like the formulas of how history.

349
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,840
Look, I got better stuff to say. Let's, let's take a little break from Davoo.

350
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,080
I'm going to segue this back into other stuff about homeschooling, right? Cause like Maddox

351
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
would also talk about how like he, he brought in homeschooling as a problem one time.

352
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,840
They made a bunch of really good points, like how the parents will now monopolize the way

353
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,120
that that kid is raised. You don't get to have a diversified portfolio of authority

354
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,760
figures as you think that is indeed true. And he talked about how, cause like I think

355
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,640
people are concerned about the homeschooling thing cause a lot of it is for religious reasons

356
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,980
and a lot of times I was like, Oh, well, are they going to like deny evolution and stuff?

357
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,140
Like, are you not going to learn about that? Well, in the case of, um, cause I think this

358
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,540
is worth talking about on this podcast, right? In the case of my family, what they did was

359
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,100
they had this DVD that explains why evolution is not real, right?

360
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,380
But like, right, right? It was like this, this movie is like this documentary cause it talks

361
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:08,900
about the flagella motor, which was this, this one device in a cell that's like, when

362
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,640
you look at it, it's like so fucking complicated. There's no way it could just be put together

363
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,880
randomly. And then of course later on, I look on a YouTube video of some lecture of this

364
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,240
guy being like, Hey, you know that flagella motor that people make a big deal about? Here's

365
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,160
this other motor that's exactly the same minus two parts.

366
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Yeah. So it evolved into it.

367
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,960
But the thing is, the thing is though, through that documentary, I learned everything about

368
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,080
what evolution was. And then it was just later I had to learn the reputation to it. And then

369
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,160
I was completely on page with everyone else.

370
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,380
So then it's like, there's a thing called critical thinking that can help.

371
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,700
Right. Critical thinking. The biggest solution in the universe, no joke. So in general, my

372
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,780
stance on school is that it should just be whatever the heck you want it to be. And that,

373
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,020
you know, like homeschooling might be the best way. But like, you can, you can get plenty

374
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,380
of social interaction with homeschooling because like you have all this time on your hands.

375
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,180
If other kids are not always in school, there's plenty of kids to hang out with. It's not

376
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,860
really. So are you in favor of homeschooling?

377
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,520
I got 100% of my social interaction from school. I honestly can't imagine like a life without

378
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,720
having gone to school. It just seems totally alien to me.

379
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,800
Right. Well, here's what that's like. It's sort of like couples who get married early

380
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,760
into their adulthood. And then some of their friends don't get married. And they're like,

381
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,760
how could you not be married? Because my whole life is based around my family now. It's like

382
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,040
with school. It's like, because you have to spend all your time there, of course, most

383
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,720
of your life happens there when you don't have to be there.

384
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,220
There are young ladies at that school I went to, numbs and dog, numbs and dog.

385
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Yes, you have made yourself perfectly clear, best guy ever.

386
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,220
Yeah. I had plenty of social interaction. I just, I'm just awkward because of awkward.

387
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,220
You know what they say about high school girls? I keep getting older and they stay the same.

388
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,900
Let me break into this topic and say that on the, like education in general, right? I

389
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:56,100
think, I mean, yes, some people can succeed. And like you said before, some people need

390
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,440
that like social school environment to learn. I know that in discussion of like, like a

391
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,240
lot of people ask me if I went to art school. The answer is no, by the way. And on the subject

392
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,440
of art school, he went to fart school. This comes up a lot. People want to know, like,

393
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,600
is art school worth it? And the answer is like, you don't need to go to art school to

394
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,960
learn art. You can learn art on your own, but you have to be self motivated to do it.

395
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,780
You have to. And like the other benefits of art school that you can't get on your own

396
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,660
are like social networking and like meeting people and other artists in the field and

397
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,820
also that like structured environment that will like, here's where I'm going to break

398
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,220
it. That's a good point. Give me the in here. Okay, but I have to continue that point in

399
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,780
a minute, but go ahead. Well, okay, you just continue yours because I'm going to fucking

400
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,460
tell you. Well, that bit about being self motivated is really important. I mean, I think it applies

401
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,920
to all schools, right? And like all education. Yeah, we can get self motivation working.

402
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,800
The rest of this will work. Like, okay, in our society, a degree is important, but a

403
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,520
degree is kind of arbitrary. And without the degree, all a college is is just like, they

404
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,680
give you books and they bring you into a group setting and someone talks to you and tells

405
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,920
you stuff, right? And like anything you can learn in the classroom, you can learn on the

406
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,760
internet or by yourself or somehow you just have to be self motivated, right? You can

407
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,980
Google it. Like, if you like, if you really want something like Digi, you've talked about

408
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,580
this with like making videos, right? Like, no, you didn't go to school to learn how to

409
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,820
make a video. You just looked at other videos, figured it out. And because you wanted it,

410
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,020
you made it happen. You like, by whatever means necessary. And like with learning, it's

411
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,140
the same if you want to learn something, you're going to make it happen. You got to be, you

412
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,180
got to be passionate. Like, that's the thing, Ben, I think that the problem here is that

413
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,440
the same self motivation that would drive you to learn this shit on your own is the exact

414
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,240
same one you need to even be successful at school. So in the end, if you're so self motivated

415
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,400
that you could actually do well in college, you can just teach yourself shit. Like, okay,

416
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,000
my good friend, my good friend, Don, son, who I bring up all the time in some of my podcasts,

417
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,660
because he's a super fucking intelligent guy. This is a dude who had to he actually had

418
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,020
to drop out of high school because the fact that he had cluster headaches, which is a condition

419
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,100
where every morning he's so dumb, he dropped out of high school law every morning, he would

420
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,620
wake up and have like a size migraine that made it so he just couldn't do anything for

421
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,300
like hours on end, right? Yeah, yeah, made him a Hickey Comery. He stayed in his room

422
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,300
throughout the last two years of high school. I met him just because he happened to come

423
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,720
to school like two times. And one of those times he had a lucky star book. And I started

424
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,000
talking to him. Okay, so he's the guy. Now I'm connecting the name with the story. Okay.

425
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,200
So Don son, when I met him, he was in my Japanese class. He already knew how to read and speak

426
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,120
Japanese because he looked it up online. And he taught partly is because he'd seen every

427
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,360
anime ever. So he had some good roots in there. But like immersion learning or whatever. Yeah.

428
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,020
He learned, you know, just by just by looking at shit, he would read Japanese, like he learned

429
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,980
the basic symbols, then would read manga to pick up on some of the kanji. Like, you know,

430
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,420
a lot of manga has furry Ghana, where it tells you what each kanji means above the kanji,

431
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,980
if it's like a shonen manga and stuff. So he learned through that. The dude knows how

432
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:35,020
to do anything involving like building computers. He's like a super he knows a lot of computer

433
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,440
hardware stuff. And he knows everything about like networking, like he specializes in networking,

434
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,320
like computer networking is in connecting to the internet and shit like that. Right, right. And

435
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,240
he's super passionate about that stuff. And so ever since I've known him, he's been my tech guy. I

436
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,040
refer to him as my tech guy, because I don't know any of that shit. And I'm not at all motivated

437
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,520
to learn it. So anytime I have a technology problem, I come to him, you know, he's helped me

438
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,020
build computers. He's helped me figure out all kinds of new layouts for, you know, making our

439
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,460
house capable of having internet because it's too fucking big. This dude knew everything, right.

440
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:19,100
Then he got his cluster headaches got cured not too long after he was like 18 or 19 through magic

441
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,260
mushrooms, incidentally. Really awesome. It was an experimental medication. Did you know that if

442
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,420
you lock arms around a retarded girl and scream nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare,

443
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,640
it'll it'll cure her retardation. Yeah, that's on that's on record. Oh my God.

444
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,880
That's like why the only one laughing at that. I don't I don't know what what.

445
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,280
All right. Anyways, never mind. This dude, he got his cluster headaches cured. So he went to

446
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,680
college to community college, right? Because right, right. He he actually like, because he got his

447
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:01,180
GED, right after dropping out of a high school, he had never like he didn't study any of this shit.

448
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,420
He just like walked out, took the tests and got like perfect scores on all of them because he

449
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,580
knows everything. He's just a fucking genius, right? So he perfect scores all his GEDs. He goes

450
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:18,140
to college. He takes two years in like, you know, networking and computer fucking learning shit.

451
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,460
He gets his associates. He already knew all the stuff like he literally went to school as a

452
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,600
formality because he needed the degree in order to be hired. But he already knew all the things

453
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,480
he was learning. He already he got like a million qualifications, like took all these, you know,

454
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,080
tests for qualifications and stuff. He just knew all this stuff. And yet he still can't get a job

455
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,360
because nowhere in the field of fucking computer technology will they hire you unless you have

456
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:53,740
five years of experience. How do you get those five years of experience? Nobody fucking knows.

457
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:01,820
You could do an unpaid internship. Oh, great. For five years. Unpaid internships are such a

458
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,460
crime. They are the biggest meme that needs to die. They're destroying America as far as I'm

459
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,180
concerned. But you know, I got a buddy get away with that. I've got a friend, Rich, who went to

460
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,020
school out west in Seattle at like a heart. This place called DigiPen, which is like a hardcore

461
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,240
gaming school that like if you work there, you will get a job at Nintendo or like or one of these

462
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,360
gaming schools or gaming companies or whatever. And it's just he went to school with this guy,

463
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,960
Quest. That's his actual name, just pretty dope. And I know, right. And like Quest went there with

464
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,280
him. Quest was an awesome programmer went there for two years. It's a four year degree just dropped

465
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,200
out immediately got hired and has been doing that ever since he's been living the good life.

466
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,060
It's his last name, apostrophe revenge, probably probably.

467
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,060
So my what I was getting to there is if you're the kind of person if you already have like if

468
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,020
you're if you're graduating high school with a 3.5 grade point average or higher or even a 3.0 or

469
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:05,260
higher, like you have the mindset that you could succeed in college. But if you applied that

470
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:10,940
mindset to something you want to learn, then you will probably learn that thing. I think the

471
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,360
people who need to go to college, there's two types. One is if you have if you're trying to get

472
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,800
into a field where you can't do it by yourself, like my brother Victor, he's trying to become a

473
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,640
filmmaker. And I mean, it's possible to learn how to make films on your own. And there are some

474
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,640
directors who have done it. But like just even being able to handle the kind of equipment you

475
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,920
need to make real movies, which all of the equipment is at minimum $40,000 a piece. Yeah,

476
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,500
collected all on your own unless you're fucking rich. So in order to even have exposure to the

477
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,900
tools, and because you need a crew to be able to make a film, it's almost impossible to learn

478
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,180
that specific skill set without going to college, which is why for someone like Victor, it's good.

479
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,420
And then I think the other people who need to go to college are the ones who all they have is

480
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,020
study skills. Like if you graduate high school, and your skills are that you know how to study,

481
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,560
then you can go to college. And it won't matter what curriculum you take, because you'll probably

482
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,920
succeed at it. And I think that most people who become doctors and stuff, those are the kind of

483
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,960
people they are. They're people. Yeah, you know, my dad and my mom both didn't know what they wanted

484
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,880
to do specifically when they went into school and figured it out. And I've had great careers. I

485
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,320
mean, I had no idea what I wanted to do when I went into into college. Like I got there. And at

486
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:36,300
some point, I kind of decided that physics and philosophy were the mostly physics. Basically,

487
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,740
I just I chose that while I was there. And then I just kind of went with it for the foreseeable

488
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:47,620
future. And I mean, a lot of people, I mean, did you say that like, if you didn't go if you're

489
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,740
good enough for college, you could apply that knowledge to something you want to do. But what

490
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:57,540
if you don't know what you want to do? Or you want people who don't know what they want to do,

491
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,600
and or people who aren't that self motivated, you know, it's like, okay, people say, well, at

492
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,400
very least, school is a great way to get you to be motivated, right? Well, getting a job, even a

493
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,080
dumb job would probably do that just as well. If not better, I don't think it's good to be, I don't

494
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,200
think it's a good thing. And then guess what, here's the job. Oh, I fail. I don't care. You know,

495
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,680
right, because there's a thing though, right, a job, let's say, let's just say all things are

496
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,200
equal, that it gives you the same amount of inspiration or the same amount of like, allowing

497
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,780
you to eat up time while you decide what to do with your life. You'll walk away from a job with

498
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,380
positive money instead of negative money. That's the most important thing. That's like such a huge

499
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,820
difference. If college were free, I would say, yeah, if you graduate high school and don't know

500
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:50,500
what to do, and aren't that self motivated, go to college, but like Bernie 2016. Yeah, like it cost

501
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,920
so much money. So like, I don't, I mean, I feel like my college take my takeaways from college

502
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,520
were overall pretty positive. And yet, can I really justify all that in light of the like $20,000

503
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,480
I have yet to pay back? That's the question. I don't know. I really don't know. Because like my dad,

504
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,880
like right when he started a business, like 10 years ago, he started making me come to work

505
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,200
every once in a while, like once a month or so, like, Hey, David, or Davoo, which everyone I don't

506
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,340
know if I'm going to be like Maddox, where all my family members call me by my username.

507
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,020
Did they do that to his family members call Maddox now?

508
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:29,460
Well, like when he talks about his family members, they call him in his imaginary imagination. But

509
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,900
anyway, he started the window cleaning business. So I started like learning how to clean windows

510
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,860
by the time I was 13. And I was able to do it pretty well by the time I was 15. And then when I was

511
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,460
like 17 and a half, he made me start doing it full time. And it took me like, you know, three and a

512
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,220
half years or four years to finally make enough money on YouTube to break out of that. But the

513
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,600
point is, like if for whatever reason, like the internet just died, like like the internet just

514
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,680
all fried, there was no way to make any money off of it anymore. I would be able to like even

515
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,760
to and then let's say my dad's business just went under because no one wants to work for it, even

516
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,440
though he does a great job. I would be able to get a job doing like any sort of blue collar

517
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,480
thing, or that involves like getting on ladders or cleaning windows or like doing gardening. I

518
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,120
would know how to do that. Even though I would hate my life and want to die every second of my

519
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,060
life, I would be able to do it and like do it in a way that would like be friendly and like I'm

520
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,220
able to work really well when I'm at work because I have that experience. And meanwhile, like even

521
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,220
though I hate cleaning windows so much, and it's the most unsatisfying thing in the universe, it

522
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:34,500
is 1000 times more unsatisfying than 1000 times more less unsatisfying than figuring out when two

523
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,540
trains that don't exist will cross one another with cargo at 3pm.

524
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,600
I think the biggest problem here, I think the reason that college is so over glamorized in our

525
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:51,280
society is that everyone thinks that you need college to get a good job, to get a high paying

526
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,880
job. That's the meme. The imagination of it is that you get this high paying job. But the fact

527
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,600
is that blue collar jobs don't pay badly necessarily and there's a lot of jobs you can get with no

528
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,740
college education that you can make a lot of money doing and also an electrician or a plumber

529
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:15,020
people. Yeah, you'll be great. You'll be in great shape. Yeah, and it's also fun and cool to do

530
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,940
those jobs. You're building fucking houses. You have a life skill that will always be useful for

531
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:27,620
the rest of fucking time. But like, you know, like, I think, okay, here's here's my perspective on

532
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,940
all this because I want to I've been like a dragon in the waiting for like this whole time. Like

533
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,120
the same way I just want to just bite the head off of this whole entire school meme. There's a

534
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,920
meme that needs to die. Yeah. Like, in my experience, all of my friends went to college and

535
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,640
none of them have done shit with it. All of them are working normal ass jobs. I have a couple of

536
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,120
friends who just graduated who have like ideas of what they want to do with their degree. But like

537
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,740
overall, Victor is the closest anyone is to doing anything with it. He graduated and he's doing

538
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:10,100
film work, but he can can barely get paid. He can barely find work can barely get paid doing that

539
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,620
work. The only way he will have like an easier end would be if he went all the way out to LA

540
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:22,100
where everyone's trying to be a filmmaker. So good luck, you know, fucking tiny fish in an

541
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:30,840
enormous pond. But it's like impossible for any of these people to get work. And yet, my dad, who

542
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,520
he went to, he dropped out of high school. The second he turned 18, he got his GED, and he joined

543
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,200
them the Navy. He was in the Navy for six years. He got I think like two years of college

544
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,920
education in the Navy. I don't know what he studied like he didn't I don't think he majored

545
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:55,220
anything. I don't even know if he graduated or got marine biology, but he was in the Navy for all

546
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,860
this time. And then, you know, him and my mom were just working kind of like odd like my mom and dad

547
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,740
have always just been managers at like wherever they work, because they're both extremely hard

548
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,820
working and goal oriented people who love to be on top. Like my mom loves to be in control. Your

549
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:20,920
mom loves to be on top. Too easy. Too easy. She, you know, they both were always managers in like

550
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,120
in managerial positions. And then my dad started working for a car dealership, which anyone can

551
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,600
do. Like as long as you have the personality for it, it's really just a matter of being able to sell

552
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,480
shit to people. He became a car salesman, which is an impressive skill, by the way. It's a good

553
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:43,460
thing to have. Right. And he he had no idea how to do that. Like my dad, this is how, because most of

554
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:50,180
the salespeople are like very money motivated, like go getter type people who are very like sly and

555
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:56,020
shyster type people who built America. So they're exactly like me is what you're saying. Only better

556
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,620
in every way, Ben. Right. Only they can actually do their job. My dad's a super honest guy. He's like

557
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,480
the opposite problem right there. But here's the way that that one of his friends who he met in the

558
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,840
car business, who both of them went on to become general managers, he's he described my dad's

559
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:16,880
technique as talking at people until they're so confused that they just buy the damn car. Oh, yeah.

560
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,600
He's like me where he'll just keep rambling on and on about it. And then eventually, oh my god,

561
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,320
you're talking about fine. K on his deep Jesus. Imagine as a salesman, Jesus Christ, I would do

562
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,820
anything to shut you the fuck up. I was almost gonna. I almost took that job. My dad almost got

563
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:40,860
me a job as a salesman. But imagine you looking like you do now. Yeah, no way. But yeah, like he

564
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:47,460
he's just a guy who just like wanted to work very badly, applied himself to this job with all he

565
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,700
had. He was employee of the month every fucking month forever, and then rose up the ranks and

566
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,660
became a general manager. And he makes a stupid amount of money. He makes way more money than

567
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,600
anybody else I know, or have ever known or likely will ever know unless I start rich people, you

568
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,520
know, like,

569
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,480
well, we we can't all be managers, though. Right. But the thing is, I'm saying that like, it's

570
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:17,520
possible to to never go to college. And yet, I mean, he, yeah, it's possible. But is it the likely

571
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,960
outcome for most people? Well, you know, what also isn't the likely outcome for most people doing

572
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,980
anything with your college education, right? Now, here's no one does anything with it. There's

573
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,740
like a lucky few who accomplish anything. That's a bit of an exaggeration. That's not an

574
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:40,940
exaggeration. Almost everyone drops out. You don't go into a field directly related to your major. I

575
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:47,740
mean, I think most people who get degrees still end up in, you know, maybe not necessarily better,

576
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:53,680
but in some thing that needed a degree to get into. Well, then it's kind of worse. Let me cut in

577
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:00,160
for a second. I mean, the what I do for like my tutoring job, I needed a degree to do it, technically

578
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,600
right. All the jobs I had before were things that I only got because I had a degree, like having

579
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,600
a degree. I mean, it's I don't disagree with any of the stuff you're saying to disparage it. But it's

580
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,800
true that having not having a degree disqualifies you from a lot of potential things. But also

581
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,660
disqualifies you is just not having knowledge. Like it like with the electrician job, like you

582
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,300
would be amazed how much that doesn't matter if you have the degree. My current job is a perfect

583
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:31,740
example of that. I just when it comes to getting jobs, it's all about credentials and knowledge is

584
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,540
not a credential. You know how to program. Do you even know what is a program? I do know what is a

585
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,380
program. But the idea was that you come on. That's the amazing thing that I learned, like with some

586
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,520
of these jobs, once you join like a like a real job in a company that like will give you benefits,

587
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,760
all that stuff, they will train you to do the job. So what's even the fucking point of the

588
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,520
education? Well, here's the thing. There's a big there's a big fallacy about in our society that we

589
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,280
had about college degrees that formed over the course of 120 years, right? Now, this is a bit,

590
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,920
this is going to be pretty conjecture, but I'm pretty sure of it. Anyone feel free to correct

591
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,460
me. But okay, back in the day, the 1800s and the early 1900s, having a degree meant that you were

592
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,020
either really privileged or a genius and or an incredibly hard worker, right? And then you were

593
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,580
an exceptional individual, right? Yeah, this is what we now this led to what we call the fallacy

594
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,260
of composition, which is what's true of one person is true of the whole. For example, if you

595
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,340
were in a stadium and you stand up, you can see better. But if everyone stands up, none of nobody

596
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,500
can see better. If everyone runs out of a burning building, they all get stuck. But if one person

597
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,280
runs out, they'll do great. So back in the day, a few people got college degrees. It meant they were

598
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,360
better than everyone else. So you were more hireable. But when everyone has a college degree, it no

599
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,480
longer means you're exceptional. It means you're hopefully competent. So now all it's done is it's

600
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,520
created this artificial need to have a degree just to prove that you're even like capable of doing

601
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,080
anything. So now it's like we've basically we've duped our society has duped ourselves into you

602
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:09,380
have dozens of thousands of dollars in debt to be proven as competence. And that's a pretty messed

603
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:15,740
up. Alright, alright, alright, let me tell you my story now. Alright, my story is the most. It's the

604
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,540
worst thing about my life, my relationship with my with my higher education. So I to went to high

605
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,780
school, same school as Ben was two years younger than him. And then I went to college with the dream

606
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,080
of becoming a doctor. So I went to school in New Jersey, with a aiming for a biology degree or

607
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:41,240
something, then to go to medical school later. So two years into that, I decided I don't want to do

608
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,200
that anymore. I want to be a computer science major, which was fine. Now, the biggest problem

609
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:54,000
along this whole thing was that I met with my advisor, like every year to make sure I was taking

610
00:50:54,020 --> 00:51:00,260
the right classes. Nobody along that way ever informed me that no matter what I did, I would not

611
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,940
be taking enough classes to graduate on time. So when I hit that four year mark, you know, I was

612
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,460
aware I'd have to do more. But I didn't think it would be much. I thought it'd be like a year. And

613
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,180
now I'm sitting here. Well, okay, I'm doing okay now. But basically, after after everybody, all my

614
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:21,420
buddies graduated, I then spent I went back to Massachusetts, spent, what is it now, three years,

615
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:28,320
spent three years taking like a course or two a semester, working at these shitty jobs, paying

616
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,960
student loans at this point, I've got I've got like $20,000 of debt or something, haven't made a

617
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,120
fucking debt in the thing, been taking these disgusting, horrific jobs. The only thing that made

618
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,840
my life bearable was when I discovered YouTube and started doing tbap and stuff. Those were the

619
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,200
only things in life that gave me joy. My I lived with my parents, I got zero to almost no

620
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:57,380
puss during that time. After college, my my my hunger had awoken. It was a nightmare. And

621
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,100
have just been treading water ever since until miraculously, and this is what really

622
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,180
infuriates me. The only way I got out of this was just that my dad has had a has a good family

623
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:13,260
friend who just who just basically made a decree, give this kid a job at your company in Ohio. So

624
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,180
here I am, here I am with the job because it was handed to me. It's not like I earned the privilege

625
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:24,680
alert privilege alert. I was but that's the thing. I obviously I was I was super privileged,

626
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,640
but that should not be how it is. No one should this whole I mean, that's how it is with me too. I

627
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,200
have super privilege alert like I could just I could just move away for like five years and come

628
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,800
back and immediately start I know I don't want an unfair advantage. I don't want that for anyone. I

629
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,440
got like, like, it is kind of fucked up that like after going through all of that and that's the

630
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,500
thing. That's the thing. You get a degree that supposedly gets you a job. You just like, you

631
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:57,900
know, because we have this family friend. Yeah, just get you just get one. Like, and I'm just

632
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:04,060
juxtaposing my life. Yeah. And I'm juxtaposing my life for those three years with no more credentials

633
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,980
than I have now. Just suddenly someone just like gave me an opportunity. And now I'm doing just

634
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,980
fine. Now my life is like pretty decent, I guess. But like, there's no difference between those two

635
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,360
states of being other than someone decided to hand me shit. Like, do you understand how

636
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:24,120
frustrating that is? It's a nightmare. And my fuck like I've had all these problems. I've had all

637
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,920
these fucking problems like getting credits to count with like the school. And like I took a

638
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,880
class. It wasn't actually approved. That's thousands of dollars down the drain. Every time that

639
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,000
happens. I hate school so much no one should ever go if you're going to go people for the love of

640
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:44,180
God. Have a plan. Don't go because you think you want to figure out who you are. You're going to

641
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:48,100
waste tens of thousands of dollars. Just go get a job and figure out who you are. Figure out that

642
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,860
you want to do YouTube. Figure out that uploading videos makes you happier than anything else you've

643
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,460
done. Find a group of people who respect you and that you love and who are your best friends.

644
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,580
Don't go to school. Don't do it to yourself. So hang yourself for the rest of your life.

645
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,780
Ben, I believe you asked me earlier, like, are you in favor of homeschooling? I'm just in favor

646
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,600
of total, like, libertarian school choice. Just like, like the parents have to evaluate the kid

647
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,560
and decide what they think would be best. Like, okay, here's a world that I want, right? Well,

648
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,880
maybe doing math and they're not doing good at it. And then they try again, and they still suck at

649
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,000
it. And they try again, they still suck at it. Get out of math and take the kid exactly. Exactly.

650
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,240
They go, All right. Hey, guess what? You get to give up now. I would love nothing better than to

651
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,520
give up because like the thing is my parents ultimately weren't that good at homeschooling

652
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,700
because they didn't know how to do it. They were both raised. Yeah, they were newcomers too. They

653
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,220
didn't know how to do it, right? You know, especially back in the 90s, it was, I think, you

654
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:46,340
know, so it was a more new thing than it is now, obviously. How I want to do with with my kids at

655
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:51,020
least, at least at the beginning, when they're like little, is just sit them down and talk with

656
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,660
them for hours. Because I remember sometimes like talking with my dad about like, history stuff,

657
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,620
and then we like go on Wikipedia and we, I don't know, Wikipedia at the time, but we'd go on the

658
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,600
internet, look something up. That would be a perfectly fine way to like, teach your kids stuff.

659
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,160
It's just like, hang out with them for hours a day or, you know, however much time you have, and

660
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,960
just talk to them and read books and Wikipedia articles. Well, obviously, the thing about that is

661
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,520
the reason most people, the biggest reason we have public schools is because most people can't

662
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,840
raise their own kids. Yeah, yeah. Well, we got, we're trying to compartmentalize the time that

663
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,000
parents, you know, so they can grind out the corporate machine and, you know, make America

664
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,620
more money and stuff. Right. Which is the biggest fallacy in it.

665
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Cat begged to get into my room. I got up. I took my headphones off, let her in, and she

666
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:41,100
immediately wants to go back out. You know, I like to think you're referring to like a woman

667
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,100
from the 1950s. Yo, this cat wanted into my room and now she won't even put out. What's up with

668
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,420
this garbage? Man, I'm still just sitting here just quivering with sorrow and anger from your

669
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,900
story, Nate. I'm glad. Good. Yeah. It's terrifying. Good. Don't do it, people. Learn from my

670
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,120
mistakes. Let's look at it this way. It's like you decide to drop out of math. Just drop out of

671
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,320
all the degrees. Let's say like, well, I like, well, hold on. Like I like history or I like

672
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,200
science. You can do a little bit of that stuff. But you know what I really want to do as a seven

673
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,880
year old? A song and dance man? I really love the piano. I want to play piano. All right. You can

674
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,600
just drop. I mean, not me. I'm just saying like some other kid. This is like a figure of

675
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,080
speech. I don't play the, I don't do music. This is just an anecdote, a false anecdote that

676
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,060
doesn't exist. Okay. It could be, right? This kid wants to play piano. It's like, okay, well,

677
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,020
let's say if you drop out of school entirely and don't do any work other than like a little bit

678
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:35,660
that you want, you could do five hours of piano a day. And that's six days a week. And

679
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:40,780
actually it would be seven if we killed God and you could go do it on Sunday. But let's just

680
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,740
say that we don't kill God. Yeah. Let's say there's a couple of weeks you'll take off. So

681
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,000
that's 50 weeks a year. And then what if that was the plan of a JRPG, a bunch of Japanese

682
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,880
friends get together and use the power of friendship to kill God so that they can work on

683
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,480
Sunday.

684
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,600
And then they celebrate by going to Chick-fil-A on Sunday. Yeah. By the time that kid is 17

685
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:15,360
around the same age, he'd be graduating high school. He'd have 15,000 hours of playing

686
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,700
piano. That's genius.

687
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,660
Ben, before you say that, just let me say that that is what my life is currently. I have to go to

688
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,060
work. Well, I see you and Digi every day working on making better and better videos and doing so

689
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:35,340
well. Not only am I not like working at the same rate, like not only am I not currently as

690
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,780
successful as you, you guys are like accelerating faster than me while I have to go grind away my

691
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,460
life at this job that I hate because I can't leave because I can't make enough money. We'll make

692
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,680
this a separate podcast. I'm so envious of you. We will do a podcast about this whole topic.

693
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,360
Nate, how... It's a trap. You see, my job is a trap. It was all a nightmare. I'm living in a nightmare.

694
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,480
If you subtract your debt from all the money you have, what are you left with?

695
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,480
Well, that's kind of a personal question, dude.

696
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:09,160
Well, I... No, I don't mind. I might, like with all the money, which includes stuff I have to spend

697
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,960
to live, like maybe it would have equaled out by now.

698
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,660
No, I mean, I mean, like right now currently... Oh, right.

699
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,460
I mean, I'm doing all right. I'm doing okay.

700
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,860
Does you having debt mean that you ultimately have negative money? Do you have an amount of debt that would

701
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,260
equal negative money? Yes, yes, I do. That is correct.

702
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,460
And Ben, I assume the same is true for you. It is true for me.

703
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:34,460
I have $9,000 sitting in my bank and no debt and perfect credit.

704
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm coming for you, Digi.

705
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,960
Yeah, one of these days. All right, Ben, you were saying something.

706
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,460
Oh, fuck. Shit. What was I talking about when I was going to break in there?

707
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,460
I don't know, but I could... You better hurry, because I'm going to go on my ranch.

708
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Well, move on, because I forget what I was going to say.

709
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,460
All right, all right. Forgive me.

710
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Yeah, man, I'm like... I think we need to restructure all this shit. I think that...

711
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,460
I agree, man.

712
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:04,460
Because here's the thing. I think that for the vast majority of people, what school is, is daycare, right?

713
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,460
Yeah, yes, totally.

714
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,960
And your parents don't have the skill set to raise you or, I mean, to teach you things.

715
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,960
They're fucking parents. They probably didn't even finish school themselves, right?

716
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,460
I mean, like, what are you learning in, like, elementary school?

717
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,960
Like, when you're there and you're all sitting at desks and there's 30 of you and the teacher is talking to you for...

718
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,960
Like, do you really think you're there, like, learning every day?

719
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Well, you know, guys, the one upside of this whole thing is that with, you know, automation, AI stuff and all, like, individual computing,

720
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,460
school is probably going to have a revolution in the next few years that makes it way more...

721
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,460
Whoa, that's a whole other mess. I'm going to get into later.

722
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,460
We should bring that back.

723
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:46,460
Let me tell you my story before everybody interrupts this with the fucking AI stuff.

724
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,460
What were you saying? What did I say?

725
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,960
I said that's way optimistic to think that there's actually going to be that...

726
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,460
There should be that revolution, but I really doubt it.

727
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,960
So anyway, school is daycare, right?

728
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,960
And you send your kids off there, they learn...

729
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:09,960
It's a way for them to not be around your house in danger all day and also they happen to probably be learning something

730
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,960
and maybe making friends and learning how to socialize.

731
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,460
Pretty good system, right?

732
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
Here's the thing.

733
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,460
At some point, you...

734
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Like, when you're growing up, especially when you...

735
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,960
Pretty much when you reach puberty, when you're getting into high school.

736
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Like, personally, I think that the existence of elementary and middle school is pretty justified.

737
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,460
Yeah, I agree.

738
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,460
Kids need to learn some basic shit.

739
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,460
Kids are worthless trash and they need to be held in line.

740
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,460
I do think that we're probably...

741
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,960
We could better optimize what we're teaching kids.

742
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
I honestly think...

743
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
I don't get why...

744
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Like, okay, in fucking high school is the first time you can even have any classes that are just life skill classes

745
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
and they're always electives.

746
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,960
Like, home ec.

747
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,460
Like, why is home ec not like a mandatory middle school class?

748
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,460
They never learned anything useful in home ec.

749
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,460
Yeah, but that might just be because...

750
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,460
I just meant that...

751
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,460
Okay, I wasn't actually talking about...

752
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,460
I didn't mean literal home ec.

753
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,460
I just meant, like, that's the kind of subject.

754
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,460
Learn to cook is a good skill, though.

755
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,460
Everyone's gotta eat skill.

756
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
I think everyone needs to learn how to cook.

757
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,460
Everyone needs to learn how to fucking build shit and build a car.

758
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:23,460
We brought this up in me and Ben's podcast that I was saying that we could just make a whole class

759
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,460
around learning how to fix machines.

760
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:31,460
Learn computers, make a class about building computers in middle school.

761
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,460
Mandatory.

762
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Everyone needs to know this now.

763
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,460
And most important of all, most important of all, there's sex education.

764
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,460
Why isn't there dating education class?

765
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,460
Why isn't there dating education?

766
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:45,460
I mean, once you go on three dates, you have sex, but how do you get those first three dates?

767
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,460
You gotta find out.

768
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,460
We need to teach a school.

769
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,460
How do you ask a girl out?

770
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,460
They were up to me.

771
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,460
This is a Chris Chanism, by the way.

772
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:59,460
I would say that the elementary school, we teach them all the basic shit they need to know.

773
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Middle school, we continue to teach basic shit, and then we throw in a heaping helping of life skills,

774
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,460
which I mean, there's some in there.

775
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,460
That's when you start getting sex education and stuff like that.

776
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,460
But it needs to be a lot more.

777
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,460
We just stop beating around the bush with the sex shit and just teach kids straight up what the fuck it is.

778
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:20,460
I've got friends who get taught what's up, and they're much more well-adjusted.

779
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,460
We need sex in the culture and whatever.

780
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,460
Kids, we're going to stop beating around the bush.

781
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,460
We're going to beat directly on the bus.

782
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,460
Oh, god damn!

783
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:38,460
And we need some education on how to get a job and maintain the job and how to just be a working person.

784
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,460
I don't think you can teach that.

785
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,460
That might be true.

786
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,460
That might be true.

787
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,460
That's a complicated and diverse skill set.

788
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:51,460
One of my offline friends was really screwed over for a year because of that lack of being taught how to get a job.

789
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,460
When you're a kid, you see people working behind the counter at McDonald's, right?

790
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,460
And you know you aren't supposed to walk behind that counter, right?

791
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
That's not where you belong.

792
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Some kids have a hard time even ordering at McDonald's because it feels like some social thing they're not supposed to do yet until they're older, right?

793
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,460
It's this boundary that you're not allowed to cross.

794
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,460
When you're a kid, you think of anyone who has any sort of job as someone who probably has some sort of amazing skill.

795
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,460
How do they know what all the burgers cost?

796
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,460
Oh my gosh, right?

797
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Yeah.

798
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
So you have that mentality.

799
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:23,460
And when you're like 20 and your parents are telling you you have to get a job, which was the case for one of my friends,

800
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,460
I feel like a part of her problem was just general anxiety.

801
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,460
But I think a lot of it was how do you go up and say you have a job?

802
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,460
How does this work?

803
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,460
How?

804
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,460
Wow!

805
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,460
Okay.

806
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,460
I kind of know what you're talking about.

807
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,460
Here's the thing.

808
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,460
And we kind of did a little bit of this in elementary school,

809
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:50,460
but it would be even better if we just had a school trip where we all went to McDonald's or to a bunch of restaurants,

810
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,460
and we all just sat in the kitchen for a while and just watched what people do.

811
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,460
Oh, I see.

812
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,460
Just learn the basic shit of what's going on.

813
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,460
If you were coming here, this could be you one day, kids.

814
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,460
It would be the worst day ever for everyone who works at the McDonald's,

815
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,460
but it would help sprout better careers in the future.

816
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,460
In the Boy Scouts, we did that at a Dunkin' Donuts.

817
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,460
Oh, that's cool.

818
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,460
Good idea.

819
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,460
And I also was in the Boy Scouts.

820
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,460
Oh, yeah, I was a Boy Scout by the way.

821
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,460
Eagle Scout over here, Eagle Scout.

822
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,460
That's me.

823
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,460
Yeah, I never made it to Eagle Scout.

824
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,460
By the way, this is a big millennial thing.

825
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,460
I'm an Eagle Scout because my dad basically forced me to do it,

826
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,460
so I take almost no credit for it.

827
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:33,460
Anyways, I think we need success skills, general life skills.

828
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,460
And computer programming.

829
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:40,460
I can't even fucking fathom that at no point in all of schooling,

830
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:46,460
at any point, I went to fucking 12 years of regular school,

831
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,460
two years of college, and at no point did someone teach me

832
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,460
what taxes are and how to do them.

833
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,460
Oh, my God.

834
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,460
How the fuck is that?

835
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,460
How the fuck?

836
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,460
The education system is a little bit too wedded

837
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,460
to the Aristotelian model of learning general knowledge.

838
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,460
People, we need to know how to do our taxes.

839
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,460
How the fuck?

840
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,460
Every single person in America has to do it.

841
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,460
It's a government mandated thing, like you can go to jail

842
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,460
for not doing it.

843
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,460
Not really, most people who are employees, the taxes get done for them.

844
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,460
That is not true.

845
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,460
I'm an employee at a company and you've got to file your fucking taxes every time.

846
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,460
Okay, maybe that's not the case anymore,

847
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,460
but I know it's the case for a lot of people.

848
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
No, everyone has to file taxes.

849
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,460
Everyone has to follow.

850
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,460
Literally everyone.

851
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,460
Yeah.

852
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,460
Okay, well I don't know what the heck I've heard then.

853
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,460
I know I've always had to file them.

854
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,460
The thing is to do, everyone has to file them.

855
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,460
It's if you have a normal job,

856
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,460
which I realize you've never had like a really normal job.

857
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:45,460
If you have a normal job, then your company takes out a certain amount of your paycheck every time.

858
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,460
And they give it to the government.

859
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:53,460
And then at the end of the year, you file a tax form that tells you how much they took out,

860
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
and then they give most of it back.

861
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,460
However, if you're a fucking freelancer like me,

862
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,460
you have to figure out, all on your own,

863
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:08,460
the fact that you have to pay like a third of what you made last year to the government,

864
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,460
because no one took it out for you.

865
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,460
So you have to figure out how to give them the money.

866
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,460
And they don't tell you.

867
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,460
I mean, they invariate terms.

868
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,460
Nobody tells you.

869
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,460
Yeah, no one's like, hey buddy, just so you know,

870
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,460
tax season coming up, here's what you have to do.

871
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,460
Dude, I'm just...

872
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,460
No, they don't tell you.

873
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,460
I just knew because I knew what taxes were through television.

874
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,460
I guess it's the thing your parents tell you.

875
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,460
I mean, that's how I learned because my parents taught me shit.

876
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,460
My parents are like...

877
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:38,460
Your parents aren't like sole proprietors of their own business.

878
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,460
They work at places, so it's a different system.

879
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,460
And they also...

880
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,460
My parents are like...

881
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,460
They have a difficulty...

882
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,460
They've always had this.

883
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,460
A difficulty of realizing what stuff they know that is not obvious.

884
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,460
You know what I mean?

885
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,460
Sure, okay.

886
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,460
They, for whatever reason, assume that me, Victor, and Shade

887
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:59,460
would learn certain things that we don't know anything about.

888
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,460
You know, I kind of feel that as I'm getting older

889
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,460
and people are more retarded, as I see younger people,

890
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,460
it's hard to know.

891
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,460
It's really...

892
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,460
I have some sympathy for that

893
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,460
because I don't know that these fucking kids don't know what like,

894
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,460
I don't know, a VHS tape is.

895
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,460
Right.

896
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,460
Some shit like that.

897
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,460
You know, whatever.

898
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,460
Yeah, it's like you take certain things for granted

899
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,460
because you know how to do them

900
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,460
because you've been doing them forever.

901
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:23,460
But like, I have no idea how my parents learned how to do taxes

902
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,460
but it wasn't until like, I had to pay taxes

903
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,460
and I came to my parents like,

904
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,460
what the fuck do I do?

905
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,460
There's some things that were like expected to absorb

906
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,460
through like the osmosis of life.

907
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,460
I mean, I always assumed that the fact that I didn't absorb those things

908
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,460
like how to do taxes, like how to hold it regularly,

909
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,460
I always just assumed that I was just a little autistic

910
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,460
and that I was just this wrong.

911
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,460
No, no one learns this stuff.

912
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,460
No one teaches you it.

913
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,460
I mean, control the spectrum.

914
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,460
I just figured I was a little more on the spectrum

915
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,460
and everyone else figured it out.

916
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,460
I know exactly what you mean, Ben.

917
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,460
And I think everyone assumes that they are the idiot.

918
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,460
Like, I must be the idiot.

919
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,460
I kind of remember the figures around my dick quote.

920
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,460
Well, I must be the idiot here

921
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,460
because I had it in my head

922
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,460
that the tunnel between demon world and human world

923
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,460
had been sealed.

924
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,460
No.

925
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:21,460
I think everyone just assumes that there's certain shit

926
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,460
because I've had that experience plenty of times

927
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,460
where I'll have a friend who I might say something like,

928
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,460
oh, this is how much is minimum wage or something

929
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:32,460
because I have no idea.

930
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:37,460
Or I'll ask somebody like, hey, what's a huge question I had all my life

931
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,460
and I only learned it in the last couple of years

932
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:42,460
is what is a normal amount of money to make?

933
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,460
I have no idea.

934
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,460
Well, there's no real answer to that question.

935
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,460
When you fill out those surveys,

936
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,460
because I used to buy a lot of DVDs

937
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,460
and they would come with these little surveys

938
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,460
that you're supposed to mail in.

939
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,460
And I never would mail them.

940
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,460
I would just fill them out because I'm a fucking weirdo.

941
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,460
So I filled out all these surveys

942
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:04,460
and they would always have a question that's like,

943
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,460
what is your house's annual income?

944
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,460
And I had no idea

945
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,460
because I don't know what my fucking parents make.

946
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,460
I don't even know that shit.

947
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,460
Yeah, and so I would just stare at it

948
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,460
and I'd be like, well, what's normal?

949
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,460
Because it has this enormous gradient

950
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:23,460
from like $12,000 at the bottom to $250,000 at the top.

951
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,460
And I had no concept of how much money is $12,000

952
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,460
versus how much money is $250,000.

953
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,460
Oh, well, you're a kid, sure.

954
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,460
I really didn't grasp it until I had money.

955
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,460
And it was really the moment when I started,

956
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,460
like once I got up to like minimum wage,

957
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,460
like through Target and then through YouTube,

958
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,460
like then I would look at,

959
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,460
like I found out how much my dad makes

960
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,460
and like did the comparison that it was like 30 times

961
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,460
what I was making and I was like, oh,

962
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,460
so he does make a lot of money.

963
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,460
Oh, so this is like, this is what entry level is.

964
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,460
This is what most people are making, like this amount,

965
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,460
this is minimum wage, this is the common amount.

966
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,460
Like, oh my God, now I understand what money is,

967
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,460
you know, but it took so long and like so many years

968
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,460
of not getting it and like my entire appreciation

969
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,460
of what my parents were doing all this time

970
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,460
would have been totally different.

971
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,460
If I had any understanding of money,

972
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,460
it would have totally changed my perspective on things.

973
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,460
I guess I thought that those things

974
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
and understanding all that normal stuff

975
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:30,460
just comes as a part of like following the,

976
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:34,460
like the quote unquote natural, quote unquote normal,

977
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,460
like life progression as I saw it.

978
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,460
I thought that if I just like followed the standard model,

979
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,460
you know, high school, four years of college,

980
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,460
you know, get a job or go into graduate school

981
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,460
because I intended to go to graduate school

982
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,460
and get my PhD when I was in college.

983
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,460
That's what I wanted to do.

984
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,460
But yeah, no, they don't really tell you that stuff.

985
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,460
Let me tell you a little bit about my like,

986
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,460
my emotional relationship with education.

987
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,460
Like when I started college

988
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,460
and through most of my college life,

989
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,460
I honestly saw the institution of education and learning

990
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,460
with an almost like religious reverence.

991
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,460
Interesting.

992
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,460
I thought that it was like,

993
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,460
that like a college was a place where people go to learn

994
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,460
and learning was like sacred.

995
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,460
Like I was into it.

996
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,460
I was like, this is a beautiful magical thing.

997
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,460
And then like I graduated college

998
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,460
and I got a job, you know,

999
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,460
my first real job was working as a teacher at Astro Camp

1000
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,460
and it was like just a bunch of fucking kids

1001
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,460
walking around asking me dumb questions

1002
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
and I had a little lesson thing I had to go through

1003
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,460
and like, oh, here I'll show you this dumb demonstration

1004
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,460
where I fill up a balloon with hydrogen

1005
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,460
and blow it up in a big old fireball.

1006
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,460
Here we go.

1007
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Yeah, whatever, it was bullshit.

1008
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,460
And then I went and I fucking,

1009
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,460
now I'm a physics tutor and I went

1010
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,460
and I was taught in Poland for a while,

1011
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,460
taught college level physics classes

1012
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,460
and it was like the same thing.

1013
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,460
It was the same as teaching kids this dumb crap.

1014
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,460
I was just some idiot up at the board.

1015
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,460
I had a lesson, I would go through it.

1016
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,460
Like kids would sometimes pause the lesson

1017
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,460
and ask me a question and I'd be,

1018
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,460
you know, sometimes I could answer the question

1019
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,460
but I like, I can't stop the lesson

1020
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,460
just because one kid doesn't understand.

1021
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,460
So I could just, I could try to explain a little bit,

1022
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,460
but mostly I just like what you said before,

1023
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,460
did you like just talking at someone

1024
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,460
until they're so confused that they buy the car anyway?

1025
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,460
I would just have to kind of think of some like

1026
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,460
quick way to respond to the question

1027
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,460
that was truthful and honest,

1028
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,460
but like just get them to like think that they understood

1029
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,460
in the hopes that I could then continue the lesson

1030
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,460
and they would hopefully go and look at it

1031
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,460
on their notes later.

1032
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,460
Education just is way too generalized.

1033
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,460
The thing is, I honestly felt like,

1034
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,460
I felt weirdly embarrassed

1035
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,460
about teaching this class because I knew,

1036
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,460
like this was all stuff I learned in college

1037
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,460
and it was in the textbook.

1038
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,460
I was always thinking to myself,

1039
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,460
why are these kids even showing up to my classes

1040
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,460
and being taught in a classroom setting by me?

1041
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,460
Why don't they just go home and read the textbook?

1042
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,460
It's all in the textbook.

1043
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,460
I do not have any special knowledge

1044
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,460
that I'm sharing with them.

1045
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,460
I don't even know why I'm here

1046
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,460
and yet I was just expected to.

1047
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,460
You say all the right things, Ben.

1048
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,460
So now I've been totally,

1049
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,460
I've been very much disillusioned with the idea

1050
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,460
of that like college,

1051
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,460
like classroom setting learning,

1052
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,460
like now I kind of don't even understand it anymore

1053
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,460
after having done it.

1054
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,460
After having been on the other side of the equation.

1055
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,460
That part where you said

1056
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,460
like you can't pause the whole lesson

1057
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,460
and understand like that brings us to the whole subject

1058
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,460
of tests and stuff like, okay,

1059
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,460
let's just deconstruct the whole education system.

1060
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,460
Let's say it doesn't exist. Let's say it's 2,000 years ago

1061
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,460
we need to invent school and like,

1062
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,460
let's just imagine we're in the board of directors

1063
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,460
where they invent school and they're like,

1064
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,460
but wait a second, what if kids are just sitting

1065
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,460
in the class and never paying attention?

1066
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,460
How can we determine that they're paying attention?

1067
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,460
Well, we'll have these pieces of paper

1068
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,460
where they have to write out their correct answers

1069
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,460
and then however many they get right becomes a percentage

1070
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,460
and then we evaluate them based on the percentage

1071
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,460
like, okay, that's obviously how that got invented.

1072
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,460
But think about just how inefficient that is

1073
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,460
because all you have to,

1074
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,460
all you can worry about at school

1075
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,460
is how can I

1076
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,460
know just the right amount

1077
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,460
of information in just the right ways

1078
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,460
to get that percentage.

1079
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,460
And that's like the number one thing everyone is worried about

1080
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,460
at all times and it's the most inefficient way

1081
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,460
to learn things and let me just say this,

1082
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,460
this is for me the number one thing to say.

1083
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,460
If the internet existed

1084
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,460
on the day they came together

1085
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,460
to invent school,

1086
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,460
they wouldn't have invented school.

1087
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,460
If the internet existed, there would have been no point.

1088
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,460
School was invented back when most people

1089
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,460
couldn't even write books.

1090
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,460
It's an antiquated system.

1091
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,460
Back when these books were almost impossible to come by.

1092
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,460
You don't need it now.

1093
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,460
It's based on a totally antiquated mindset

1094
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,460
from a time before, yeah, you're right.

1095
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,460
Oh, this gets to the number one.

1096
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,460
Okay, this is the other thing I've got to talk about.

1097
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,460
Nolan Bushnell, creator of Atari, father of video games.

1098
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,460
In an interview one time

1099
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,460
he was talking about his history with Atari

1100
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,460
and the things that he accomplished

1101
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,460
and the things he was disappointed about.

1102
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,460
And he said the number one thing

1103
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,460
that he was disappointed about

1104
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,460
that didn't come together the way that he wanted to.

1105
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,460
This is a guy who failed a lot.

1106
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,460
This is a guy who fell from glory in the 80s.

1107
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,460
But the number one thing that didn't go the way

1108
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,460
he wanted to was educational games.

1109
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,460
There's educational games,

1110
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,460
but they're all boring, most of them,

1111
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,460
except Oregon Trail and a couple other classics.

1112
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,460
Using gaming

1113
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,460
and computer programs as a form of education

1114
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,460
never took off in the way that he wanted to.

1115
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,460
Obviously, you know, video games

1116
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,460
took off like wildfire.

1117
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,460
Well, I don't know about that. I played Oregon Trail.

1118
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,460
I think educational games are as good

1119
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,460
as they need to be.

1120
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,460
Well, the fact that they didn't just overwhelm

1121
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,460
the way that we do education is a pretty big failure.

1122
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,460
I think he was probably hoping the world would be transformed

1123
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,460
into smart people or something by video games.

1124
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,460
Here's the thing. I'm about to get very libertarian here.

1125
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,460
He said that the reason why it wasn't allowed

1126
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,460
to happen was because

1127
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,460
of teachers' unions who don't want to be replaced

1128
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,460
by computers.

1129
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,460
And the way in teaching is so...

1130
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,460
Oh, fuck.

1131
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,460
That is making me write the fuck off.

1132
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,460
Did I mention that B having been

1133
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,460
a teacher gave me a lot less respect

1134
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,460
for teachers?

1135
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,460
I know it's an unpopular opinion.

1136
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,460
You're supposed to pedestalize teachers and say that,

1137
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,460
oh, they have the most important job.

1138
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,460
I mean, there are some good teachers

1139
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,460
who are really passionate and go above and beyond,

1140
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,460
but I think in general I do not consider

1141
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,460
teaching to be a noble profession

1142
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,460
in and of itself.

1143
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,460
So here's the thing. Education is such an institutionalized

1144
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,460
thing, at least in America.

1145
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,460
It's one of those...

1146
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,460
I think now that all the other unions are going

1147
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,460
by the wayside, the teachers' union is one of the strongest.

1148
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,460
You can't get anything done.

1149
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,460
They're so set in their ways

1150
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,460
and so many of them are so old with these

1151
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,460
30-year pensions.

1152
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,460
Innovation is ridiculously hard.

1153
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,460
And Nolan Bushnell was saying

1154
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,460
first-hand that...

1155
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,460
Dude, we're going to get an iPad in every class.

1156
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,460
Every desk.

1157
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,460
It's happening, but the fact that we didn't get an iPad

1158
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,460
in every class, like one month after

1159
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,460
the iPad came out, means that

1160
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,460
there's this one very

1161
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,460
creepy libertarian podcast called

1162
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,460
Freakonomics that I listened to a couple episodes of

1163
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,460
and they made a great point, which was

1164
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,460
if you were to travel from the year 1890 to today,

1165
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
almost everything would be different.

1166
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Everything works differently, but

1167
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,460
except schools. They still basically look

1168
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,460
the same way they did 130 years ago.

1169
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,460
Hey, you know they got the same fucking buildings

1170
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:14,460
a lot of the time.

1171
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,460
A lot of them were the same people still teaching.

1172
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,460
Yeah.

1173
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,460
Dude, I got a...

1174
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,460
Here's an anecdote. From the 70s, they built schools

1175
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,460
without windows, because apparently that would allow you

1176
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,460
to focus better. But then I guess a couple of

1177
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,460
children just got a little bit crazy

1178
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,460
from that and they stopped that whole trend.

1179
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,460
Someone in Japan built a window

1180
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,460
on the side of a classroom and some anime character

1181
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,460
sat next to it and everything

1182
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,460
was different from then on.

1183
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,460
That's right. Alright. Well, I want to get into

1184
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,460
since Ben went into his

1185
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,460
emotional relationship with schooling, I have to

1186
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,460
do mine too. Because I want to paint

1187
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,460
this picture of why I feel so

1188
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,460
negatively about the school system.

1189
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,460
Because I think

1190
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,460
I have uniquely been

1191
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,460
failed and am surrounded by people

1192
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,460
who have been failed by

1193
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,460
school.

1194
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,460
Oh man, yeah.

1195
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,460
Starting with myself. See,

1196
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,460
my mom raised me to

1197
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,460
be extremely

1198
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,460
grade oriented.

1199
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,460
She was very

1200
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,460
disappointed if I made a C

1201
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,460
and she would reward me highly if I made

1202
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,460
A's and B's.

1203
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,460
I had this mindset of anything below a C

1204
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,460
is a titanic failure.

1205
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,460
We kind of did too.

1206
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,460
When I was in 8th grade, I think

1207
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,460
I got my first D

1208
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,460
or F on one report card.

1209
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,460
Didn't even fail the class, but I

1210
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,460
carried it like a

1211
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,460
fucking noose around my neck that I had

1212
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,460
gotten at that grade.

1213
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,460
The same thing happened to me in 5th grade.

1214
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,460
I got like a 50 on a test for some

1215
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,460
reason and I was distraught. I banged

1216
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,460
my head on the blackboard in class

1217
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,460
and like just, yeah.

1218
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,460
I was fucked up.

1219
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,460
I had this experience where when I was in elementary

1220
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,460
school, for the first few years

1221
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,460
everyone, like my mom

1222
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,460
and my dad and my teachers were all convinced I

1223
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,460
was a genius.

1224
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,460
If only they could have known

1225
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,460
how wrong they were.

1226
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,460
I would do really well in every subject.

1227
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,460
I was really great at schooling.

1228
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,460
In the 2nd grade, they put me in

1229
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,460
a gifted program they had at the school

1230
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,460
where it's just like they did a little

1231
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,460
extra mile stuff.

1232
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,460
Then they had a whole gifted school

1233
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,460
like the advanced learning school and they

1234
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,460
were like, alright, when I went into 3rd grade

1235
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,460
they put me there.

1236
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,460
What very quickly became apparent

1237
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,460
was I was not good enough for the school

1238
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,460
because the school is for people who are

1239
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,460
I think honestly I could

1240
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,460
partially maybe blame my mom

1241
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,460
for just not understanding the way

1242
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,460
that studying works because she would

1243
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,460
just tell me to sit at the table and not

1244
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,460
stop working until I was

1245
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,460
done and I would never do it.

1246
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,460
I would just sit there and stare at my work

1247
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,460
and like not, you know.

1248
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,460
Same. I was a big procrastinator.

1249
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,460
Even back then I was a procrastinator.

1250
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,460
Me too. I was all about putting off my work.

1251
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,460
I never wanted to get my homework done.

1252
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,460
I would just wait and wait and say fuck.

1253
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,460
I was in 3rd and 4th grade at this gifted

1254
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,460
school. I was not doing as well

1255
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,460
and particularly in 4th grade and my teacher

1256
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,460
was a huge bitch, right?

1257
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,460
Here's the thing. I ended up

1258
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,460
halfway through 4th grade I dropped back

1259
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,460
down to regular school and at this point

1260
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,460
I had been

1261
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,460
bullied a lot as well

1262
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,460
at both that school and when I went back

1263
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,460
to the normal one. They'd push you down

1264
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,460
and say, enemies of Japanese colloquialism.

1265
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,460
No.

1266
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,460
They'd take my glasses

1267
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,460
for, you know, just fuck with me

1268
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
and just call me a girl because I look like a girl.

1269
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,460
But they, you know,

1270
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,460
I dropped out of that

1271
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,460
advanced school and apparently

1272
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,460
I found out later that that teacher

1273
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,460
something like

1274
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,460
6 kids dropped from her

1275
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,460
class and they fired her.

1276
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,460
Because they realized that she was so

1277
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,460
because she was fucking terrible. All she would do

1278
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,460
like if someone, I remember

1279
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,460
several times because there was a kid who dropped

1280
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,460
out of the class before me because

1281
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:56,460
every time he didn't do it, like he would come in

1282
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,460
with no homework or something, the teacher would

1283
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,460
like berate him for 10 minutes

1284
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,460
and he'd be like crying and shit.

1285
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,460
That's a good use of class time.

1286
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,460
Yeah, just like berating this kid and she would give us

1287
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,460
these like assignments that were like

1288
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,460
these insane logic puzzles

1289
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,460
that involved researching shit on the internet

1290
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,460
that we hadn't even learned how to do

1291
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,460
that, you know, and like.

1292
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,460
Dude, quick insertion story

1293
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,460
like so she eventually got fired.

1294
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,460
That is so wonderful to hear because

1295
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,460
my mom tells me these horror stories

1296
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,460
about this woman she works with who's like a teacher

1297
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,460
she's like my mom's the head of the class

1298
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,460
this is like a second level lady but

1299
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,460
this woman is a horrible teacher

1300
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,460
and no one wants to work with her

1301
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,460
but instead of fucking firing her

1302
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,460
they just transfer her from classroom

1303
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,460
to classroom because no one wants to deal with her

1304
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,460
oh is that how we want to handle things

1305
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,460
we've got people that are so bad we just keep moving

1306
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,460
them around instead of just getting rid of them

1307
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,460
I don't understand how people can be bad at their

1308
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,460
jobs and not be fired

1309
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,460
it's like a thing that happens

1310
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:54,460
it's a union thing or something I guess

1311
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,460
I don't know

1312
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,460
well one of it is you don't know

1313
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,460
well hold on I have some experience with

1314
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,460
hiring people because I see my dad doing it

1315
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,460
a lot of it is you don't know if you're going to

1316
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,460
be able to replace them with someone who isn't worse

1317
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,460
that's I think the number one reason why bad people don't use their jobs

1318
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,460
this woman it would be better to have no one

1319
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,460
than to have this particular person

1320
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,460
well I don't know like you have to fill the

1321
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,460
you have to get the kids sitting down for

1322
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,460
a correct amount of time

1323
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,460
further distribute like the time of each

1324
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,460
individual teacher if one person goes

1325
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,460
they'll find some anyway go on

1326
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,460
so anyways to continue my story

1327
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,460
after that experience I kind of became

1328
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,460
disillusioned with the idea that I was

1329
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,460
good at school

1330
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,460
I come up with this idea that I was this genius

1331
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:36,460
and then I had to drop out of the

1332
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,460
fancy school

1333
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,460
and I just wasn't I never did as

1334
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,460
well as I did when I was a little kid

1335
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,460
man that didn't happen to me until college but I wish

1336
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,460
it happened a lot sooner

1337
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,460
well and my parents I just felt like I was a genius

1338
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,460
and then I spent like the rest of

1339
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,460
like regular schooling not believing that

1340
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,460
and I had to get on to YouTube to

1341
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,460
reaffirm my assumptions about myself

1342
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,460
I kind of had a similar thing like I

1343
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,460
you know was in gifted classes and stuff

1344
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,460
and like I really I really saw myself as a smart

1345
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,460
kid and it was a strong

1346
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,460
part of my self image that I was an intelligent

1347
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,460
person and along with and that gave me

1348
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,460
this this like this like religious

1349
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,460
all over learning and institutionalized learning

1350
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,460
and that self image of being a smart

1351
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,460
person I think was a huge factor

1352
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,460
in me being motivated enough to

1353
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,460
do my classwork and like actually yeah

1354
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,460
that's where we're getting those two things fed

1355
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,460
into each other because we got to get to this

1356
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,460
because this is how it all goes down this is where

1357
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,460
the big event happens right so like I

1358
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,460
sort of disillusioned with the idea that

1359
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,460
I'm super smart but I always wanted to

1360
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,460
recapture it you know so like

1361
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,460
in ninth and tenth grade I didn't

1362
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,460
do all that well I was kind of going

1363
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,460
downhill a little bit but I was going into

1364
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,460
eleventh grade and I was like you know what

1365
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,460
I'm gonna pick up like I'm you know college

1366
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,460
is gonna come pretty soon and

1367
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,460
at this point I've been like horribly depressed

1368
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,460
like because my whole teen years were

1369
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,460
spent like depressed as shit and so I was

1370
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,460
just like really desperate for a way to like pick

1371
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,460
myself up and get get into

1372
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,460
the action right so yeah good

1373
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,460
so I was like I wanted

1374
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,460
to there's my school

1375
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,460
had this program where

1376
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:06,460
basically the community colleges near

1377
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,460
here called TCC they have a certain

1378
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,460
building called the ATC building

1379
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,460
where they teach like

1380
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,460
college courses to high school kids

1381
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,460
essentially so right you know if you're

1382
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,460
one of those smarter fast-track kids and

1383
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,460
you want to learn like special skills

1384
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,460
usually involving computers and like

1385
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,460
you know any kind of computer

1386
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,460
related shit they would bust all

1387
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,460
these kids out to this other school

1388
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,460
across town and

1389
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,460
then bust them back at the end of the day

1390
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,460
they would go there like every other day

1391
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,460
so I wanted to do ATC

1392
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,460
so I could learn like some

1393
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,460
I think it was just programming or something

1394
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,460
like wanted to be a video game guy or something

1395
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,460
like that I just wanted to learn some computer skills

1396
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,460
yeah so I signed up for

1397
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,460
ATC and then I also signed up for

1398
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,460
an advanced English class because

1399
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,460
I was particularly good at writing

1400
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,460
I always have been so I

1401
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,460
wanted to you know take an advanced

1402
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,460
course in it so

1403
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,460
I settled like that's the those are

1404
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,460
what that's the thing I applied for

1405
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,460
like I set everything in motion here's the

1406
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,460
thing no one

1407
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,460
at any point contacted me

1408
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,460
to tell me that

1409
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,460
I couldn't do this

1410
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,460
schedule because

1411
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,460
the amount of classes

1412
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:18,460
basically there was like a contradiction in the classes

1413
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,460
I was taking where I had

1414
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,460
like I would have had an overlap or something

1415
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,460
like I had too many like I had

1416
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,460
one class and

1417
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,460
to take

1418
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,460
the ATC thing

1419
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,460
and so I approached

1420
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,460
like I know here's what it was

1421
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,460
it was that when I had first signed up

1422
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,460
for all those classes my I told this to

1423
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,460
my guidance counselor before

1424
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,460
like the 10th grade

1425
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,460
had ended and she had said well

1426
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,460
if you take this course load then you'll have to take

1427
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,460
algebra 2 over the summer

1428
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,460
as a summer school class

1429
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,460
and I said okay that sounds great right

1430
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,460
uh-huh

1431
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,460
summer rolls by

1432
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,460
you know and she meant like the next summer

1433
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,460
I would take it as a class I go to school on the

1434
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,460
first day and no one's contacted me

1435
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,460
at all about how to go to ATC

1436
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,460
I don't know what bus I'm taking

1437
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,460
I don't know where it is

1438
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,460
because I didn't know much about it I'd never done it before

1439
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,460
so no one's told me like how to get there

1440
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,460
so I go to the guidance

1441
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,460
office because I'm just like fucking lost and confused

1442
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,460
and I go to her and I'm like so

1443
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,460
am I doing this ATC thing like am I

1444
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,460
going there and she was like well

1445
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,460
you can't do

1446
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,460
all these classes because they

1447
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:28,460
there's like a whole and I said well I thought

1448
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,460
you said I could do algebra 2 over the summer and she was like

1449
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,460
uhhhh

1450
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,460
no that kind of thing

1451
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,460
so basically on the first

1452
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,460
day of school she asks me

1453
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,460
like you know on the spot

1454
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,460
like you have to either

1455
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,460
drop out of ATC or drop out of

1456
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,460
advanced English and I was just like

1457
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,460
well I guess I'm not doing ATC

1458
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,460
so I didn't do it so

1459
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,460
that was just stricken from my thing right

1460
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,460
so at this point like I'm majorly

1461
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,460
deflated because I have this

1462
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,460
go get her attitude towards 11th grade

1463
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,460
and already half of what I wanted

1464
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,460
to do was gone

1465
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,460
so I start taking the advanced English class

1466
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,460
and at this point I get extremely depressed

1467
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,460
and I hated this class my teacher

1468
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,460
was like really trying to push

1469
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,460
this like feminist agenda and stuff

1470
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,460
and was super into like

1471
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,460
she was like one of those super

1472
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:18,460
um like reading

1473
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,460
all this meaning into the text

1474
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,460
but then you had to like

1475
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,460
like she would teach you that like oh

1476
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:26,460
you can learn you had to read the same meaning

1477
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,460
exactly like that is by far

1478
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,460
the most pissed off I've ever

1479
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,460
been at any curriculum I've ever taken

1480
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,460
like what is this character feeling

1481
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,460
as she gets out of the car and sneezes on the inside

1482
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,460
of her breast pocket depression

1483
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,460
disdain disorder

1484
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,460
distrust I uh

1485
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:44,460
why do I know what you're gonna interpret it as

1486
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,460
who want this

1487
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,460
why is that a thing in school

1488
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,460
that makes no sense

1489
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,460
why is that a thing you can get graded on

1490
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,460
that's a good question

1491
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,460
you just wanted to scream

1492
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,460
I think so too

1493
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,460
I couldn't believe the world

1494
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,460
when I heard that

1495
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,460
like why can we ever

1496
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,460
critique Soviet Russia

1497
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:08,460
or the Nazis or the ancient

1498
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,460
Incans or anyone else

1499
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,460
with their terrible practices

1500
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,460
and their terrible ideologies

1501
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,460
when our society

1502
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,460
can't look down on them when we have

1503
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,460
stuff like that that you're supposed to go over

1504
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,460
but at least we didn't burn all the Jews

1505
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,460
you know we've got that going on

1506
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,460
to finish this story

1507
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,460
but the Nazis had a very

1508
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,460
relativistic view of how the Jews

1509
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:32,460
were feeling

1510
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,460
someone came to my house and said

1511
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,460
go to his gas

1512
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,460
you either have to go to this gas chamber

1513
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,460
or

1514
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,460
answer all these bull crap questions

1515
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,460
about this book

1516
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,460
it would be a hard decision

1517
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,460
so anyways

1518
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,460
I had this advanced English class

1519
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,460
I hated it it was way too much work

1520
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,460
like ten times more than all the other

1521
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,460
classes combined basically

1522
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:58,460
just shit tons of work

1523
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,460
and the teacher was a bitch

1524
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,460
and I hated her and so

1525
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,460
she would assign us like these

1526
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,460
writing assignments based on whatever books we were reading

1527
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,460
and we were like chomping through books in this class

1528
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,460
like every other class would get assigned

1529
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,460
like one book a year this was like

1530
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,460
reading all the time writing all these essays

1531
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,460
like all this really deep

1532
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,460
high-minded stuff and this is the kind of shit

1533
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,460
there was a lot of kids in this class because we only had

1534
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,460
like one advanced placement English class

1535
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,460
but like most of them weren't going to make it

1536
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:26,460
it was like you had to be like a straight

1537
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,460
A student to be a part of the advanced placement classes

1538
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,460
at this school

1539
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,460
so

1540
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,460
at this point I've become extremely depressed

1541
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,460
I don't care about anything

1542
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,460
I'm bombing this class pretty hard

1543
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,460
and I start writing the most like

1544
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,460
fucked up essays possible

1545
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,460
right so at one point the teacher

1546
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,460
asks us to like

1547
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,460
take five quotes and like

1548
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,460
write an analysis of them

1549
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,460
so I choose

1550
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,460
and I don't know

1551
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,460
oh it's much better than that

1552
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,460
one of my five

1553
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,460
was the speech that Martin Luther King

1554
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,460
gives in the boondocks

1555
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,460
where he gives the whole

1556
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,460
all I see is fucking niggas

1557
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,460
would you ignorant niggas

1558
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,460
please shut the hell up

1559
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,460
shut the hell up

1560
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,460
I wrote out the whole speech

1561
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,460
in my essay with all the niggas

1562
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,460
intact

1563
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,460
I hope you just said

1564
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,460
an asterisk

1565
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,460
every single one

1566
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,460
the whole essay is just asterisk

1567
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,460
it wasn't very long

1568
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:30,460
we only had to write one page of analysis of each quote

1569
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,460
but I did that quote

1570
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,460
which the teacher

1571
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,460
not only gave me

1572
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,460
a shit grade for that

1573
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,460
but also wrote into the notes like

1574
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,460
Martin Luther King never said this

1575
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,460
which is you bitch

1576
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,460
because I said in the essay

1577
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,460
that it was a quote from a show

1578
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,460
so she didn't even read

1579
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
your fucking essay

1580
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,460
the epitome of fucking commenting

1581
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:56,460
before reading the entire video

1582
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,460
she was the first

1583
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,460
she was the first shitty commenter

1584
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:02,460
you ever had

1585
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,460
imagine in the board of directors

1586
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,460
when they're inventing education and someone says

1587
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,460
you have to have a test with grades

1588
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,460
someone would have been like wait hold on

1589
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,460
all the essays that they have to write

1590
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,460
that's subjective how can you grade that

1591
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,460
just get out

1592
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:18,460
we just gotta get this system over with

1593
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:20,460
we gotta get back to not dying

1594
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,460
I had it in my head because like one of the books we read

1595
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:24,460
early into this class

1596
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,460
had the word cunt

1597
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,460
and the word fuck in it

1598
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,460
so I kinda got it in my head like okay

1599
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,460
we're reading stuff with swears in it

1600
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,460
I can write those into my essays

1601
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:36,460
it's advanced

1602
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,460
we're all mature adults here

1603
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:40,460
I wrote some swearing

1604
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,460
I got into a lot of trouble

1605
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,460
the word niggas

1606
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,460
is like water and the school system

1607
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,460
is like the wicked witch of the west

1608
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,460
when you put one on the other

1609
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,460
the whole thing just collapses

1610
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,460
here's how I almost got expelled from school

1611
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,460
so I wrote an essay

1612
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,460
oh by the way your story is very American

1613
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,460
history X

1614
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,460
so this essay

1615
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,460
that I wrote was

1616
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,460
our teacher assigned us that we had to take

1617
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,460
one

1618
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,460
author

1619
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,460
who we had read in class

1620
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,460
and apply their style to a story

1621
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,460
about a time when we had failed

1622
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,460
and so I chose George Orwell

1623
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,460
and to apply it

1624
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,460
to me failing

1625
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,460
to do my English homework

1626
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,460
and I wrote this five page essay

1627
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,460
that was like this

1628
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,460
unbelievably depressing manifesto

1629
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,460
about how much I

1630
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,460
hated doing schoolwork

1631
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,460
it's like bouncing between

1632
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,460
it was

1633
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,460
I assume it was pretty good

1634
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:42,460
at this point I had gotten a handle

1635
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,460
on writing in this Gonzo style

1636
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,460
that I kind of do now

1637
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,460
so it read kind of like an S4 Diary video

1638
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:50,460
but it was bouncing between dialogue

1639
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,460
between me and Donsan

1640
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,460
and storytelling or narrating

1641
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,460
and so there's one part where I'm talking about

1642
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,460
how I'm

1643
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,460
holding a gun to my head

1644
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,460
and convincing myself not to pull the trigger

1645
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,460
to the deck down

1646
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:06,460
there's one part where I'm in the text

1647
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,460
because I was texting Donsan in part of the story

1648
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,460
and he says something like don't flip out

1649
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,460
and stab your teacher or something like that

1650
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,460
oh boy here we go

1651
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,460
just like how when you did those update videos

1652
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,460
with you with a gun they took that seriously

1653
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,460
and thought you were trying to kill yourself

1654
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,460
so your teachers really were shooting commentary

1655
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,460
is that the one where you shoot yourself in the head like eight times

1656
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,460
and it doesn't do anything

1657
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,460
that's the sort of online announcement

1658
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,460
so I wrote this essay

1659
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:32,460
I turned it in and like

1660
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,460
like she was like always

1661
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,460
grading this stuff like a month after we turned it in

1662
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,460
like she was it was like a really long cycle

1663
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,460
so it was a long time before I heard back about this

1664
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,460
but I happened to be like

1665
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,460
out of the house

1666
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,460
and I come walking home and my parents are like

1667
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,460
furious and terrified and like yelling at me

1668
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,460
like what the fuck did you do what did you write

1669
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:52,460
and I'm like confused as fuck because it's been a while

1670
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,460
since I wrote this thing so I'd forgotten about it

1671
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,460
and what the funny thing is

1672
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,460
like the motivation for writing it was

1673
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:00,460
I wanted to get out of this English class

1674
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,460
like it was a cry for help

1675
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,460
it was a cry for please get me out of here

1676
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,460
so I get into all this trouble

1677
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,460
and my dad's particularly freaking out

1678
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,460
because this is like maybe

1679
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,460
two months after the Virginia Tech Massacre

1680
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,460
so like

1681
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,460
the idea that they called my parents

1682
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,460
and are like your son wrote this essay

1683
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,460
where he mentioned stabbing teachers and shooting people

1684
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,460
and they're like that's how it was

1685
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,460
put to my parents

1686
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,460
because what had happened was

1687
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,460
this essay and she got scared

1688
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,460
and she came to my guidance counselor

1689
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,460
who as we've already established is an

1690
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,460
idiot and a bitch

1691
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,460
and she read the essay and she interpreted it

1692
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,460
way more dramatically

1693
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,460
and she thought it was like this

1694
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:42,460
you know this terrifying

1695
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,460
manifesto kind of thing

1696
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:46,460
so she's the one who called my parents and was like

1697
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,460
your son's writing about shooting teachers and stuff

1698
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,460
so I have to go in

1699
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,460
the next day to a meeting

1700
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,460
where it's like my assistant

1701
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,460
was like a disciple for my grade

1702
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,460
and the school psychologist did not know

1703
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,460
that was a thing

1704
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,460
but apparently there's a school psychologist

1705
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,460
who they bring in for moments like this

1706
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,460
and we sit in a meeting with them and my parents

1707
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,460
luckily they were both

1708
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,460
way more they were both cool

1709
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,460
they were understanding

1710
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,460
the psychologist liked the essay

1711
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,460
he was like you know I think

1712
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,460
he read it and he said I think you're gonna be a great writer someday

1713
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,460
so they

1714
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,460
they liked it and they were like alright

1715
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,460
take the rest of the day off and come in tomorrow

1716
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,460
and we'll discuss this right

1717
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,460
so the next day at the very end of the day

1718
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:30,460
like the bells ringing for everyone

1719
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,460
to go home and they like take me into this

1720
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,460
side meeting room that I didn't even know about

1721
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,460
and there's like all these teachers

1722
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,460
in there like the English teacher

1723
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,460
the assistant principal, the school psychologist

1724
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,460
and then like a bunch of people I don't even know

1725
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,460
are all like having a round table with me right

1726
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,460
and

1727
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,460
I didn't quite like understand what was

1728
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:50,460
happening at the time because I was a really shy

1729
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:52,460
offspoken kid and I didn't handle

1730
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,460
quick decision making well at all

1731
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:56,460
right? If you do, if you do at that age

1732
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,460
we're all on the spectrum

1733
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,460
what I eventually figured out was they were

1734
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,460
basically trying to get me

1735
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:04,460
to say I don't want to take this class anymore

1736
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,460
because

1737
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,460
why did they just fucking say that?

1738
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,460
they were saying like hey

1739
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,460
are you sure you want to take this class

1740
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,460
are you sure you don't want to stop because it seems like

1741
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:16,460
from this essay you don't want to take this class

1742
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,460
and I kind of got the sense that maybe the teacher

1743
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:20,460
is just afraid to have me in that class anymore

1744
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,460
yeah that's totally possible

1745
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,460
so moral of the story

1746
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,460
is eventually they talked me into dropping the class

1747
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,460
she's a feminist and she fears the

1748
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,460
of the manpower and dude it was so epic

1749
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,460
when this happened because I come walking out of this

1750
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,460
boardroom and like they had told my

1751
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,460
bus to just like wait for me

1752
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,460
so like I come out like

1753
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,460
all the other buses have left and I come

1754
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:42,460
walking out of the building and my bus is waiting

1755
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,460
there like by itself with all the kids on it

1756
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,460
and I just get out and I'm like

1757
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,460
I got everything I wanted

1758
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,460
like I became convinced I was God

1759
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,460
after this because

1760
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,460
I had finished to miss a day of

1761
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:56,460
school and stay home

1762
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,460
I got out of the English class I didn't want to be a part of

1763
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,460
no repercussions, no punishments

1764
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,460
we're looking at a

1765
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:04,460
light yagami level intellect over here

1766
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:06,460
it's fucking amazing what this guy can do

1767
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,460
like you can find on my anime

1768
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,460
blog where I wrote like a post that's like

1769
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,460
to the effect of I'm a fucking God

1770
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,460
I can't believe how great I am

1771
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:16,460
God of the new world did you bro

1772
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,460
um so I

1773
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,460
it's a death note reference people

1774
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,460
I got a shitty essay story

1775
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,460
it's gonna be quicker than yours

1776
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,460
I'll just wrap up my disillusion

1777
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,460
because like after that

1778
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,460
I ended up in a normal English class

1779
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,460
which I literally passed while sleeping

1780
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,460
through every class like it was on the level

1781
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,460
of idiocy that I could do

1782
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,460
I could not fail it like I couldn't

1783
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,460
possibly fail the class

1784
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,460
but from that point forward

1785
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,460
like this is what school is

1786
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,460
to me it's guidance counselors failing

1787
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,460
you and getting getting your fucking

1788
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,460
shit messed up it's teachers

1789
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,460
who are fucking don't understand

1790
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:54,460
you and don't have like I mean how could she possibly

1791
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,460
have just like figured out

1792
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,460
my problems when she had like four there were

1793
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,460
literally 40 kids in this class like per class

1794
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:02,460
and she was you know grading essays

1795
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,460
a month after they were written how the

1796
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,460
fuck is she supposed to deal with my hang ups

1797
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,460
you know like she can

1798
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,460
which is why they had to have school psychologists

1799
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,460
do it so like in my

1800
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,460
like I just became so

1801
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,460
like in the mindset of like wow

1802
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,460
school means nothing and like the 12th

1803
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,460
grade at my school they were so

1804
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,460
desperate to graduate kids that

1805
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:24,460
12th grade was just a skate

1806
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,460
like they would get like none of the classes would give

1807
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,460
homework everyone was trying to like

1808
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,460
baby the students

1809
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,460
that's pretty common my English teacher

1810
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,460
like he was supposed to assign

1811
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,460
like 1984 as the

1812
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:38,460
reading for that thing and he literally

1813
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,460
didn't give us a book because he was like you guys aren't

1814
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,460
going to read it and I don't want to fail all of you

1815
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,460
so he didn't give us the book

1816
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,460
so it was just such a walk in the park and I've

1817
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,460
had like you know just to summarize

1818
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,460
really quick like one of my friends Mike

1819
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,460
he this dude

1820
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,460
couldn't this dude had like

1821
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,460
29 credits

1822
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,460
but there was one class that he hadn't

1823
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,460
passed and he was like

1824
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,460
18 and you know full

1825
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,460
fully graduated

1826
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,460
except that he couldn't take this one class

1827
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,460
and they wouldn't let him take it because he couldn't

1828
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,460
take one class like they

1829
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,460
you can't just come back to school and take one

1830
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,460
class in high school why the fuck

1831
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:16,460
not I don't know but he had already

1832
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,460
done all the other classes

1833
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:20,460
he had 29 credits the maximum you need

1834
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,460
to graduate is 24

1835
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,460
he had 29 and he couldn't graduate

1836
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,460
they wouldn't let him go take the other class

1837
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,460
I'm so far over

1838
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,460
my graduation requirements for school in terms

1839
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,460
of numbers it's just the fucking specific

1840
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,460
piece of shit

1841
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,460
in my senior year

1842
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,460
of high school in English class

1843
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,460
by the way English was my best subject in high

1844
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,460
school definitely

1845
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:44,460
so and I was in

1846
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,460
like advanced English

1847
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:48,460
and we had like a big

1848
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,460
literary essay for the last

1849
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,460
semester of fucking 12th grade or whatever

1850
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,460
and or 11th it doesn't matter

1851
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,460
and we had to

1852
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,460
like we knew about it the entire semester it counted

1853
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,460
for like a third of our grade it was big

1854
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,460
and

1855
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:04,460
you know it was very strict about like

1856
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,460
notation like you have to

1857
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,460
you have to make a bibliography

1858
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,460
and notate it in the APA format

1859
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:12,460
I remember doing that yep

1860
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:14,460
you have to be very strict about that

1861
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,460
anyway the day finally

1862
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,460
comes when it's due I've been writing it for like weeks

1863
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:20,460
and I've got

1864
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,460
and I bring it to class and I realize

1865
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:24,460
like I look at my bibliography and I see

1866
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,460
you're supposed to have the

1867
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:28,460
titles underlined and the other things

1868
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,460
in quotations whatever anyway one of my things is not

1869
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,460
underlined properly it's

1870
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,460
underlined I tried

1871
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,460
I drew in an underline but it looked bad because

1872
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,460
I drew it on the pen and I was like shit

1873
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,460
this doesn't look quite right

1874
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,460
so I went to my friend

1875
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,460
who was in who had like a computer lab

1876
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,460
class and I was like hey

1877
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,460
would you mind doing me a favor

1878
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,460
could you just like reprint

1879
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,460
this one little page

1880
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,460
with the underline

1881
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,460
in place yeah like print this

1882
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,460
with an underline just so it's it's right

1883
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:00,460
when you're in the fucking computer lab and she was like

1884
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,460
share Ben I'll do this

1885
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,460
for you so later

1886
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,460
so later that day she hands me the

1887
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,460
retight version it's in a totally different font

1888
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:10,460
this time oh god

1889
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,460
whatever at least at least it's complete

1890
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,460
I hand it in I get

1891
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,460
the essay back like a week later with a big

1892
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,460
fucking zero on it

1893
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:20,460
because I had because

1894
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,460
because it was because she had forgotten

1895
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,460
one of my sources

1896
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,460
and because it was missing a source

1897
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:28,460
they gave me a zero for plagiarism

1898
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:30,460
of course

1899
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,460
oh my god

1900
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,460
I lost like an entire letter and my

1901
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,460
parents were furious they went to school

1902
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,460
and were like this is totally unfair

1903
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,460
this is a stupid that you would give a

1904
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,460
zero for this like typo

1905
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,460
is basically what it is but they were so

1906
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:46,460
fucking set on like they had

1907
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,460
like oh no we laid out the rules really

1908
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,460
clearly like we're really set on sticking

1909
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,460
to these fucking guidelines we've laid out

1910
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:54,460
so yeah I got a big zero

1911
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:56,460
like the biggest essay of the entire

1912
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,460
schooling

1913
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:00,460
every time I hear something like that I just want to

1914
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:02,460
go burn down a school

1915
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,460
yeah absolutely

1916
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,460
here's a different kind of story on that

1917
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,460
by the way I've only got 14 minutes left

1918
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,460
of disk space let's wrap this shit up

1919
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,460
listen to this I don't know why

1920
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,460
because I'm an idiot

1921
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,460
but listen to this

1922
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,460
my buddy John in college

1923
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,460
was taking astronomy

1924
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,460
yes astronomy

1925
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,460
one of the assignments they had to do

1926
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:26,460
he just did not give a fuck

1927
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,460
he had calculated that like it's such an easy class

1928
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,460
that like he had already gotten an A

1929
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:32,460
no matter what he did at this point

1930
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,460
the worst he could get was a B

1931
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,460
no matter if he got a zero for everything else

1932
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,460
so what he did for the final assignment

1933
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,460
was just like this big like summary of like

1934
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,460
it was kind of like just your thoughts and opinions

1935
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,460
on like what astronomy

1936
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,460
is about like what it's meant to you and stuff

1937
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,460
so what he did instead of actually writing

1938
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,460
this essay properly

1939
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,460
he wrote it a stream of consciousness

1940
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,460
like about his current feelings

1941
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,460
about astronomy

1942
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:58,460
while just like thinking about the night sky

1943
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:00,460
and so it's just this whole big thing

1944
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,460
is that what it was supposed to be about

1945
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,460
no well I mean not really

1946
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:06,460
it was supposed to have like sources

1947
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,460
and like we learned this this and this and like

1948
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:10,460
but he just interpreted it

1949
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,460
something like your what you've learned

1950
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,460
in the class but it's supposed to be like a fairly big

1951
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,460
like five page paper about you know

1952
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,460
substantive stuff

1953
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,460
but he just talked about like Mars

1954
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,460
Mars is red red makes me feel

1955
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,460
angry I look up at the sky and I see Mars

1956
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:26,460
I get I get so angry

1957
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,460
but then I look at Venus and I see Venus

1958
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,460
and I'm filled with hope and I'm filled with lust

1959
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,460
for a woman's body you know like

1960
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,460
this is what he wrote in the paper and like

1961
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,460
so he gets it back like a month later

1962
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,460
after he turns it in it just says

1963
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,460
on the paper F

1964
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,460
terrible and that's it

1965
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,460
and that's it

1966
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,460
that's kind of when to go John

1967
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:48,460
all of my essays in high school were always

1968
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,460
like stream of conscious meditatives

1969
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,460
like they all were terrible

1970
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,460
just the one word

1971
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:56,460
and did he just did he just shrug and go like

1972
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,460
yeah yes so

1973
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,460
yeah that's exactly how he implied it

1974
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:02,460
to me

1975
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,460
another thing that happened like when I was

1976
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,460
in 12th grade we had

1977
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:08,460
like a government class I think it was

1978
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,460
and like

1979
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:12,460
these

1980
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,460
we had this new teacher who like

1981
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,460
she had just come from like another school and she

1982
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,460
transferred in and like

1983
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,460
half the time in class

1984
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,460
she would just like not be able to

1985
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:24,460
explain the subject matter to the students

1986
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,460
in a way that they could understand

1987
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,460
because she was like super by the book

1988
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:30,460
but she always seemed like really nervous and stuff

1989
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,460
like and so I would often

1990
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,460
like there was one time she was trying to explain

1991
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:36,460
affirmative action and

1992
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,460
oh boy oh boy here comes the white

1993
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,460
trying to do this like yeah she

1994
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:42,460
wouldn't like use like

1995
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,460
words white or black and stuff

1996
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,460
really trying to like tiptoe

1997
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:48,460
around the issue

1998
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,460
she was white I assume she was

1999
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,460
was white okay about half the class

2000
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,460
was black so yeah

2001
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,460
like I could tell

2002
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,460
everyone in the class seemed interested

2003
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:00,460
and like they wanted to understand

2004
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,460
but she just could not explain it because she

2005
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:04,460
was walking so hard on eggshells

2006
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,460
and finally I did this

2007
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:08,460
like a lot of times during this class

2008
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,460
I would just say yo niggas let me tell you

2009
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:12,460
I literally said to the teacher

2010
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:14,460
can I explain this

2011
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,460
and she was like did you stood up with his arms

2012
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,460
crossed with his backwards hat and his big

2013
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,460
and his big and his big flavorflave

2014
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,460
chain and said yo let me break it down

2015
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:24,460
for you I would say can I explain this

2016
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,460
and she'd say yes and I was just like

2017
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:28,460
if you have

2018
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:30,460
10 white guys and 5 black guys

2019
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:32,460
in the community that's how many you have to hire

2020
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:34,460
you're like it's that simple

2021
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,460
you know and everyone got it

2022
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,460
you know and but it's just

2023
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:40,460
that like she was so by the

2024
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,460
book about everything and it's funny too because

2025
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,460
I didn't do well in this class because I would goof

2026
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,460
off the whole time like me and that kid

2027
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,460
Mike I mentioned sat next to each other

2028
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,460
and we were just fucking talk and pass

2029
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,460
notes and be assholes and so like

2030
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:54,460
even though I knew the subject

2031
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:56,460
well enough that I was

2032
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,460
teaching parts of the class better

2033
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,460
than the teacher could I nonetheless

2034
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:02,460
because she was very

2035
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,460
strictly by the book and I was completely

2036
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,460
not following the book

2037
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,460
didn't do well in this class but I just

2038
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,460
to me all of this just says like all I see

2039
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,460
is a joke when I look at the school system

2040
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,460
all I see is all these cracks

2041
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,460
like people fall through the cracks and there's cracks

2042
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,460
everywhere it's all cracks

2043
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,460
it's just a joke

2044
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,460
you say it's a joke I say it's a big

2045
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,460
old fucking circus that's how I feel about it

2046
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:26,460
like when I'm

2047
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,460
tutoring someone I'm just like

2048
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,460
this is a joke like you don't need me

2049
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,460
you don't need me to tell you this stuff

2050
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:34,460
you could look it up on your own but you just don't

2051
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:36,460
for some thank you because I'm being paid for

2052
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,460
this I appreciate it but why

2053
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,460
why are you going on and on and on and on

2054
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,460
about all these problems what are some solutions

2055
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:44,460
everyone here's my

2056
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:46,460
here's my solution

2057
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,460
we will start

2058
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,460
the TPC institution it'll be the easiest

2059
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,460
school ever right you go

2060
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,460
you go to your decent human behavior

2061
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:56,460
class and it's just Jesse being

2062
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,460
don't stop being a fucking faggot

2063
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,460
you go to your economics class

2064
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:02,460
you go to your economics class and it's just

2065
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,460
all standing there in a circle going get money

2066
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,460
get money

2067
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,460
get money get money

2068
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:10,460
and you're in a school in like 45 minutes

2069
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,460
and you've learned everything you need to know

2070
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,460
that's the best fucking thing I've ever heard to do

2071
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,460
other than that my solution would be

2072
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,460
I think

2073
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:20,460
I think we take elementary

2074
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:22,460
and middle school maybe add one more year

2075
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:24,460
under middle school and

2076
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:26,460
turn it into teaching

2077
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,460
way more life skills way less bullshit

2078
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:30,460
I can't tell you how many times

2079
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,460
I relearned US history throughout school

2080
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:34,460
I don't care none of it mattered

2081
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:36,460
like I learned the same

2082
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:38,460
10 names about American history

2083
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,460
in every single year of education

2084
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,460
cut that shit out learn it once

2085
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,460
and then it's over because if I ever need the knowledge

2086
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,460
I'll look it up on the fucking computer

2087
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,460
so cut out

2088
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:50,460
majority of history can be cut out

2089
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,460
and you don't even learn the good stuff for example

2090
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,460
there was a civil war general named Hooker

2091
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:56,460
where that name came from because he had all these women in his tent

2092
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,460
never learned that in school

2093
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,460
so yeah cut out most of the history shit

2094
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,460
if you have a kid

2095
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,460
who's not doing good

2096
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:06,460
at math and you really try

2097
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,460
but it seems like he's not making it

2098
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,460
put him in something else

2099
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,460
take him out and by the way also in the civil war

2100
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,460
general Burnside had the largest

2101
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,460
sideburns of all time and that's where the term sideburns come from

2102
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,460
so you see the civil war has a huge

2103
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:20,460
wealth of knowledge

2104
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,460
with all of the money

2105
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,460
that we've saved by cutting

2106
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,460
three entire years off of the education system

2107
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,460
and

2108
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,460
and just burning down lots of schools

2109
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:32,460
because

2110
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,460
like

2111
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:36,460
now that we've saved all this money

2112
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:38,460
let's put it into

2113
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,460
making way more trade

2114
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,460
schools and way more schools where

2115
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:44,460
after the

2116
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,460
ninth grade, ninth grade is the last grade we have

2117
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,460
in my new school system

2118
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,460
you have nine grades, they're way more specialized

2119
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,460
we put in

2120
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,460
there's lots of different types of courses

2121
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,460
it seems like he doesn't know anything about math

2122
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:58,460
put him in an arts course

2123
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,460
if he doesn't know anything about arts

2124
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:02,460
put him in a math course, find somewhere

2125
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,460
have different course loads for different people

2126
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,460
way more so than we currently have

2127
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:08,460
get rid of the fucking common core

2128
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,460
nobody needs history this fucking badly

2129
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,460
put him in something else

2130
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,460
cut a bunch of bullshit out, restructure it

2131
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,460
then after ninth grade

2132
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,460
have three years of trade school

2133
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,460
they can pick whichever one they want to go to

2134
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,460
because even if they don't get a job in that field

2135
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,460
it doesn't matter because just like college

2136
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,460
you'll pick up a bunch of life skills

2137
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,460
if you learn how to

2138
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:30,460
become, let's say

2139
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,460
a computer programmer those skills

2140
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,460
will help you forever in

2141
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:36,460

2144
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,460

to understand and learn

2150
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,460
what code is and then learn how to code

2151
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:56,460
and code everything forever because

2152
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,460

what the hell is wrong with me

2169
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,460
funny I'm

2170
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,460
supposed to be creating

2171
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:24,460
funny

2172
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:26,460
think that the people

2173
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:28,460
gladly

2174
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:30,460
will pay for

2175
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,460
artistic genius

2176
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:34,460
that's what they came for

2177
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,460
instead

2178
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:38,460
I'm tweeting

2179
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,460
hashtag repeating

2180
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:42,460
that's why there's no

2181
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,460
weed and holes in

2182
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,460
the ceiling

2183
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:48,460
yeah

2184
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,460
it's quite the burden

2185
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,460
it's a hard knock life

2186
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:54,460
being

2187
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,460
a genius
