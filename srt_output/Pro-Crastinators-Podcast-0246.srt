00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's just me. It's

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,680
just me again. Just Ben Saint, your host. Except, I've also got a guest today, Minerva

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,720
from Eldina Doublecast. Is that right?

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Eldina.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,720
Eldina.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Eldina.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,320
It is I, Minerva P. Kelly, and today the P stands for Pro Crastinators. You can find

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,720
me on both Twitter and Tumblr at Doublecast, spelled with a 5 instead of an S. I have an

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,240
award-winning YouTube channel where I make bad content that gives you brain damage and

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,000
only makes sense if you read too much fan fiction.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Eldina.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,480
It's true. It's true. I know. I know that it's true. I know you. I know. I'm going to admit

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,200
I haven't watched most of your videos, but I have, but I have seen the, I have seen and

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,880
would highly recommend it's the three videos, the when, when posting goes wrong, or maybe

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,200
they're not all when posting goes wrong, the one about the witch with the bones, the one

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,360
about the Hamilton with HIV, and the one about miscribed Harry Potter.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,640
Everyone, everyone listening who has not seen this series or doesn't know about these dramas

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,720
is incredibly confused right now, but yes, those are the videos. Those are all when posting

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,680
goes wrong. Also, forgot to say this earlier. Pronouns, she, her, get it right.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
True.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,560
Ben was nice enough to invite an early transition trans woman on his podcast, so please watch.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Well, we have like, well, we have like five of those in our fucking, in our ranks now.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Beautiful.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Yeah, this is just, this is just par for the course. We used to be, we used to be a boys

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,360
club. We used to be a real sausage, sausage party here at the PCP, but it's all, it's

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,800
all got flip turned upside down now. It's all fucked up.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,560
That's a, that's what it's, it's what Biden getting elected did. It's like buying it selected

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,080
and then you hear like the FBI knock on your door, they burst in, put on the cat ears.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
And then they, and they erased the memories that don't even know. They don't know that's

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,320
what did it. That's what happened.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,360
Never, never realized it was the coronavirus vaccine. I don't know.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,360
It's five G. There's like five different angles we can take with this joke. I think the unironic

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,440
like non joke answer is that being inside all day and not being able to like, not having

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,520
to be out in society forces you to like do more self reflection and like turn inward.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,440
And that like, I think that it like accelerates the process where it's like, if just like

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
more time for reflection, yeah, it's like, if coming out as trans for someone who's like

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,920
just starting to question their gender would normally take like three to five years, I

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,560
feel like you can do it in like six months if you can't go outside because it's just

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
all you can think about.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
It's, it's, it's, I mean, I've definitely noticed the, a sudden, you know, just like

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,040
the price of Bitcoin suddenly this year, the rate of transitioning just, just skyrocketed.

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh God, I want to, I should, last episode I was talking about my Bitcoin adventures.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh God.

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I don't have much to say about that because I've, it's come to

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,120
an end. It came to a sad and ignominious end. I, the, the, the, the long and short of it

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,000
of my, of my, of my Bitcoin speculation was I invested way too much. I invested like way

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,840
too much of my personal savings in it. And then, and this was as it was like going up

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,960
and I'm watching it go up and I'm like, yes, yes, I'm fucking rich. I'm fucking rich. And

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,680
then it immediately, but I'm spending like 24 hours a day just staring at the fucking

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,720
ticker, just watching the lines go up and down. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm ready. If

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
it starts to go down, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sell. I'm gonna sell. Of course that's not

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,880
what happened. It started, it started to plummet. It started to plummet and I have weak hands.

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
So once it went down, once it went down far enough, I'm like, it's too scary. I can't

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,480
do it. I can't do it anymore. I sold it all. I ended up, I would, for a minute there, I

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:42,000
had made like $1,000, but when I sold, I had lost like 200. So, you know, it's fine.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
It's fine. It's all, you know, easy come, easy go.

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,640
That's a, I mean, Bitcoin has always just been a casino. So that's pretty par for the

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,360
course I feel like. True. I mean, yeah.

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,120
I remember back in like 2012, when Bitcoin was first getting started, or maybe it was

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
like a little earlier, but that's when it came to my attention. I tried buying Bitcoin

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,720
or like setting up like a Bitcoin mine because it's. Imagine buying Bitcoin in 2012. Yeah.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
That's the thing. It's like, I couldn't, because here's the thing, despite like making, I wouldn't

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,600
call it a career because I'm not like, this isn't my job. It's like a hobby that pays

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,560
well for some reason. But like despite, you know, doing all this stuff online, I'm not

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,160
actually tech savvy. Like I don't really understand how most of the stuff works. So I could not

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,560
get the Bitcoin mine up and running. Oh God, you were trying to mine it? Or I don't know.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Well, I didn't know like how to, it was, I couldn't figure out either a, how to buy it

68
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,960
because I was in like high school. So I didn't have like enough disposable income to just

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,520
go around buying Bitcoin. So I was like, what if I, but I heard like the way that you get

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,840
Bitcoins is you like generate them with like the algorithms or whatever. I was like, I wonder

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:05,160
if I can like set that up on my, you know, 2010 MacBook, which I think even if I had figured

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,000
out how to do it, it probably wouldn't have worked. But man, it's thinking back like, I

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,280
would be a very, very rich woman right now. I bought Bitcoin in 2012.

74
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,440
I mean, I don't really, I have no idea how one would mine for it. I haven't even looked

75
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,720
into it. I know I don't have what it takes to do that shit. In fact, I made a huge fool

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,480
of myself last episode trying to explain what I thought Bitcoin was. And I said at the time,

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm probably completely wrong. Turns out, yes, I was completely wrong about like what a Bitcoin is.

78
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:50,040
A Twitter user actually underscore Dio, helpfully called me an idiot and sent me a DM. Got called

79
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,880
by Dio himself with a link to a video explaining more or less what Bitcoin is. So now I understand

80
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,720
it a lot better. The only reason I was able to buy it is just because like this like like two months

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,760
ago PayPal just rolled out a feature where you can just you can just buy it on PayPal. You can

82
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,920
just invest through PayPal. That's the only reason why I couldn't do it in the first place. It's

83
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,240
because it's because they made it. It's because they made it so convenient, even a fucking ignoramus

84
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,320
like myself could ruin could ruin their life watching the fucking ticker going up and down 24

85
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,560
hours a day. It was the worst thing. The worst thing about it is that I'm not even free. I'm not

86
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,840
even free just because I sold because now I watch it and obsess over it and look at like, oh, how

87
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,840
much could I have made? Oh, how much would I have lost? I sold it all, but it's still inside me.

88
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,720
You need to do like a clean break. You need to just go cold turkey off Bitcoin. You can't let

89
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,680
this dominate your life anymore. You're right. You're right. I can't I can't let it keep gaslighting

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,800
me. I gotta say I'm kind of glad that like I am not more drawn to like Wall Street bets and like

91
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,040
crypto investing and shit like that because like I am like infamously bad at making bets.

92
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,200
Um, my audience has been repeatedly mocking me lately because in basically

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,760
from the period of time after Bernie Sanders lost the primary up until like October,

94
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,680
I was making a long series of bets formatted as if Joe Biden actually wins the election this

95
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,080
November, I will blank. And it was always something really like embarrassing and ridiculous.

96
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,440
It seemed like a long shot for a while. It seemed incredibly unlikely. So here's what I ended up with

97
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,760
after my blind, unflinching confidence in democratic incompetence.

98
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,200
If Biden wins by the most expensive dildo on baddragon.com and display it prominently in

99
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:08,040
my home, subsist entirely off jack in the box tacos for a week, eat a whole lemon like an apple,

100
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,040
live stream myself cooking and then eating a tortilla filled with goldfish and Totino's pizza

101
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:25,240
rolls, get into get into Bandori. Uh, what I don't know what that is. It's a it's a anime like it's

102
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,280
it's like a it's like a gotcha game. It's one of those. It's the one one of the ones with like a

103
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,240
lot of girls by by a mug that says, don't talk to me until I've come in my wife and then film

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,200
myself drinking Mountain Dew gamer fuel out of it. Stick a bunch of Reese's minis on a slice of

105
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,840
cheese pizza and eat it. It goes on like this for a while. These are these are just like honestly

106
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,080
the only one of those that I think is that bad is the is the by the expensive dildo one because

107
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,600
I gotta imagine the most expensive one on bad dragon is like in the four digits. It's definitely

108
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:10,440
a few hundred. I haven't done the full map the way that it I was kind of uh uh what was I trying

109
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,400
to say I didn't quite understand how it worked because it's they don't have like oh hello someone

110
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,520
else just joined. Oh who's who's that? Who just joined? Hello. Gib. Hey. Hey Gib. Hi. Hello. Hey.

111
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,760
Welcome to the podcast. Hey. Well we're doing a surprise. We have two hosts now.

112
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:39,000
Yay. Woo. Ah it's a real podcast. No it can't be true. It's true. It's sad but true. I just wondered

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,040
in here. Don't don't give me that host job. Don't give me that that lady. Hey whoa introduce yourself.

114
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,800
Hello everyone. I'm Gib and take. I make art. She made it. Congratulations.

115
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,520
I don't know if you watched any of Minerva's videos that I told everyone to watch because

116
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,240
I like them a lot. I had a I had a five second like what a clicked link and I saw Pokemon

117
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,120
let's plays. I was like oh cool. I didn't have time. Oh my god you watched the let's play.

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh I clicked I clicked on it for a few seconds. I was like okay cool it's Pokemon. I was about to

119
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,160
be very impressed because that's my LD. Elden a double cast famous a poke tuber just like just like

120
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,560
me. I well I was about to say I would have been uh hilariously surprised if you had watched the

121
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,760
Pokemon let's plays because that's my least popular content. It was just the first thing I saw.

122
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah I got you. Um where were we? Where were we? We were talking about Joe Biden.

123
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,280
Right let's let's get back to it. I made a bunch of basically that was a very long tangent I probably

124
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,520
didn't need to go on but the the short version of this is I'm glad I don't bet like actual money

125
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,160
because I would have lost a lot of money on the election. Right right um

126
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,000
you know what why are we talking about politics? Ah you know the pro cre- ah pee this podcast

127
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,640
gone too political lately. Well speaking of politics out of my podcast. Thank you thank you.

128
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,480
Out of you. You gotta keep me in line. Um speaking of speaking of uh gambling or whatever the fuck

129
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,040
betting betting on things. Nice nice. Uh my bit my bitcoin update I've lost six pennies. Fuck you.

130
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,720
Six pennies have gone down. Good good good. Since I invested it's gone up and down um I've like the

131
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:51,240
maximum like I invested one whole pound British sterling pound uh to the bitcoin craze so I'm

132
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,360
cashing in when it gets when it gets big I'm just waiting just waiting it out. It's just kind of

133
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,840
it's just kind of been wobbling like it peaked and then it dropped and then I got scared and I

134
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,360
sold and since then it's just kind of been wobbling like up and down around where I sold it at so

135
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,840
you know who knows who knows what could happen you know they say the market's bullish they say

136
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,360
the they say we're nowhere near the market cap so you know just keep holding on to it it'll go up

137
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,000
eventually just just keep holding just keep holding either it goes to absolute zero like zero of my

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,400
investment is is remained and then I will invest again because that means it's gone down or I'll

139
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:37,320
become the new Elon Musk you know. Yeah Christ true really the greatest accomplishment anyone

140
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:46,200
can have is being the new Elon Musk. He was on the Simpsons. No that can't be that's not that's not

141
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,120
possible. No you know the way it's true it's it's true and Lisa Lisa calls him like the

142
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,000
most important living inventor. Jesus Christ. That's how you know that's how you know Simpsons

143
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,760
is fucking over that's how you know it should have ended a long time ago that's the moment. The

144
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,960
nature of the Simpsons is that okay the Simpsons is kind of like supernatural for me and that you

145
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:13,640
can tell me literally anything happened on it I'll be like sure all right. Well sure because I mean

146
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,080
it's it's had like 40 40 thousand episodes. Yeah exactly. It's just like eventually they

147
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:27,160
exhaust all possible ideas. There is there is a clip or a series of images from the Simpsons

148
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,360
to express any idea that a human can conceive and hold in their mind. I saw one I saw one

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,640
one of the guys uh one of the two guys who host Anamorph in Time the leftist Anamorph's

150
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:49,400
podcast which I have been which I have been I have been binging this week posted a reaction

151
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,320
get to some shit about the like coronavirus vaccine you know like rising cases in the United

152
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,640
States and it was the scene it was the scene when Homer owns the bowling alley of when first he's

153
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,320
reading like advanced like business and then he goes down to basic like business guide and then

154
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,280
he finally just goes down to just like staring at a bowling ball and it was that with epidemiology.

155
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,600
Oh my god. And I was like the Simpsons is the truly the greatest the greatest cultural monument

156
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,640
that humanity has yet has ever erected or ever will erect. It's like there's there's a Simpsons

157
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,520
reference for everything and there's a SpongeBob reference for everything. I who who do you think

158
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,480
okay who who wins in a fight uh Homer Simpson or SpongeBob they're both yellow so that doesn't

159
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,840
give either of them an advantage. I feel like SpongeBob has more powers of like cartoon invincibility

160
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,640
like you can you can do basically anything to SpongeBob and he'll be basically okay where I

161
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:01,320
feel like Homer still obeys like some of the laws of like actual human anatomy and that if like

162
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,640
you kill you do something to him that would kill a normal person it would actually kill him.

163
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,280
That's true. Yeah it's just SpongeBob's harder to kill but he's so weak and he's also tiny.

164
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,000
He's weak and tiny. That's a good point oh right because in the the what is it in like the movie

165
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,040
when he's riding on David Hasselhoff yeah he's like really oh because he's the size of like an actual

166
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,440
sea sponge. He's the size of an yeah or not he's the size of like a table like a sink sponge.

167
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,960
All right because he he's he's a sea sponge but that just means he's a kitchen sponge that

168
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,000
lives in the sea. That lives in the sea yes exactly. It's self hilarious. I was thinking like if there's

169
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,920
like character archetypes you can match with the Simpsons and SpongeBob I'm sure there are but like

170
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,000
my first thought was like oh Homer would be Patrick though but then also SpongeBob I think he would

171
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,360
be both I think SpongeBob and Patrick combined would be Homer. He kind of is the shape of

172
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:05,560
Patrick but the color of SpongeBob. He combines both of their best qualities. Yes it's like it's like

173
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:14,680
main character like plot driving instincts from SpongeBob with the sort of raw like unfiltered

174
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,560
dumbassery of Patrick. Dude dude Squidward versus Moe. Squidward versus Moe. Oh god.

175
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh well I mean is it a physical battle or is it a clarinet playing contest? That determines

176
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,680
everything. I mean Moe has a gun. Moe has a fucking gun. He would literally just blow

177
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,680
no no no no Squidward could like leap like splash out of the water and like like face crab attack

178
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:51,160
Moe and he'd be like ah I can't see. The most fucked up thing about SpongeBob is that Squidward

179
00:17:51,160 --> 00:18:00,440
is an octopus. He's not a squid. That is but he's only got six legs. Does he? Because yeah he's got

180
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,280
his four he's got his four like leg legs and his two arm tentacles. I'm pretty sure every time

181
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,440
they do like a thing where they're out of the water and they show them as actual animals. Squidward

182
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,960
is an octopus not a squid. Also I believe that because they have actual squids in the show and

183
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,320
they have the pointy heads and his head is round like an octopus. Like he doesn't have the right

184
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,240
number of legs but I am like pretty sure this is a real thing and it's really fucked up. When he

185
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,200
when he moves to that like gated community with only other with all the other Squidward's yes

186
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,600
does it say that like there's their octopuses octopi or does it even like specify I mean it might not

187
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,720
even like say what they are it's just like assume that like yes these people are all just like him

188
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,880
whatever that means yeah I don't think they ever might be how they do it I don't think they ever

189
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,840
explain that we're just supposed to like infer uh everything about that location oh hang on

190
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,720
Steven Hillenberg designed Squidward with six arms because of convenience for simpler

191
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,840
animations Squidward was designed to have a large bulbous head like an octopus the creator

192
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,000
liked the way the creator liked the way the bulbous head on Squidward signified him as a

193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,640
grumpy next door neighbor blah blah blah however due to the inconvenience of the original name

194
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,840
octoword the original name was octoword the name Squidward was used instead just because it sounded

195
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:33,480
better basically um that's a octoword isn't octoword yeah yeah yeah high five

196
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,320
ow well now we know uh you high five yourself and hurt yourself we've learned yeah I did

197
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,960
yeah I did it's exactly what happened pro gamer move get Gibb did you see did you see what uh did

198
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,680
you see what Christine Weston Chandler tweeted today I would never go to twitter.com oh Jesus Christ

199
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,520
she she retweeted the picture of your your picture of the slime coin with diamond tiara

200
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,680
and she she did and then she and she's said some stuff about coins and then she

201
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,920
and then she literally plugged my comic oh yeah you guys have like talked to her before right

202
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,640

203
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,280
episode I hope I'm not repeating myself I don't think so I always get confused okay well she messaged

204
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,640
me like earlier this week or last week with just a picture of like a cool crystal that she bought

205
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:45,560
on some crystal website and said like hey look it's just like in Arizona uh uh you know and I

206
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,520
said ha it looks it looks just like the powder and that Christine turned blue and that gave

207
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,200
alternate timeline phantom horn his phantom his titular phantom horn and she said ha ha yes that's

208
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,960
correct and then she today she tweeted a picture of that crystal and then a bunch of like stuff about

209
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,040
slime and punishment and a link to my uh tapas page which I just this is what I thought was really

210
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,480
funny and then of course and then of course 50 people responded with like uh you know like uh uh

211
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,680
some pictures of like uh chris you're a fucking piece of shit and these are these are embarrassing

whole christorian thing and like all the people who like obsess over her in like the like stalkery

216
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,080
way that has to have too much in yeah there's a definitely a group of people who are far too

217
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,840
invested in the life and times of some stranger on the internet that happens to have written so much

218
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:11,320
you exactly like I uh christine is like one of those people where it's like because my series

219
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,520
that's like popular now in my youtube channel is when posting goes wrong which is about times when

220
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:26,520
people made posts that went wrong and like on one hand sonichu is like the perfect example of this

221
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,160
because it really was just someone posting some shit that got way out of hand and escalated to

222
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,880
like this insane internet phenomenon but on the other hand I so don't want to make a fucking video

223
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:48,520
about christian like there's already so many of them yeah a lot of them including yours are really

235
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,360

236
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:08,840

238
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:28,680
yeah it was only a dream though oh okay well uh uh sorry I interrupted your oh no it's fine I was

239
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,400
just gonna say like that's like one half of his there's already too many videos about chris chan

240
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:40,280
and the other thing is that like um I heard a quote once from I think it was the down the rabbit hole

241
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,840
guy uh fred frederick frederick nudesan yeah frederick nudesan where he's who I was on a stream

242
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,680
with one time that does not exist anywhere on the internet anymore because it was deleted mysterious

243
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,520
um bummer but he said something to the effect of once you make a video about chris chan that

244
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:08,520
does well that's all people will talk to you about ever and yeah I would prefer that not to be my fate

245
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,080
um it yeah I mean it doesn't necessarily I think that's somewhat in my experience that gets you

246
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,440
big and noticed in the first place um maybe but I mean I mean I mean more I mean more people know

247
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,760
me from the the sonichu lecture than from anything else that's true but it's not like I'm inundated

248
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,520
with like it's not like I'm inundated with with people wanting to talk to me about it all the time

249
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:44,440
it doesn't it's not like annoying I don't find it that annoying uh I mean some I don't know maybe

250
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,840
sometimes someone will when I when someone knows me and I like I find that it's from that I'm usually

251
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,040
like oh that's fine I don't know I guess I would there are other things I would like think it was

252
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,200
cooler if people knew me for than that but like it's not a problem it's not a problem that people

253
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,520
know me from that that's my two cents on the on the subject I got you uh I don't know um

254
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,400
I don't know uh uh I just I just thought it was neat I just thought it was neat that uh she was

255
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:20,040
that she just felt like tweeting about my fucking uh uh slime comic and stuff today I think that's

256
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:27,800
fucking neat oh yeah I've seen the the the retweet of my diamond tiara slime corp slime coin pick

257
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,200
I really like that photo it's strange I mean I know she follows me but she very rarely interacts

258
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:46,760
with anything I post mm-hmm wait I will post I will post the picture in the in the chat uh because uh

259
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:55,160
because uh there it is bam oh it's loading sorry my internet's bad that's fine it's fine okay there

260
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:11,720

261
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,040
familiar with homestuck you ever heard of a homestuck oh christ you ever heard about this wacky

262
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,440
thing on the internet call homestuck it's kind of like undertale but better oh unfortunately

263
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,360
fuck you I don't I don't I don't I don't know I don't know what your problem is uh me me and Gibber

264
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,920
unironic homestuck uh uh uh stands home stand from from way back oh wow homestands are you are you uh

265
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,920
are you uh I don't know what are you I'm more of a spatula myself what's your what's your relationship

266
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:55,480
with homestuck um Minerva my situation was that I had a bunch of friends who were really into it

267
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:04,520
when it was first getting big and I like purposely avoided it because it seemed it was like I think

268
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:12,200
the length of it intimidated me but also yeah I it just didn't speak to me in that way where it

269
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:21,080
would justify me reading through that much and then years later I started my uh main series

270
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,920
what your favorite ship says about you and at some point I was like well I have to do a

271
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,960
homestuck video eventually because everyone kept joking like oh if you did a homestuck video it'd

272
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,760
be like an hour you can't do a home like that would be insane and so I was like well that's a

273
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:45,160
challenge um I ended up reading about half of homestuck I got about halfway through it before

274
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:51,640
I got sick of it and couldn't read anymore which when you say half do you know the actual whole

275
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,840
length of the thing do you know where the halfway point is yeah I oh god what how many acts are

276
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:06,200
there again there's six but the sixth one is so big technically seven seven is just a video

277
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,160
I think if you read to the end of act five I would say you you did it correctly yeah I think I got

278
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,160
a little bit into act six is where I end up okay that honestly honestly good place to quit I

279
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:27,000
specifically remember the point where I quit was uh what fucking character was it is Dirk the second

280
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,760
one Dirk is the the alt brother of Dave Dirk's autoresponder I couldn't stand the autoresponder

281
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,840
I was just like every time this thing shows up it wastes like a huge amount of my time and says

282
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,200
nothing I'm so like more so than car cat like I've had enough I felt that way I just felt that way

283
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,880
about a lot of stuff in act six Jen I felt that way about like most characters in in act six even

284
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:03,080
the ones that had been good before um yeah I like I don't I never like had any confirmation one

285
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,560
where the other but it always felt like act six was hussy like getting bored of the story he was

286
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,440
telling and wanting to tell a completely different story but still needing to finish home stuck so

287
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,000
he's changed focus a little bit made it much more about these new characters with their teen drama

288
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,440
and less about the adventure that had been happening up to that point and then he just

289
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:34,600
sort of finished it with a big fight scene okay but I bring it up because I found I saw posted

290
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,320
maybe on twitter or somewhere this thing this this blog post you remember the whole thing about how

291
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,160
they crowdfunded hiveswap and then they gave it to that development studio and the development studio

292
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,560
basically like took the money and ran and made some other thing oh yeah I remember hearing about this

293
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,320
I think that was only ever a rumor I don't think it was ever like

294
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,720
completely confirmed but I'm I feel like it's like it seems like it would be the case

295
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,400
but well that seemed to be the narrative and that's what I had thought happened this whole time

296
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,440
I don't know I came upon this blog post saying that like no actually it was hussy actually it was

297
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:21,400
hussy that like fucked them over in various ways and I didn't actually I admit I didn't actually

298
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:28,120
read through this whole thing because it's really long but um I don't know it made me I I hope it's

299
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:36,920
not true I hope that uh I hope that hussy is a good boy but uh I don't know maybe he's I mean it

300
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,840
wouldn't it wouldn't like be like shocking to hear that he's bad at managing things based on

301
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,520
like even after the the whole odd gentleman thing and like the creation of what pumpkin studios

302
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:57,080
or whatever it was called hiveswap still took a billion years and yeah I don't know there's a

303
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,520
lot of little things maybe hussy isn't that good at organizing a business maybe he's better just

304
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,800
making little comics and when it blew up the way the homestuck did he was like shit I don't

305
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,240
fucking know what I'm doing maybe he's still like that I don't know I would perhaps I would not at

306
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,080
all be surprised if hussy was kind of an asshole just based off of like how he came across in the

307
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,360
comic I kind of got the sense that he was like he was self aware about having a big ego but not

308
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,360
enough to actually do anything about it um which is not a great combination

309
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:42,280
yeah I can kind of I can kind of see that oh no it's impossible anyone that makes a thing that I

310
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,080
like must be only good uh but what if but what if when I'm making a big comic and I want to be

311
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,680
best friends with Andrew hussy and he says uh fuck you that sucks I don't want that it can't

312
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,680
happen no it can't be it will never happen hey hussy would never screw me over like he

313
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,680
screwed the odd gentleman allegedly he's good still don't know you're right I'll have to read this

314
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:13,960
it's it seems like it seems like the the major allegation here is that like hussy like paid them

315
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,760
the money and then like and instead of having them make the game they were supposed to make he told

316
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,960
them like do stuff for the act seven finale instead and then basically tried to tell them like okay

317
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,880
now that you've done that like like do the game as well seemed like he was maybe trying to like

318
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,440
double dip with his money on them or something that's sounds like what they're saying was wrong

319
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,200
and why like the project fell through and they didn't complete it for him that's how it seems I

320
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,680
don't know it's it's really long and I'm sure there's more here uh I don't know I thought that was

321
00:33:52,680 --> 00:34:00,280
interesting and a little troubling uh because uh I haven't even played hiveswab have you played

322
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,440
hiveswab give yeah I did I did a review of it back when I was still doing those and I said in the

323
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,560
review I would eventually play the second one when it came out and have you played have you

324
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,440
played the second one is the second one out it's out now it's been so long that my of my

325
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:26,680
review channel career crumbled and I gave up in that time span well um owned indeed uh I don't

326
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,480
know the owned by the time the first one was like it had a few nice references and it was

327
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,800
decent uh looking and playing uh like point and click game but it didn't it wasn't like amazing

328
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,120
it was just sort of like oh yeah cool like kick started point and click adventure

329
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,960
somewhat interesting puzzles but yeah it was all right yeah the the best thing I could say about

330
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,520
it was that it could get more people interested in homestuck which is a better thing which is what

331
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,720
I ended up saying which would similarly the best thing about homestuck is that it can get people

332
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:10,840
to read problem sleuth which is a better thing valid no um no I would say I would say it's very

333
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:18,040
very good like more more consistently good and and easier to get through I'm I'm I joke I joke a

334
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,880
little bit I think it I think it's in some ways it's better uh but uh in in exploring all of the

335
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,640
little ideas that it comes up with and um neatly wrapping everything up at the end with a really

336
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,440
cool set of of events that like everything leads up to that point even though it seems to be going

337
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,240
in random directions the entire time like it's really clever I really like the the the structure

338
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:51,480
of problem sleuth how it manages to and he did it in just one year which is like incredible for sure

339
00:35:51,560 --> 00:36:01,400
for sure did you do either of you see did either of you see the the drama the drama that happened

340
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:11,960
this week on twitter with um uh Lindsay Ellis and Sarah Zed who's I have I have Lindsay Ellis blocked

341
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm mutuals with Sarah Zed so I'm surprised I didn't see at least some of this Lindsay Ellis

342
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,720
has me blocked even though we've never interacted we've never interacted I don't know why that's

343
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,000
super funny but I'm blocked by Lindsay Ellis for some reason you're on you're on the list Ben

344
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:36,520
I guess I guess I'm on the list uh um but uh okay all right so the the the drama with those two

345
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:46,280
and a third party who I will I won't I won't mention them oh anyway uh I don't know they were just uh

346
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,120
Sarah Zed I think tweeted that like don't do this like don't interact with creators in this way like

347
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm getting like weird messages from someone and then Lindsay Ellis replied to that saying like

348
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,720
I think I think she showed screenshots of them and Lindsay Ellis replied saying I think I think

349
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,160
we both are like having the same problem with the same person I'm getting inappropriate messages

350
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,680
from someone that da da da da and then she posted screenshots and it had the the icon in the name

351
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,800
blurred out almost blurred out there was a little bit of the icon showing and people um people like

352
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,720
looked at the icon and looked at what it was saying and it seems like the person in question might

353
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:36,440
have been Quinton reviews oh my god yeah and and like the the basic gist of it I should I'm not

354
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,000
gonna go and find them but maybe I'll post like screenshots these particular screenshots in the

355
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,360
chat you're saying I kind of Quinton potentially Quinton reviews was messaging Lindsay Ellis and

356
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,920
this other person in a creepy way yes well the thing is the the way they were talking about it

357
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,000
it sounded like oh this it's creepy it's it's inappropriate but like the content of the messages

358
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,640
it's inappropriate in the sense that like it's a little too familiar and sort of comes off as a

359
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,560
little like desperate but it's not like it's not like it's not like creep shit like sexual

360
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:18,440
shit it's just like hey how you doing you know uh uh you know uh I really like you and I like

361
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,600
your work and stuff and then like months later like hey you never replied to my message haha

362
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,920
like what's going on I'd really love to connect sometime haha months later hey you know I don't

363
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,920
know if I ever burn this bridge at some point that's why you're not responding to me haha okay

364
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,200
but if you ever want to like okay and then months later okay well I guess sorry sorry for this I

365
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,920
apologize you know just like lame see that's not even just lame it's just sad it's not good

366
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,640
they they didn't call it creepy yeah it's it's just it's just a bad look like I was just like a

367
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,840
sad look just because he got back at him almost subscribers doesn't mean you're actually hot

368
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:58,760
shit no no you know I don't know I just they were the way they were talking about it made it sound

369
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,760
like this person was like being really I don't know when I actually saw the messages it didn't

370
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,160
it didn't seem I didn't it didn't think it was as bad as they kind of made it out to be and I kind

371
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,560
of thought then the whole thing like Quentin looks like a loser but both of them just kind of look

372
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,560
like they're catty and like they're just like gossiping about someone and I don't think it's a

373
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,000
good look for anyone involved uh I thought it was I think the whole thing was gross well I haven't

374
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:30,120
seen any of this stuff I'm trying to find it but um the idea of the idea of like highlighting an

375
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:37,160
anonymous message saying hey guys don't do this in their defense to their credit they didn't they

376
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,480
didn't like deliberately try and out this person yeah but yeah so that's that's good that's I'm

377
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,320
glad that they didn't but I don't know if they wanted to if they wanted to talk about this this

378
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,880
person who like they both don't like in their DMs like I don't know they could have done it in

379
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,680
private if they wanted to if they wanted to they didn't have to do it in a public twitter thread

380
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:07,240
yeah I don't know yeah I I think that's valid I mean I get it I get why she'd tweet that because

381
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,080
like yeah like people on the internet do not understand boundaries and sometimes you just

382
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,080
want to let people know like hey don't interact with your faves this way it's really weird and

383
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,080
uncomfortable because it's like some of these people like maybe you actually like could talk to

384
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,760
them in like a reasonable way but just because of the way they approach you it makes it really

385
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,320
weird and awkward and like okay this is someone who clearly like is gonna be like they're they're

386
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,720
like if not a stan just someone who like has me on a pedestal and I don't want to like deal with that

387
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,920
so I think it's like it's reasonable to like ask people to like have boundaries and like understand

388
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,160
this shit it's just unfortunate that you know they didn't fully take the icon out and the dude got

389
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:05,800
exposed yeah and like it's yeah it's it's funny it's funny that it was between I don't know it's

390
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,400
funny that it was Sarah and Quinton because Quinton's bigger than Sarah Quinton has more

391
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,800
subscribers and yet apparently he was the one doing the messaging and she was like hey you know

392
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,160
lay off just because you're a fan that doesn't mean I'm your friend or whatever well I mean that's

393
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:29,400
the funny thing about YouTube or like web content in general is that um you can have a fave who

394
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,000
actually because this is something I discovered when I got like YouTube clout is that you can have

395
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,240
a fave who has like way less engagement with you and is way less popular than you but you can still

396
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:47,480
have that weird dynamic of like looking up to them and wanting to like like get in with them as if you

397
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,600
were like you know um as if they had some sort of like um yeah edge over you in terms of like

398
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:01,880
popularity because like all of you mean yeah like all of the people who I was like a huge fan of

399
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,120
prior to getting my YouTube channel were just like people in the ruby fandom which is like a big

400
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,880
fandom but it's not the kind of thing where you get like capital C clout like no one has like

401
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,560
very few people have like multiple thousands of twitter followers because of that or whatever

402
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:28,200
so it's weird like being a fan of people who like technically have like fewer followers than me but

403
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,920
it's just like the dynamic still feels like it's there I gotta say this this whole thing

404
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:43,080
I don't know even if I would class it as drama it's just it's so I don't know mild

405
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,160
is this what passes for like news on twitter these days just like a little bit of a social

406
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,520
profile like some people looking not so great I don't know when when two when two kind of when

407
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,160
two big like YouTube people are like talking shit about someone and it turns out to be a third

408
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,160
like big person and that I don't know that seems like that I think that's gossip worthy it does

409
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,840
appeal to like the um fuck you it does appeal to like the tabloid sensibility of like ooh look

410
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,360
at what your favorite like youtubers are saying about each other behind their back like exactly

411
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:26,040
exactly just burn them all all the youtubers get them in a room get them in a tuba room yeah kill

412
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:33,240
them just anyone over anyone anyone over a hundred k subs uh hang them hang them from the gallons I

413
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:44,040
would say in my opinion and yes yes in a video game in minecraft I guess oh if I have to minecraft

414
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,680
I was just so boring it sucks it's the lamest thing you could ever even think about

415
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:59,560
I can't think of a lame or though you know what's good you know what's better content oh no no that's

416
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:07,320
even worse I love I love content I love filling my face with content I'm seeing that my I'm seeing

417
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:14,360
that my fave krogsmash I didn't realize he had passed a hundred k subs he's up to 119 subs

418
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,760
have I talked about krogsmash you know krogsmash you know krogsmash I have never heard of krogsmash

419
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,760
what's he do I think you may have do you know dwarf fortress I do you know the game dwarf fortress

420
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I have heard of dwarf fortress well krogsmash is a dwarf fortress youtuber uh a a a dwoo

421
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,720
I don't know you'd call it sure um he does um you know he he builds fortresses and he'll like

422
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,200
he does like I don't know he'll like narrate the the games that he plays on the fortresses

423
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,280
that he builds and he'll like pick out little dwarf individual dwarves and like give them

424
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,320
little character arcs and do like art of them and stuff uh he's doing um he just concluded the second

425
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,880
annual uh splatter face tournament where he picks like random people from around his like

426
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:13,240
generated world to like come and uh fight in gladiatorial combat uh they two days ago the

427
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:19,720
championship bout came out and it was the greatest thing I've ever seen uh I literally teared up at

428
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:27,640
the end uh it's so fucking good I can't even believe it uh don't watch splatter face too go back and

429
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,240
watch the first this is my recommendation watch the first splatter face because the characters

430
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,800
in the second splatter face are like you know the ones that survived the first one come back and

431
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,720
you have you have to know you have to know all the lore you have to know like where the where

432
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,640
the battle beetle got his steel helmet and stuff like this is all this is all so crucial critical

433
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,640
dwarf fortress lore oh it's so some of the some of the some of the fighters in the second round

434
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,920
are so cool I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say who my favorites are because that'd be spoilery um

435
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,720
I'm always impressed when youtube channels develop lore that's more complicated than like

436
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:19,240
actual published properties like yeah did you ever look into siva gunner lore um I I've heard

437
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,120
about it I know I don't know anything about I didn't know that was lore I know that there's like a big

438
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:31,560
it's a big group effort to make funny video game rip music yeah what happened was when they first

439
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,840
started it it was just like posting high quality rips as they called it which were all very funny

440
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:47,800
mashups but what happened was over time to like mix things up I guess they started introducing

441
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:54,920
like plot lines to it where there would be like characters who like quote unquote run the channel

442
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,360
or take over the channel or something like that they kept adding like more and more of them it

443
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,920
got incredibly complicated and involved like I'm pretty sure like multiple universes and time travel

444
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:14,520
and like a a key element was smashing the motherfucking like button among other things it got like

445
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,680
complicated to the point where I could not even try to keep track of it and it's like on the one hand

446
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,760
is that like the best storytelling maybe not is it impressive as hell yes yeah there was what did

447
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,920
they do king for a day it was like a tournament they held yeah the public would vote on who would

448
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,120
take over the channel for a certain amount of time afterwards that was like one of the less

449
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,320
complicated things they did yeah I heard of that people I know were like involved with that

450
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:53,480
um I saw um I saw a new video from that channel that makes the knives you know oh yeah the knife

451
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,680
shines out of weird shit well I saw a new video I didn't actually make it out of smoke did he make

452
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:06,920
it out of feelings no he made it out of bismuth but the um isn't that an old video but the the the

453
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,240
video well maybe but the video was called making a knife out of bismuth to correct an injustice

454
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,280
and I I don't know what that means I assume it has to do with like the lore because I know I

455
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,960
watched like a more recent one recently and like there's like a story to them now like there's like

456
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,440
aliens and stuff and people in masks oh my god and uh yeah there's like a hot like a the main

457
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,200
character got like taken hostage or whatever knife channel is turning and it didn't even have anything

458
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:45,240
to do with the knife he was making knife channels like yeah turning into a shown in anime yeah

459
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,280
it does it has like plot lines now it's like an abstract

460
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,760
shit people love getting creative with stuff like it's it's difficult to like make the exact same

461
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,720
type of thing over and over again and so I'm sure like youtubers like that where they're known for

462
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,840
exactly one thing they're like I don't just want to make another knife I want to make another knife

463
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:12,760
and also this and then people get into it it's so silly that's definitely a real thing with

464
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,400
YouTube is that when your channel is like you make one kind of video and you make it over and over

465
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:26,440
again for like some people can do that indefinitely and I have a lot of respect for that but a lot

466
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,720
of people it's like you either get tired of doing the same thing or you have to find some way to

467
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,520
make it interesting for yourself by adding new elements or you just have to like move on to

468
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,440
something else entirely and people tend to not like that a lot of people on YouTube just want

469
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:50,280
you to make the same content over and over again forever it's I mean it does every every concept

470
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,640
seems to wear out as welcome I was like a subscriber of the hydraulic press channel

471
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,840
which is like oh yeah it spearheaded the whole like crushing things and seeing what happens

472
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,240
they were like the first one but they also one of the biggest and they kept doing those videos and

473
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:12,280
it they like iterate a little bit with like the types of things they they try to do but at the end

474
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,760
of the day you turn on the video like oh what is what is it this time okay let's skip to the part

475
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,960
where it explodes watch that five second clip and be like hey well that was satisfying I guess and

476
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,400
then I don't know it's just like I keep seeing them in my my subscription feed and I'm like it's the

477
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,640
same thing I know it's just gonna be another one of these explosion things under pressure

478
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,320
I don't care anymore on sub like they didn't do anything wrong I just got tired of the concept

479
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:46,680
and I I I know that they're not like changing it up enough you know it's different from like an

480
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:52,440
educational channel but would you want but would you want to watch it if it had like weird story

481
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,520
lines about like I don't know like a villain shows up with like a different press and like

482
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,520
it becomes like a contest about which one can crush things better it's not about one of them

483
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,480
steals the press and they have to go on a trip to Europe to retrieve it hey I think it's it's not

484
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:16,360
really like my job to figure out how to continually make that one concept interesting it's just that

485
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,560
I am tired of that concept and because there's nothing else to it I'm done I don't know how long

486
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,360
those sorts of things can last like either the creator burns out or the audience loses interest

487
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:34,200
and you need something more timeless more like rewatchable once you've seen something explode

488
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,640
you don't really need to see it again unless it was incredible

489
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:46,040
yeah I think uh that's true like some concepts just have a longer shelf life than others like

490
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,600
you know if you're just crushing things with a hydraulic press over and over again like you said

491
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:57,720
eventually it's like okay I've seen enough things get crushed by a hydraulic press to

492
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,200
know what all of the other things will look like getting crushed by a hydraulic press

493
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:10,760
just the nature of these concepts Krug smash has said that he has no plans to ever make any

494
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:18,520
non-dwarf fortress related content because like dwarf fortress has like such a massive possibility

495
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:25,080
space uh within it that being said he does like I mean the whole the whole splatter face like

496
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,560
tournament thing was probably was him like experimenting with like what else can I do

497
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:35,800
with dwarf fortress aside from just like building and running a fort and like his his new the new

498
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,920
fort that he's that he took a break from to do splatter face it's called um the watchful eyes I

499
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,480
think and it's like it's totally different from his other forts because it's not like a big uh

500
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,480
industrial complex it's just like a a group of like six dudes like trying to like for it be a little

501
00:52:51,480 --> 00:53:00,520
like a a band of rogues out in the woods in a shack somewhere uh so you know he he there's there's

502
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,800
you can mix it up you can mix it up in in many different ways there's many different strategies

503
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:16,760
one can employ I suppose yes very wise I find it to be like especially punk to to have like a list

504
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,360
of concepts that you want to make videos about making all of the videos and then stopping

505
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:29,560
like um like uh what was it every frame of painting they stopped once they had enough

506
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,000
of their ideas out there in video form and because of that they are like a complete package

507
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,640
and I occasionally go back and rewatch all of their videos because it's like ah it's just like a

508
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,800
series it's a box set those were very good videos they were very good videos but how can it be that

509
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:51,320
that person doesn't have any more like ideas of like here's a concept from film that I could

510
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:59,240
you know explain or or or dive into and discuss I ate no film so I don't know but um I mean

511
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,800
I I I know what you mean about it's cool to just like have a start and a stop you know it's like

512
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,400
it's like in bakuman you know they start making the fucking the fucking athello or the black versus

513
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,800
white the angel of manga like yeah yeah whatever it is it's yeah and then they're like and they try

514
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:23,160
to keep going they're like no we we had a story want to tell we just got to fucking get in tell it

515
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,000
and get out and when it's done it's done and that's how you make a fucking masterpiece and everyone was

516
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,320
like oh that's true yeah that's true but it's weird to do that about every frame of painting just

517
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,960
because that doesn't seem like the kind of thing that is like oh yep I've said all I have to say

518
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:45,560
about film I have run out of opinions on film it's it's not like opinions it's like the the

519
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:53,640
different methods of I think it's sort of the purpose that they had was to like give people

520
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:03,000
like a a a like a an easy to digest snapshot of like as many different film techniques and

521
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:12,040
ways to think about film as possible in easy to digest like videos and in that sense like they could

522
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:18,040
come back and like technically talk way more in more depth for hours about other things I don't

523
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,880
know that that was their mission statement as far as I understand I just like that it was a mission

524
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:28,600
statement and they finished it I will say I think a factor we're thinking about there is that like

525
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:37,880
the guy who made those videos was like a professional film editor and as a youtuber who has a day job

526
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:44,040
and likes my day job and doesn't want to quit it when you're in that situation the motivation

527
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:52,840
to make more videos is dramatically lower it's like I can it's like I can just quit this whenever

528
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,520
like I don't need this it's nice it's fun but like I'm under no pressure which is like a good

529
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:04,360
position to be in because like youtubers complain about burnout constantly but the flip side of

530
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:10,600
that is that you can be comfortable to the point where it's like I lose nothing by quitting this I

531
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:19,880
can just stop whenever I want I want I want I want youtubers to be so economically you know

532
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,200
distressed that they are just forced to churn out content the same the same content that I know

533
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,120
and love with with as little variation as possible please this the safest path to financial stability

534
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:39,000
should be their only path to survival that's that's the optimal ecosystem for me a consumer of content

535
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,320
just keep making the same content until you die that you're not allowed to have other jobs

536
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,080
all the good videos already exist there's no there's no point there's no reason

537
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:57,320
that's true that's true nothing will ever oh wait I've just had a great idea actually forget it

538
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,360
then I'm gonna come I'm gonna come back to making videos I'm nothing I'm gonna I'm gonna

539
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:09,080
ever top splatterface 2 championship bout I'm sorry but we peaked exactly two days ago as a society

540
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:18,280
what was that what splatterhouse thing the thing he was just talking about the entire yeah the

541
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,880
crumb smash tournament oh yeah you know sorry it was I wasn't listening and I will never listen to

542
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:30,200
you ever I know yeah yeah oh very nice oh cool give just her drip or fortress and immediately

543
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,480
zoned out look I know what they started there's small people and they're in a fortress and it

544
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,560
sucks to be them because they die constantly shut up they have a great time they love they love

545
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:47,080
drink and they love industry and if you run your fort well they get plenty of both all right if war

546
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,560
fortress will probably die in like a in like a werewolf attack would they be one block tall

547
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:59,400
in minecraft yes definitely um yeah because everything is a grid so everything would be

548
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:06,520
equally like wide and tall and deep everything is a cube um I do want to say I think I mentioned

549
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:13,480
before that my my roommates and I started a fort a couple weeks ago and it was called fern relics

550
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:20,120
and fern relics had a terribly just this week actually fern relics officially died several

551
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,800
weeks ago yeah okay fern relics was beautiful it was like it was built into the sides of this canyon

552
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,560
that these like that these two rivers converged in right so there was like cliff walls facing each

553
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:38,040
other well um you know we were just going about our business trying to like build and then but

554
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,200
there was a main bridge went over the top of the canyon uh with you know the canyon down beneath

555
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,200
it and just one day for no reason at all people are just milling about going over this bridge and

556
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,920
one dwarf just suddenly the full moon comes out and he turns into a werehorse and this werehorse

557
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:00,760
just goes apeshit on this bridge and slaughters like half the the population like 50 dwarves out of

558
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,880
like a hundred are just like bashed in with his hooves or like hurled off the bridge and fall

559
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:13,080
to their deaths and and because we live in an evil biome the the bodies of like all these slain

560
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:19,160
dwarves and animals like start coming back and they come back down in the river underneath the bridge

561
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:25,080
and the other dwarves find them so scary to see these like these like crawling undead like like

562
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,800
living that now like are just hanging out down in the bottom of the river that they can't cross

563
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,800
the bridge because they'll be trying to cross it and they'll see one of these skeletons moving and

564
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,200
then they'll get scared and run away um so nothing can get done in the fortress anymore

565
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,920
and then uh my friend took it took it for his year and he sent the our military on an expedition

566
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,680
to a necromancer's tower from which they never returned

567
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,800
and then like a huge swarm of like a hundred fucking ghouls and goblins and zombies just

568
00:59:53,800 --> 01:00:00,040
like swarmed down from the north and just devoured everyone and and and murdered them butchered us

569
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,560
butchered us wholesale so we had to abandon that fortress but we started a new one i think a little

570
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:11,880
bit to the east and the new one is called it's so fucking cool the new one is called steel father

571
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,240
and steel father is we're going to we're gonna build up our army we're gonna go back and we're

572
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:24,520
gonna reclaim fern relics we're gonna fight back the undead scourge and i'm so fucking excited

573
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,400
because all i wanted all i wanted to do when fern relics was find steel all i wanted to do

574
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,440
was get up a steel smithing operation and we just didn't have the minerals for it we didn't have iron

575
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,720
we didn't have flux stones so i'm it would be so sad and tragic if steel father doesn't have them

576
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:45,720
either but my fingers are crossed it should be okay hey it should be okay hey ben if if i were to

577
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:51,480
like buy i don't know where to get i guess on steam dwarf fortress um how how come you don't have to

578
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:59,800
buy it oh is it just a free i think you can buy it on steam but like it's just free also oh okay well

579
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:07,400
then there's no reason to not try it but um how like difficult is it to learn is it like like you

580
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:14,120
need to study up or is it just to jump in and see what happens okay there there's a lot to learn

581
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:19,240
but like basically it's basically you just basically have to get familiar with it and like

582
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,600
there are guides like the wiki just has a guide that will like walk you through like the the first

583
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:30,360
uh actually krug smash has a video called your first fortress which just walks you through

584
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,400
building a basic fortress and introduces you to like the basic mechanics it basically dwarf

585
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,360
fortress is just a series of menus that you just have to like navigate to do the things you want

586
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,160
to do and if you don't know how to do something you literally just like go to the wiki and look it up

587
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,440
and like find out how to access that menu and like that's how you do it um so you just kind of have

588
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:56,600
to play for a while with like the wiki open so you can like know how to do things uh and it takes a

589
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,080
little while like probably your first like fortress will just be a complete wash and end up like a

590
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:09,240
hideous monstrosity and you'll die but that's fine yeah that's just the way it is yeah i do like

591
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:15,000
yeah like base building roguelite type of things oh you should give it a try give you should give

592
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,520
it a try like kenshi if it was if it feels like kenshi even a little bit i'd probably enjoy it

593
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:29,320
our our our fern relics fern relics had a thriving mug industry like all of our best

594
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:35,880
stone crafters were making these like masterwork mugs and and and trading them with the other

595
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:42,680
groups and one of the relics that someone made was a bone scepter that was topped with a golden mug

596
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:51,160
and uh our our mayor was our our mayor was named muggin melville we gave him the name uh muggin

597
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:56,840
could he drink out of it i i like to think that you could yeah i like to think that you could um

598
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:02,360
and then like yeah mayor mayor muggin melville i think she like i think in the werehorse attack

599
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:08,280
she got injured and went into a coma and then like she was still in a coma when the undead

600
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:14,280
attacked and killed everyone and i think they killed her in the coma but then she like was

601
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,280
risen from the dead as a zombie and like her and the other zombies just started like beating the

602
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,320
shit out of each other and uh my friend john the for like one of the first things he did in the new

603
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:31,000
fortress steel father was he built over the well he built a statue of uh uh of muggin melville as

604
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,520
like a menacing undead as like a warning as like a warning against like this is this is what we're

605
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:43,560
fighting against you know never forget the tragedy that befell fern relics oh what a fucking game

606
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,640
the epic highs and lows of dwarf fortress it's almost as exciting as watching the bitcoin ticker

607
01:03:53,320 --> 01:04:00,360
it all just comes back to bitcoin eventually i'm almost as invested ben have you have you mentioned

608
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,920
that you sold it all i did yeah at the at the beat that was like the first thing i think i

609
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:15,720
mentioned this episode sold it all lost 200 bucks uh sad sad times in literally like one day i went

610
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:21,560
from being up by a thousand to down by 200 it was that bad easy come easy go

611
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,800
shit i've exhausted all the items on my list oh wow already yeah already uh what i know somebody

612
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:41,240
somebody else take over somebody tell somebody tell me what to think um uh well uh i mean the

613
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:47,640
only thing i've been doing the past week is my secret project my my secret mysterious construction

614
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:55,160
which is going along swimmingly same um same aside from that uh i've been oh i did a minecraft

615
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:03,800
hardcore right um but with the biome set to one biome desert so the entire map is desert

616
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:09,480
and it's hardcore so i have to try and fend for myself without the ability to easily collect wood

617
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:16,680
and it's actually really fun um because it involves a lot of uh figuring out how like you

618
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:21,800
have to find a village so that you can get food from them and then you have to trade and it's more

619
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:29,080
about like surviving than it is um just you know because minecraft is so easy you can easily become

620
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:37,800
super powerful and indestructible in a normal map but in a big desert uh it's it's scary you know

621
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:44,520
i've actually been i've actually been going into the pcp minecraft server once in a while

622
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:52,200
and just mining more marble just because it's fun i don't know oh uh give a hat next time next

623
01:05:52,200 --> 01:06:00,840
time we do a shekels for heckles i have a present for you oh oh in the game wow cool i uh i won't i

624
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:09,560
won't say what it is uh i said a diamond maron pan is going to be very mad uh but uh i'm gonna i

625
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:17,000
don't care but you're gonna like it you're gonna like it a lot all right no it's not a diamond

626
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:27,960
it's better believe it or not it's better than a single two diamonds yes exactly uh i've also

627
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:34,840
been playing a lot of noita i think i talked about noita before the like road the dungeon roguelike

628
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:42,440
that is also like a sand simulator yeah that one's weird yeah i think i think we talked about it last

629
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,600
time because oh yeah because you or was it on the stream that you said that it was that was the game

630
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:53,640
he was germa was playing when that thing happened when the when the debt was accrued yeah yeah it's

631
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,360
you ever um you ever play one of those like sand simulators like the falling sand games

632
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:08,520
uh oh no it'll be like a it'll be like a black screen and you can is lemmings one of those no

633
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:14,040
what am i thinking of no it's like you it's like you can like build up piles of sand and then lemmings

634
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:23,080
walk around no you fuck what do you mean said like you draw like you draw like you draw like a

635
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:27,800
metal like a line like a bowl or something and you can like drop sand and the sand falls and it's

636
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,440
like pixelated particle effects and you can drop like other kinds of sand like gunpowder or something

637
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,280
and then you can take fire and you can put the fire next to the gunpowder and the pieces of

638
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:42,120
gunpowder will start going and there's you can have like weird gases and stuff oh wait i think i

639
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:49,160
i played one of these when i was in like high school or something like that like a long time ago

640
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:55,000
i mean they're they're fun to like fuck around with yeah noita noita is like it's like that

641
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,960
physics system but it's built like these dungeons that you like have these magic wands that you

642
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,360
like shoot bullets out of and you like are going around killing monsters and stuff and collecting

643
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:10,360
gold uh noita is so fucking hard i thought i was like getting pretty far into it but i wasn't

644
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,080
i got to like the fourth stage like a couple of times but there's like there's so many like

645
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,440
hidden zones and like there's like there's like levels beyond my wildest dreams i have like barely

646
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:27,800
even scratched the surface of it i suck at video games so fucking bad it's so embarrassing i always

647
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:35,320
joke that it's so cool though i growing up i was like pretty much exclusively like an rpg kid like

648
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:44,280
i played final fantasy and pokemon and like a few other similar jrpgs and uh now my joke is like

649
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:51,960
final fantasy are video games for people who are bad at video games and that also applies to kingdom

650
01:08:51,960 --> 01:09:01,080
hearts yeah yeah i mean i played i played after like i got the playstation i think i was mostly

651
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:09,000
like an rpg guy you know i hadn't i hadn't nes uh as a little baby so i was you know i played like

652
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,800
you know platformers a bit i like platformers and stuff uh i'm best at like turn-based things like

653
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:22,200
pokemon i'm a pokemon master because i'm just like i'm just you know i'm just so intelligent

654
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,880
just so i have it's didn't think so many steps ahead of the average the average person it's just

655
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:38,120
like you know invincible huge brain individual uh yeah i mean i i've always been like a proponent

656
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:43,960
of like it's okay to be shit at video games it's okay to enjoy games in a casual way and be an

657
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:50,840
actual casual like straight up because that's me i don't like games that are difficult it is okay

658
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:57,640
but i really like noida and it is like frustrating to me that i'm like bad at it because i want to

659
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,000
win it because i like it well of course there's always going to be frustration when you lose

660
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,720
and you want to get good at things that's that's not the same as like and i mean it um like

661
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:15,560
feeling compulsion to be good otherwise well i feel i feel like i should be able to do it

662
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,040
because i've i've beaten hard games before like i've beaten i've beaten down well and i've like

663
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:25,720
you know i beat the old like hell binding of isek and stuff and i've beaten i've gotten pretty far

664
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:33,480
in like uh i think i've i've looped a few times in uh uh what's that one uh nuclear throne you know

665
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,760
is it safe i'm not like a complete shit game i'm not a complete shit game well hang on those those

666
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:43,800
all three of those so i expect better of myself all three of those games rely heavily on good

667
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,160
drops for like upgrades or whatever in between rounds or and stuff like that's heavily luck-based

668
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:56,520
all three of those noita kind of is too like that's that's why those games are fun and frustrating

669
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,840
because it's it's not it's not entirely just your skill it's also what you happen to come across

670
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,640
if you if you're good if you're good though you can you can do well in most games like that even

671
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,240
unless you get like the absolute shittiest of drops like most most games like that and like

672
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,800
even shitty drops like a good player can still like make that that's the thing i think i think

673
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,440
those games they they feel compelling to get good at quote-unquote to get far in them because in

674
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:30,760
the back of your mind you're always thinking well i could have got luckier if i played exactly

675
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,360
at that skill level but i got better drops i would have got further so there's still chance to get

676
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,880
further and it's like ah i didn't get as far as i could have if i got the right things

677
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,520
and but that you don't have any control over that so you just keep playing over and over

678
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:53,000
hoping to get the the perfect the lucky yeah it's yeah it's a bit of a slot machine yeah that way

679
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,080
sure but i think you were right in the sense of like if you play through these games enough

680
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:02,920
eventually like some of that luck sort of gets evened out by the fact that like you always

681
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,240
you're you're you've just learned all the mechanics so well that you can sort of make do even if your

682
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:13,960
drops aren't ideal so it does getting it does still have that getting sorry sorry it does still

683
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:19,080
have that um element of like challenging but rewarding like very much the uh dark souls of

684
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:27,160
video games getting good at binding of isaac was not about like you know being like really like

685
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,240
twitchy with my fucking finger movements or whatever like shooting bullets and just like

686
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:38,360
getting good at binding of isaac was about learning like where and under what conditions

687
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:45,560
rooms spawn and like how to use like keys and like what what like the most net benefit you're

688
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:51,800
likely to get from the way you use your early like keys and bombs and stuff to like uh true there's

689
01:12:52,520 --> 01:13:01,080
like which which yeah yeah but um so what's my point my point is that it's um i don't know i've

690
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:08,200
been like looking up guides noida feels like like i have learned about noida and like how

691
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,880
like its wand system works and stuff like that and like various like material interactions like how

692
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,920
you can if you put water in it in toxic waste the water will purify it and turn it into water

693
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,640
which is very helpful to know but even though i've learned a bunch i have not made it that much

694
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:30,120
further and it's i feel like i feel like noida is genuinely a like is maybe more luck based than

695
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:35,240
something else like binding of isaac but you can kind of like strategize around i don't know uh uh

696
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:42,280
noida's frustrating noida's really frustrating it feels i yeah you can you can die you can die

697
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:48,440
with like no warning in noida if you get if you fuck up your toast and then i get mad and i pound

698
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,040
my desk and my roommates say ben why are you pounding your desk and i say shut up

699
01:13:52,760 --> 01:14:01,560
told you never to ask about what i do i i've been uh fixated actually on a specific puzzle game

700
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:09,160
um pit cross or nonogram or whatever it's called um on this website because uh pit cross

701
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:16,200
it's like a grid and there's numbers on columns and rows and the the numbers correspond to

702
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:23,000
filled in squares uh that are like in groups so if there's a one three one that means you

703
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,760
know on that column or row there is one on its own three together and then one on its own in that

704
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:35,480
order and so you have to try and use uh the numbers on the on the on the rows and columns to figure

705
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:43,240
out which squares are like colored in and which ones are blank and it's so it's so like this is

706
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:48,840
my favorite kind of of like puzzle game where it's like a lot of deduction it's like a charlotte

707
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:56,520
homes which parts are like like guarantee that this block is colored in and then once i know

708
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,240
that information what does that tell me about the rest of the board and you can slowly get all of it

709
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:09,000
but this this particular site it like it randomizes the board uh like random number

710
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,880
generation just like comes up with things like pit uh pick two what did i call it pictogram

711
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,840
whatever that sometimes that they're made of like pictures so they they they like pixelated

712
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,400
pictures and if you know what the picture is you can kind of guess which is something i hate

713
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,680
i don't like being able to guess i like to be able to deduce everything so i do this random version

714
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:42,280
and it's it's so satisfying getting so far in this thing but every single time i get right to

715
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:48,920
the end there are a few squares which are like absolutely 50 50 coin flips as to whether they're

716
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:59,720
blank or not and i have to like roll the dice right at the end and if i get it wrong um i it says

717
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:06,040
mistake one like one mistake you fucked up you chose the wrong devastation it's like and and if you

718
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,360
completely game without getting any mistakes you get a big like oh wow amazing perfect and i want

719
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:20,760
that perfect so bad but the fact is it's like i hate luck based games i hate any game that has

720
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,480
a luck aspect to it and this game is so good except for the final little bit there's always a

721
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:39,880
fucking coin flip sucks i used to be super into uh hearthstone which is obviously a very different

722
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:44,040
kind of game but it's another one of those things where it's like because it's a card game there's

723
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,960
a lot of skill involved but there is also a tremendous amount of luck um and people

724
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:57,080
bitched constantly about the luck element because everyone is a salty bitch about losing and it's

725
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:04,360
always the developer's fault um naturally i i kind of feel hearthstone was all right it it like when

726
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:11,320
you lose in hearthstone it feels a little different from other games because it's like you build your

727
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:18,520
own deck most the time at least yeah and um you know you can stack your deck to be filled with

728
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:24,360
things that would make it more easily more easy for you to win if you get the right cards or like

729
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,720
you can you can have a safer deck that has less cool things well i'm saying this there's an element

730
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:36,200
of skill that goes into the luck of the draw which makes it less annoying than like uh some like

731
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,280
card games that use packs of cards where it's just like oh i have nothing fold can't fucking do it

732
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:50,520
um yeah i mean it like isn't it isn't in the sense that like that's true but what usually happened

733
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:58,440
was from my memory it was basically you'd get a like list of decks that basically everyone was

734
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:04,040
playing and oh yeah the meta was terrible yeah and so you'd always encounter like the same

735
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:09,400
shit over and over again and like eventually people got to the point where they're like if we're

736
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:15,160
all playing the same fucking decks like at what point is this just like luck of the draw um the

737
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:20,520
actual answer there is like none of you are actually that good so yeah a lot of it does come down to

738
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:27,320
that but like you know everyone thinks they're a 140 IQ genius so when you're really good at a game

739
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:33,480
like that you're not even just like it's not even about the cards entirely it's about building your

740
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:41,160
deck in response to like what decks everyone else is using yeah and like knowing what their what options

741
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:46,600
they have based off of what they've played already basically like being able to calculate okay if i

742
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:53,080
put this out where the odds gets a counter to me um yeah like yeah i i i remember certain points

743
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,840
where i would be watching like creperion videos about stuff just because it was fun and he would

744
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,080
play so many matches and i would see so many strategies that when i played it i was like

745
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:09,960
okay the meta for hunter right now is this and i'm fighting a hunter what is the likelihood he's

746
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:15,080
going to do these things hmm how should i play this sometimes it works sometimes i can actually

747
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,000
outsmart them because i know that they're trying to do a certain thing and i'm just not going to

748
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,040
let them do that one thing even if it means i'm not doing as much damage as i could otherwise

749
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,680
so it's a bit of strategy with that but yeah i don't know when i when i lost control of what

750
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,680
the meta was and i started losing everything i was just like whatever fuck it never again

751
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,680
i don't want to buy hundreds of thousands of packs to get all these new cards

752
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:50,200
i have i have avoided my my friends play uh magic and i have since like last year or so i

753
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,760
i have i have i think i made up my mind like i'm never playing another card game ever again

754
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:00,520
i i don't have the fucking mental energy to the vote i look to like a whole new side hobby like

755
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,480
that i just i just i don't want it i don't want it in my life i love card games but extremely

756
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:13,320
valid like they do consume a lot of mental like brain space and uh that's not something that

757
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:18,360
you necessarily want to commit to especially because you also end up like dumping a lot of money into

758
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,560
it it's like yeah uh yeah i mean there's that too mo it's it's the it's the it's the mental

759
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,920
energy though that's the real killer because i know you can build like you can build like a

760
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,760
pretty decent magic deck for like not too much money yeah they have like and if you want it to

761
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,600
be like good then it like takes exponentially more and more money there's like a whole format

762
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:44,360
to get it past being pretty good in mtg that's just based around using cheap cards i'm pretty sure

763
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:51,640
yeah yeah there are i mean there are uh i mean most of my most of my friends play uh uh what is it

764
01:20:51,640 --> 01:21:01,800
the Highlander or the Elder Dragon EDM EDM EDH no ED yeah that's it EDH yeah they probably listen

765
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:10,760
to EDM Highlander right uh no they listen to like fucking they listen to uh like fucking

766
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,200
some i don't know i was maybe they didn't that's the soundtrack in my living room has been a lot

767
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:22,760
of like old uh uh like snes rpg uh soundtracks which is good and i like oh yeah that's the other

768
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,600
kind i always think of like when like music that like nerds listen to it's like a specific

769
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:35,800
kind of EDM i'm not sure like what the technical name is for it but it's discord i'm howlin yeah

770
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:41,240
yeah i always i always think of it as i always think of it as the EDM that furries listen to

771
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,920
um fuck yeah i don't know if there's a specific name for that genre it's that like electroswing

772
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,080
which oh swing music that's been put a funny beat on it you know like caravan palaces

773
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:01,640
no there are the people who did that music video with the furries getting into a bar fight oh

774
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:08,440
i i've seen that that there's a lot of blood and and a gazelle with tits yes yes yes yes

775
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:15,960
that's the one yeah caravan palaces is like that their genre electroswing which is like EDM

776
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:23,880
with swing influence um but like the double bass but sped up or something yeah yeah i think i

777
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:31,960
remember okay i might be off bass here but i think like last week vosh tweeted that like

778
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,000
he likes electroswing like that's all he's just said hey guys i kind of like electroswing

779
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:43,640
and i guess there was a big backlash people got upset that he said that no that makes sense i mean

780
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:49,720
just like i i watch a lot of anthony fantano and he has said on numerous occasions that

781
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:56,760
electroswing is like the only genre of music that is just bad like there is nothing he can

782
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:03,000
find about it that is any good and so it's so funny i'm pretty sure i mean okay okay but people

783
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,080
would have said that people must have said that about new metal back in the day and now it has

784
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:13,800
its defenders right i mean i don't you know he can't he can't seriously mean that new metal has like

785
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:21,800
i mean here new metal has like a couple of good songs like i don't know the alien ant farm

786
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,960
cover of smooth criminal and i think i think there's a case to be made for break stuff

787
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:35,320
i don't know that that's that's a limp biscuit to this it's like okay i i hate learning about that

788
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:41,720
song because now when i uh use the phrase it's just one of those days the first thing that

789
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:47,880
it's just one of those days yeah that's what pops into my head i'm like damn it fred durst okay

790
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,320
well i've i've never heard i don't know what electroswing sounds like but i i know that i have

791
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:01,800
like some real basic bitch taste in music um for i mean my canonically my favorite song is uh uh

792
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:08,520
what's the word uh what's that wake me up what's the word when you make it high pitched

793
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,560
no what's the word when you make it high course the night nightcore remix of hillary duff's come

794
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:19,800
clean is my my favorite song so so i probably would also like electroswing i feel yeah is there

795
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,840
is there like overlap because it's bad because it's bad yeah i would say the overlap between

796
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:31,720
nightcore remix um the audience for nightcore remixes is also the audience for electroswing

797
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:39,240
which is i knew it which is also the audience for um euro beat remixes of stuff euro beat brony

798
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:49,000
yeah euro yeah yeah and by extension discord um is also the audience for like vocaloid music so

799
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,680
why don't really i don't really like vocaloid stuff i've heard like a couple decent vocaloid

800
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:00,200
songs and then a lot of the other ones just sound like the same but worse yeah i'm with you on that

801
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:06,520
i cannot get into vocaloid i've heard a couple that sound good but most of the time yeah it's like

802
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:12,520
the the like there's a choppiness to the vocals because they're like you know computer generated

803
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:21,160
so it's always gonna sound a little bit off i like jazz fusion that makes me smart that makes me

804
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:27,560
i just need a song to have a real good like catchy like really energetic driving beat that

805
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:33,320
hooks me and that's all that's all i really need that's all i really need in a song uh and hillary

806
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:39,720
duff's got it baby do you think do you think nightcore country would improve country that's just

807
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:47,480
caught in ijoe it probably would it probably would yeah i mean any song is better if it's

808
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:52,280
nightcore because it's just faster which means like you're getting a higher density of like song

809
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:57,720
dude what if what if what if you do nightcore vaporwave then it would be just be normal

810
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:05,800
yeah that's true night nightcore um what's that what's that one vaporwave song

811
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:15,480
the the only one there is oh lisa frank 420 well that's the album or is that the song the album is um

812
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:22,280
uh fuck i don't know i always but yeah that song that song is just like a slow down album

813
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:29,320
is floral shop and the song is lisa frank 420 the lisa frank 420 is just like the really slowed

814
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,280
down version of whatever that that other song is so yeah if you nightcore it you just get the

815
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:39,240
original song back but better yeah exactly i'm like all distorted let's audio artifact it yeah

816
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:45,560
audio artifact yeah yeah just all fucked up it reminds me of that post that was like um

817
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:55,240
i've had enough of these uh lo-fi anime beats to relax and study to where are like the uh high

818
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:03,960
energy anime beats to dance and party to and someone was like nightcore hell oh my god i found it

819
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:11,160
nightcore lisa frank 420 here we go um enjoy uh uh wait wait here we go

820
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:18,200
somebody somebody's got me covered when you listen to this oh this sucks

821
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:25,720
it's not even faster it's just pitched up oh that's lame doesn't doesn't accomplish the goal at all

822
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,920
this is awful no whoever made this is a fucking hack and that's why they only got 523 views

823
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:41,320
down vote i disliked this no thank you disliked unsubbed i'm gonna subscribe and then

824
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:53,000
what a disaster devastating disappointment f got my hopes got my hopes up so high just like bitcoin

825
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,640
it got my hopes up so high only to just come crashing down really just cannot think about

826
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:06,200
anything other than bitcoin today i have today it's been months i have i have i have we i have

827
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,680
wean like at the beginning of this month at the beginning of this week it was literally it was

828
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:16,680
like i was literally like i had that on screen constantly and i was constantly looking at it

829
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:24,120
so i'm like i'm like i'm like i'm like asymptotically approaching you know zero bitcoin engagement

830
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:29,480
but like you know it's gonna take me a while it's gonna take me a while to disentangle myself

831
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,800
thank you walk thank you very much i'll get there i believe in myself

832
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,480
so what else what's uh what's what's what's what's going on what's your life what's your

833
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:52,840
life like um so my current project is i'm working on uh a new when posting goes wrong about sonic

834
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:58,200
for real justice i don't know if either of you have ever heard of this did you post a tweet

835
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:05,800
with some screenshot of like your file folder yeah that's the research for that okay i don't

836
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:18,120
know what that is at all okay so in okay so in 2015 right uh there was this blog that took over

837
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:26,920
tumblr for like a hot week or so and it was like an insane like fever dream of an event

838
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:36,200
while it was happening um basically this post went viral so the blog was called sonic for real

839
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:44,760
justice right um with a number four i said no no no um it was spelled out but basically like

840
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:55,080
at the time on tumblr there was like a backlash to the proliferation of like sjw content

841
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:04,360
and so you started getting blogs that were like anti sjw blank or blank for real justice and so

842
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,000
where they were like either just straight up i think some of them were just straight up like

843
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:17,160
right-wingers but a lot of them were like uh lgbt exclusionists so they were like sure trans people

844
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,160
who were like really like particular about who's allowed to call themselves trans or like people

845
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:31,400
who thought that like ace people weren't lgbt or stuff like that um i understand yeah and but the

846
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:38,440
thing is because it's tumblr and everyone ran like fandom blogs people started like crossing the

847
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:48,840
streams so you'd get like anti sjw kyogre or like naruto for real justice so like as other

848
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:54,040
other accounts that other people were running yeah so people would like start a blog where it was

849
01:30:54,040 --> 01:31:00,680
like them and a bunch of their friends like um was it a was it a joke or was it like these people

850
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:07,480
were serious a lot of these people were serious where they were like face claiming quote unquote

851
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:14,680
like they were basically rp-ing as like various fictional characters talking about why like

852
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:21,880
neo pronouns are invalid and shit sonics the name i'll keep this short and sweet trans male gay true

853
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:27,880
scum anti special snowflake what you see is what you get just a guy who loves adventure sit back

854
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:33,160
grab some popcorn and enjoy the blog yeah so that was the original i'm looking at know your meme

855
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:38,680
that was the original mod sonic intro what really took off was the mod shadow intro which i'll do

856
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:47,800
my best yes i'm my shadow male and the atheist anti sjw anti feminist anti gun control pro logic

857
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,840
i chose shadow the hedgehog as an internet persona as i relate to him when it comes to his hatred

858
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:59,720
of humans or in my case social justice warriors these sjw's think that fighting fire with fire

859
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:06,760
will accomplish something well in the real world it won't i hope that one day these pathetic sjw's

860
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:17,480
will come to their senses um and unsurprisingly that post was a big hit and then people went to the

861
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:27,640
blog and what they discovered was like a tangled web of uh mod drama where i want i want to say

862
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:33,800
that it's it's tagged with like hashtag sjw hashtag anti sjw hashtag sysphobia

863
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:40,920
hashtag hetero phobia hashtag racism oh yeah they put like every possible tag on their intros

864
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:48,680
to try to get more people looking at them um yeah very nice but they'd like they because basically

865
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:53,640
it was like they created a bunch of rules for like what the mods are allowed to do and like what

866
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:59,080
they're not allowed to do and like almost immediately one of the mods broke a rule and they kicked

867
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:04,280
him out and then they all started going back and forth where people were like justice for mod

868
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:11,000
silver we got this guy who like has never said anything like they kicked him out for not posting

869
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,640
and then closing the ask box and they're like all right you're gone and then everyone immediately

870
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:23,880
rallied to his side people were like so invested in this drama um i think in large part because

871
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:35,480
of the absurdity of it all and and it was all like how how serious was it so like um so this

872
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:39,960
is kind of like the big twist at the end so if you don't want to be spoiled for the eventual

873
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:47,720
sonic for real justice video you can dip out now i i doubt anyway but um yeah basically

874
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:56,840
like uh they ended up after like a few a couple of weeks doing this they stopped getting as many

875
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,640
notes uh like people sort of stopped caring about the blog and so they eventually just like pulled

876
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:08,040
back the curtain they were like all right this was a joke like it was it was a whole time um damn

877
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,960
but the funny thing the thing i find like super funny is that after they they took off the mask

878
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:19,320
and told everyone what was happening they eventually brought it back um initially as a

879
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:26,600
danganronpa blog and then later they switched over to yugioh but they kept some of the danganronpa

880
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:31,480
characters and now they're back to sonic but like there's still characters from various other

881
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:37,800
franchises hanging out as well so it's kind of all over the place very nice but very nice

882
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:43,480
what we eventually but like if you kept following them after all that time which not a lot of people

883
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:50,920
did what you eventually learn is like the danganronpa phase ended because they brought on a bunch of

884
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,480
other mods because originally it was only like i think three people and i think they added a

885
01:34:55,480 --> 01:35:02,840
bunch of other people who then started like actual serious drama with each other because they had

886
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,800
like a bad breakup and they tried someone tried to like accuse the other person of being like an

887
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:15,320
abuser which is pretty typical like tumblr material sure and then i'm glad i was never on tumblr

888
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:23,400
you're i dodged the bullet i feel like you both did and did not miss out there was a lot of good

889
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,920
stuff there but i mean it's like twitter in that there's like a lot of like there's funny stuff

890
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,280
on there and then there's also stuff that gives you brain damage i personally think tumblr is a lot

891
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:40,280
less harmful to my mental health than twitter because like on tumblr on tumblr you make a

892
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:47,880
bad like you'll see a bad post and you can like rest assured that it's like some 17 year old who's

893
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,960
like never left their hometown oh whereas on on twitter you see a bad post and it's some fucking

894
01:35:53,960 --> 01:36:01,320
op-ed writer for the new york time exactly or like a fail son with like three high paying fake

895
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:12,840
jobs like yeah so it's just a very different vibe you know um so like um yeah but we eventually

896
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:18,680
learned so right very sorry um so they eventually had to like kick those people out and like reboot

897
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:26,600
but eventually someone they when they went back to the sonic theme they started a discord server

898
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:34,680
and a bunch of their fans got in it and at least one person like made a post where they

899
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,800
after talking to these people like full mask off where they were just being themselves they found

900
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:48,040
out that like the mods were aphobes and so yeah they they didn't think asexual people are lgbt

901
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:55,960
okay and so got it basically the big joke with sonic for real justice is that this was a bunch of

902
01:36:55,960 --> 01:37:04,920
people pretending to be a group of exclusionists uh starting ridiculous drama with each other

903
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:11,400
while face claiming fictional characters and eventually it turned into a group of exclusionists

904
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:17,000
just actually starting drama with each other while face claiming fictional characters so the answer

905
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:26,760
to was it all a joke is yes but also no yeah i was just pretending to be smart i was yeah i was

906
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:37,560
just pretending to be joking essentially that's yeah that's like you you you would have to i don't

907
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:42,360
know you that's kind of what i expected because like like obviously this is ridiculous when you're

908
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:47,640
when you're being sonic and shadow but also like why would you commit to this bit like i don't know

909
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:53,000
you would you would have to have some level of commitment to it i don't know it's or that just

910
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:59,560
seems like the most likely thing like um this is a joke but it's a joke about like what they like

911
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:05,720
it's funny to them because it's what they actually believe i think they did exaggerate like they

912
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:12,280
definitely are they that's the weird thing is that they eventually said that they were like only

913
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:18,120
pretending to hold some of their views in that like i think originally they were like a lot more

914
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:24,120
arbitrary about like these specific kinds of non-binary people are like

915
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:30,680
trans-trenders or too cute or whatever the term is and then eventually too cute yeah it's this is

916
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:40,120
this is the deep uh lgbt lore right here um okay but but eventually uh they like later on in the

917
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:45,240
blog where they weren't like um where they were being open that they were playing characters

918
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,400
someone was like yeah we don't actually believe in that stuff we accept all non-binary people

919
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:55,320
but it's because the eighth the aphobia thing ended up being legit it makes you wonder how

920
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:00,840
many of their views were their actual views and how many of it was the character it's it's just

921
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:08,360
such a urban such as like playing with fire almost like you know going around oh uh i'm playing a

922
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:13,880
character online uh he's racist and he says racist things all the time and he hates different races

923
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:19,880
but you know the joke is that that's so silly like who would believe these things like why would you

924
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:26,120
even call out post i mean i don't know i've never watched filthy frank um but i've heard he's funny

925
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:32,200
and cool didn't didn't didn't filthy frank didn't he have a have a redemption didn't he turn around

926
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:37,480
and be like didn't didn't he quit because like he didn't like people taking seriously the stuff he

927
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:43,800
was trying to joke about it was a combination of things he quit in part because the like

928
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:50,840
filthy frank voice did like actual damage to his vocal cords and he couldn't do it anymore

929
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:59,320
which makes sense if you've ever heard him talk um but the but yeah i think part of it was that

930
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:06,600
like the problem with doing a character where the joke is this is the worst guy on the planet

931
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,760
and you're supposed to laugh at him is that the audience for that is actually just the worst guys

932
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:18,520
on the planet because they were the only ones who can tolerate that content long term um yeah

933
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:26,520
and so it was it was both things and also i think he just got sick of doing like shock content um

934
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:33,400
because what he did after that was he became a fucking lo-fi indie artist who is now like super

935
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:40,120
successful and popular and so i think he probably always wanted to do that to some extent um and

936
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:47,320
like i don't know good for him for like getting like a quote unquote real career but also i have

937
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:54,360
as a as a lo-fi like no come on no i think he was pretty successful like like in terms of

938
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:01,640
like all internet jobs are fake jobs that's like a no it's he's like he charts like when he puts

939
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:08,120
out new songs and everything he like um every music's fake music's not even real unless it's

940
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:13,560
every so often someone will like dig up like it's fake until you make it nightcore that's how you

941
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:20,120
make it real oh my god can we get someone can we get someone to uh pitch up and speed up some of

942
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:26,200
Filthy Frank's tracks thank you might make it more listenable only then will i listen i'm of the

943
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:32,760
extremely i have the extremely hot take that um the music that Filthy Frank made as pink guy when

944
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:39,800
he was making like dumb meme music is better than his like quote unquote serious music he's

945
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:48,680
made as joji because like there's a million guys making like lo-fi like sad boy indie pop but

946
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:54,360
there's only there was only one guy making a song about um letting a dog lick peanut butter off his

947
01:41:54,360 --> 01:42:00,440
balls and like we're not gonna we're not gonna get that back you know it was a moment in time

948
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:11,880
and it's passed exactly sad uh i never uh i never watched Filthy Frank either uh i just know him

949
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:19,960
from wearing a pink suit and i've heard that he said funny things he had a couple of funny videos

950
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:25,080
but like i said the problem with playing the worst guy on the planet is that it's kind of hard to watch

951
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:31,240
a lot of that content sure is he like an idubbbz or was he like an idubbbz type

952
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:39,640
or is it yes more extreme was it in fact i'm pretty sure he was like i'm pretty sure he was

953
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:45,320
friends with some of those guys yeah i mean i like idubbbz he's a bit of a strange guy but he's cool

954
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,200
oh

955
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:58,280
i'm too busy i'm too busy getting bitches in the real world to be watching all these uh

956
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:06,760
all these fucking youtubers yeah based yeah it's based based on you having zero bitches

957
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:16,280
i collect them and then i hang them on my shelf

958
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:25,320
tell me more tell me tell me more no fact no give us more content more content more content

959
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:30,360
you don't have any more content um then we're gonna have to move on to voicemails

960
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,880
and you know what happens when you move on to voicemails she gets weird and it gets scary oh god

961
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,880
i mean i'm looking forward to getting weird and scary because i'm just curious

962
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,440
i don't know now now they're gonna be lame and stupid this is only two modes of the voicemails

963
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,920
yeah historically historically they're usually lame and stupid so

964
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:57,000
should we do should we do some should we do some voicemails might as well yeah

965
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:07,720
okay uh all right yeah not nonchalant committal to voicemails okay i'm sure i'm sure our callers

01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,600
someone once described um dany sex bang as uh a dude who's like 40 years old and his entire

980
01:45:50,600 --> 01:46:01,400
personality is that he has sex with girls who play legend is elda and that really does play out

981
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:09,080
in his music and i feel like he definitely got some good girls who play legends he definitely

982
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:14,120
got some good songs out of that devastating like there are limits you know you can only do that

983
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:19,400
shtick for so long before it gets old i have i have not listened to much the first time i heard

984
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:23,880
unicorn wizard but the first time i heard unicorn wizard i thought it was really funny but then

985
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:30,360
like the more the more uh ninjas x party i heard the more i was just like okay all right that's

986
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:36,520
it's very one note in in terms of like i don't know what he what he feels like he can sing about

987
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:44,360
and starbomb was even more like just like like locked in on like well let's take a video game

988
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:49,720
that's uh you know a Nintendo franchise and like i don't know i mean i think starbomb was like that

989
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,320
i think starbomb was like that on purpose starbomb was like that on purpose because i

990
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:57,560
kind of think it was made to be marketable it's made it's made to be like lowest common denominator

991
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:03,640
like video game humor it's just so it's so much worse than what they say on game grumps i just

992
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:11,240
it's exactly the same vibe as um do you guys remember brental floss i know of him a little

993
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:22,520
sort of yeah same vibe is him same vibe is like all like nerd core um a genre that i think uh

994
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:30,120
deserves to be made fun of um wait what's nerd is it just like referencing things that are cool

995
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:42,600
as in it's it's rapping about nerd things it's not a very good combination my i run a patron

996
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:48,840
discord server for my hardcore simps and someone in that server introduced me to the world of league

997
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:58,120
of legends hip hop oh no um which just reinforced my joke that it's called uh lol because you gotta

998
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:05,960
take twice the ls when you're playing that game i i totally i i believe it is there is there like

999
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:12,520
um i think the problem is like fighting game hip hop the the huh what i could i could i could see

1000
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:17,400
there being hip hop about league of legends like i could see there being hip hop about like fighting

1001
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:23,160
games because like the fighting game i don't know like the competitive the competitive atmosphere of

1002
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:29,960
it i don't know feels like it's something you could write fucking angry raps about yeah i think i

1003
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,720
mean if they have it for league of legends i would think they would have it for like

1004
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:40,360
street fighter but maybe not maybe i'm no you can you can do it it's just fucking stupid i think oh

1005
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:47,880
well so is all human endeavor to get right down to it in general as a theme is usually

1006
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:56,200
stupid and lame but there's a few examples of like have you heard of protoman i got introduced

1007
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:03,240
to them recently they they it's a mega man um they or they made two albums protoman act one and two

1008
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:10,280
i can't remember what i think that was what i know protoman um and they were like prog rock like um

1009
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:17,000
epics operas right yeah like uh like rock operas and and like the production was very good and it

1010
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:24,040
wasn't just like listing the mega man characters it was like a story was being told with these

1011
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:28,760
characters as like a base of inspiration and i was like okay you know that's actually pretty good music

1012
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:35,880
but it's video game um but when you when it's when it's like when it's like music video game

1013
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:43,560
like i i don't think it's like a a guaranteed fail machine to talk about video games in in songs

1014
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:49,960
it's just like a lot of the time what gets people hyped up is just hearing the franchise they know of

1015
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:55,400
and then the amount of like creativity that you need to put in for something like that to be

1016
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:01,240
successful is so low that people often don't need to try and so they don't and so they just

1017
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:06,200
i can imagine the league of legends hip hop is just talking about a video like a like a like a

1018
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:11,800
match and something bad happened and they got fucked up and they died and they lost hate hit points

1019
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:17,080
and they just sing about it for a little while it's like oh yeah i love league of legends i'll

1020
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:22,200
click on like and subscribe and pay i think you're on to something in the sense that like

1021
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:28,680
because you're just trying to get people who like the game to click on it by virtue of liking the

1022
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:35,560
game the song doesn't need to be as well produced yeah because i think actually because while we

1023
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:41,080
were discussing this i remembered the one example of like a dude who makes songs that's just that's

1024
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:49,080
everything that brony's ever made yes um but that just reminded me of like the one example of like

1025
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:55,240
people making music about nerdy things that was actually good which is fucking uh ken ashcorp

1026
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:02,760
who makes songs about like hentai but somehow makes it like listenable and catchy so it's like

1027
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:11,400
you can do this um but like but it's so easy to not it's it's so easy to not bother and still

1028
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:19,000
succeed so it's like yes it's gonna be a lot of crap of that type exactly i think that's that's

1029
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:26,360
reasonable i've heard of ken ashcorp i've never heard their i want to i want to hear like a sudoku

1030
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:37,400
rap oh my god a minesweeper like uh well uh wait wait who was that who was that digimon

1031
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:43,320
youtuber who i was we were talking about a while ago and like that guy wrote original like digimon

1032
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:49,000
i don't think he wrote raps i think he made like heavy metal songs uh maybe he rapped i don't remember

1033
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,640
you could do like metal heavy rap i could actually see doing metal about video games

1034
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:01,480
more than hip hop about video games because like a lot of metal is already like the the lyrics are all

1035
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:08,280
like like fantasy shit like a lot of there's like a long history of of metal that's just about like

1036
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:15,720
dragons and like um like lord of the rings shit and i feel like it's like not that much of a jump

1037
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:28,920
you know can't find his fucking name uh that fucking guy he was he was he was my hero i wanted to

1038
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:37,960
love anything as much as that guy loved digimon fuck okay whatever uh commenters let me know

1039
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:44,600
um next voicemail yeah yeah let's go okay here we go here we go that one wasn't that bad

1040
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:50,440
that one was okay okay yeah we're on it we're on it we're on a roll we're on a streak of one

1041
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:57,800
uh this one is called wall street bets oh boy three oh god it's a minute thirty fuck you wall

1042
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:08,280
street three three two one go all right so ben i know you're really interested in bitcoin

1043
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:15,080
i was bitcoin sucks okay terrible investment facts shout out would not invest it myself because

1044
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:22,200
of the high volatility uh same with you gib i know you don't invest but you should actually consider

1045
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:28,520
investing you misinvested that one way to make money you will have to be a capitalist in order

1046
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:34,680
to utilize the tools in your tool belt for capital appreciation so the fucking thoughts

1047
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:41,880
that first find your portfolio etc if you want any more information about this google

1048
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:49,960
that's your best friend for it but also consider opening a account with robin hood not a sponsor

1049
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:56,120
but not a sponsor no i don't even know how to start this podcast i didn't thank you for us today

1050
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,320
who would be paying this motherfucker and you can still buy bitcoin with that okay is robin hood a

1051
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:06,840
if you want to buy bitcoin for cheap well not cheap but uh have no fees because i didn't know

1052
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:12,200
paypal has fees either and i was gonna never did buy it on robin hood no commissions at all

1053
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:18,280
easily sign up and if you guys are for each other you get a free stock so everyone wins but

1054
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:26,440
i want you to look more into stock investments uh really look into it and actually try to

1055
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:32,360
maximize your returns he's right he's right i know that like over the over the long run

1056
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:38,040
over the long run he's he's best to invest in the market itself this guy has the capitalist voice

1057
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:44,280
i'm going to want i'm gonna give legitimate advice here if you actually want to make money

1058
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:52,920
investing the way you do it is that you invest in what's called the vfi and x which is the vanguard

1059
01:54:52,920 --> 01:55:01,080
index fund which is basically it just tracks the s and p 500 and whatever the s and p 500 is

1060
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:09,080
worth that's how much it's worth um and that's like the only good investment because as we have

1061
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:17,320
learned this year uh the forces that be will do literally anything they can possibly come up with

1062
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:24,280
up to and including killing hundreds of thousands of people just to make that number keep going up

1063
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,400
and so that's great if you're that's a great idea and so if you're invested in just that

1064
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:37,000
you're going to keep making money i'm literally going to fucking fuck bitcoin i'm putting all

1065
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,200
my savings in no and the better right now that's like actually a legitimate strategy and the thing

1066
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:48,440
about it is that it's like unlike bitcoin for example the reason why it's nice is that you don't

1067
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:53,160
have to watch it and in fact if you do watch it that's actually a bad thing because if you see it

1068
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:56,920
like yeah go down a little bit you're like oh shit sell everything and then it just goes back up

1069
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:03,160
like two weeks later and you're like fuck so yeah it actually like takes that burden off you that comes

1070
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,640
with a lot of like day trading and other kinds of investment where you have to like constantly

1071
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:12,840
be thinking about it it's just you set it and forget it and you get like a little return

1072
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:17,960
every year and it's boring but like you make a little money okay do you get more than do you

1073
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:23,400
get more than you'd get from just your typical high interest savings fund yeah yeah definitely

1074
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:31,400
more than uh than a savings account well sounds good i was i was i was considering i was looking

1075
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:35,240
at like which saving funds give the highest like yearly return the other day and i was like there's

1076
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:40,360
got to be something better there's got to be something better than like 1.9 percent i'll think

1077
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:45,800
about it later yeah i never did this is more like five to ten i think depending on the year

1078
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:55,000
yes i love money no i love money so much it's the worst thing ever no it's thinking about

1079
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:03,320
investments and give me give me yours i just makes me want to uh not think about it it's what it

1080
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:07,320
makes me want to think about it makes me want to just makes me want to go just makes me want to go

it's just do we know you or if not that do we watch your videos yeah i got um when i was doing a

1102
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:43,240
podcast a little while ago i got an email from some dude who was like hey can i be on this and i

1103
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:50,200

1106
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:13,720

1107
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:22,040
if you want to be on the podcast you you can't really just ask and say like i i have opinions and i

1108
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:29,960
i know matt and koff from rfck i mean is that what he said is that in here near the bottom

1109
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:35,960
like i'm sure i'm sure he has his own rfck wiki page i'm sure you're cool on rfck.mirahease.org

1110
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:41,560
but i i think wiki slash notorious revolutionary tommy j i think it would be like i don't know if

1111
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:46,440
you wanted to be on the pcp and spout an opinion about something a better way to do it would be

1112
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:52,440
through the voicemails i just just talk about whatever and then we could discuss it through

1113
02:00:52,440 --> 02:01:00,520
that i don't know if this is like this is this is adorable but uh yeah yeah i don't know the point

1114
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:06,200

i mean he rewrote the lyrics to be about someone who's a wagey and working bread garlic

1176
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:41,640

1177
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:48,120
know aside aside from the bread garlic house um it's it is a cool problem to have that you just

1178
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:53,160
you're too busy to procrastinate i think that's pretty good god i wish that were me as long as

1182
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:19,400

1185
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:41,240
uh next voicemail is called where is it here we go it is called use your natural assets to

1186
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:52,040
incept ideas into the common man oh no okay three two one go what's up pcp let me tell you a story

1187
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:58,280
i am a six three blonde person living in the suburbs of japan so needless to say i stick out

1188
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:03,800
now the other day i went to my local supermarket to do some grocery shopping and in the entrance

1189
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:10,520
part of the store they have two hand sanitizer dispensers nice i was a fairly busy time of day

1190
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:15,800
so we were a bunch of people entering the store at the same time in like a line with me at the back

1191
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,880
as we were entering a single japanese man was exiting the store and used the hand sanitizer

1192
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:27,240
dispenser on his way out upon entering none of the people ahead of me used the hand sanitizer

1193
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:34,680
dispenser at all so i thought hmm now after doing my shopping the tables had turned and now i'm the

1194
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:40,840
one exiting the store as a new batch of people enter so on my way out i use the hand sanitizer

1195
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:46,680
dispenser in view of all the entering people so upon exiting i look back at the entrance to see

1196
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:52,120
that everybody who just entered were now like queuing up at the hand sanitizer dispenser to

1197
02:10:52,120 --> 02:11:00,120
use it so basically i am a hero and a manipulative mastermind using my foreigners as a power to

1198
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:09,080
do good do you all have any epic idea inception stories please tell us so until next time you

1199
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:18,600
accepted the idea of getting all these easterners to use the hand sanitizer by using the hand

1200
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:26,440
sanitizer that the store had put out for people to use am i reading this correctly i think which

1201
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:32,280
is extra hilarious because the implication the implication here is that because he's white

1202
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:39,000
they wanted to do the thing he was doing because they didn't care when the first guy did it i would

1203
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:44,440
i would think that the fact that you are look weird would make them like less likely to just do

1204
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:51,720
what you do i don't know i don't know if i agree with the conceit that if if if you see somebody

1205
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:56,920
using the hand sanitizer if i do it if i see someone i'm like oh yeah i should do that because

1206
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:00,680
it's like it's just sensible like you wouldn't if you're not thinking about it and then you see

1207
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:05,240
someone do it you'll be reminded oh yeah that's probably a good idea yeah i i guess if you go in

1208
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:10,440
and there's the hand sanitizer but no one is using it maybe you don't think oh i should go use it

1209
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,840
yeah people just and maybe you see the first person go use it and you go oh okay everyone

1210
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:19,000
it's like at a party you go to a party and no one's eating the food and no one wants to be the first

1211
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:25,720
one to eat it and then but then someone eats it it's like okay i can have some nice um so i guess

1212
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:32,040
that's true following mentality it's it's something everybody has a little bit of have i ever have i

1213
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:39,320
ever incepted an idea into a crowd uh no i'd like to think i've i've sometimes done that but like

1214
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:45,880
it's never been particularly like interesting just sort of i don't know i held the door open for

1215
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:50,840
someone or whatever and that sort of made a queue behind me of people holding door open for other

1216
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,880
people whereas before it was just being swung in people's phases i've seen that happen a couple

1217
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:01,720
times but it's like you know whatever nobody wants to look like the less cool the less good person

1218
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:07,640
so everyone gets manipulated into doing it i can't say i've had an experience like this i will say

1219
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:13,560
though as a as a gaijin as a white person living in japan uh i appreciate this person

1220
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:19,880
for um well wait are you a guy no no no i'm saying i'm saying like okay based on my knowledge of

1221
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:26,600
gaijin um yeah because i have a couple of friends who live in japan um he said sayonara at the end

1222
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:33,720
but i appreciate that other than that he did not use any gratuitous japanese throughout his message

1223
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:41,480
where he really didn't need to use it um like he could have common he could have very well said

1224
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:48,840
going going to my local super that's the grocery store he could he could have he could have started

1225
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:58,040
the email with a voicemail konnichiwa yeah that's a that's a joke that's a that's a there's a there's

1226
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:04,680
this samurai who is after me because i stole some sacred scrolls it's not a don't worry about it look

1227
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:09,880
deep i shouldn't i i shouldn't have even brought it up honestly but yeah he could have done like

1228
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:18,760
all according to keikaku and shit um and he chose to restrain himself he chose to contain the uh the

1229
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:25,080
weeb instinct and i have a certain degree of respect for him even if i think this story is

1230
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:31,160
kind of lame honestly yeah it's a little lame it's just that you did a thing and people saw you

1231
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:37,240
doing it and we're like oh it's too bad i sometimes feel i i i know the feeling that i sometimes feel

1232
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:41,160
a bit of pride when there's like something that people should be doing that they aren't and i'm

1233
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:45,080
like well i'm gonna show them i'm gonna do it in view of all these people who i know are watching

1234
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:49,400
me because i i have anxiety about that and i'm i'm certain everyone's watching me do this cool

1235
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:56,920
thing that's good they'll think i'm so good and they never do they never they never pay any

1236
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:05,400
attention it's all in my head uh next voicemail yes next voicemail is next voicemail is just called

1237
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:08,520
ben three two one go

1238
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:21,720
it's like i under water okay yeah right he just like set it through his through a blanket i don't

1239
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:28,840
know i don't know thanks thanks for the voicemail i guess uh next one next one is called flat

1240
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:31,960
three two one go

1241
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:39,720
look the only way you can prove that the earth is round is you need to circumnavigate north to south

1242
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:43,560
and you need to make sure you're going in a perfectly straight line

1243
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:49,480
and you need to need to record how we're doing

1244
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:55,240
this is so bad

1245
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:04,520
i'm too lazy to look into it uh so i'm just gonna just add until until someone present evidence

1246
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:11,480
otherwise okay i can't uh bro fix your fucking mic i can't why is sent like it felt like this guy

1247
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:18,440
knows how to make a voicemail he's doing this on purpose um for some reason yeah i couldn't i

1248
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:23,800
couldn't make out a word in that um but i imagined something funny that it was just like it was an

1249
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:30,040
it was an explanation of how you would prove that the earth is round or flat or something i don't

1250
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:35,720
know to me i was imagining garfield with his blanket covered over his face you know when he

1251
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:42,920
does that yeah maybe he might have been just like on the other side of the room like talking

1288
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:55,320
literally like a day or two ago wait wait but i think was the joke there that the girl was black

1289
02:20:55,320 --> 02:21:01,240
was her name did she have like a black name wait does that make a difference let me back what

1290
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:06,600
what he's he said the girl's name i'm gonna have to play part of this i'm just i'm i'm curious

1291
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:14,360
like she said i only date black guys and then he like responded as if he were a black guy was that

1292
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:22,600
his bit no no the bit was that he just changed well let's show yeah yeah he gave her like a

1293
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:28,840
like a stereotypical sounding like black girl name so no my tweet does not apply um yeah he's

1294
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:33,720
just he's just making a racist joke i i thought he said Clarissa in which case your would tweet

1295
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:41,560
your your tweet would apply yeah is that the tweet by the way was about the the genre of

1296
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:48,760
white girls who uh who make a liking black cock a core of their personality yeah is that common

1297
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:55,000
is that common outside of like porn it's more common than it should be that's for sure um there

1298
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:02,120
is an entire i watched like a whole video about this the other day um they're like i've i've

1299
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:09,800
used to back when i was uh still on tinder uh as a man no less i did encounter a few of them um

1300
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:16,040
obviously did not actually get any messages out of that but i could tell well if they didn't like

1301
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:20,760
black if these white girls didn't like black cock they'd be fucking dogs instead so we should

1302
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:29,080
count our blessings jesus christ i uh one time i was at work and one of my co-workers was talking

1303
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:35,400
like very casually about like taking a bath with her dog and i'm like why are white women like this

1304
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:41,240
there's giving your dog a bath and then there's taking a bath yeah no no like taking a bath with

1305
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:50,040
your dog i was like do you people have no about wait isn't that be extremely like messy and annoying

1306
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:55,400
did the dog consent to the bath you fucking psychopath there's no reason to do that that

1307
02:22:55,400 --> 02:23:00,120
oh maybe it was a small dog maybe it was a tiny little dog because like i'm imagining like you

1308
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:07,480
know you take a dog on a walkie get him back and then he's just like like running all over the place

1309
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:13,400
shaking and then you try to bath him and there's like splashing everywhere it's like yeah i can't

1310
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:19,480
imagine taking a like a bath with a dog they'd go insane they'd go all over the place if it's like

1311
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:25,560
if it's like a little a little like chihuahua like a little doxin or something that's like handheld

1312
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:35,240
maybe yeah but the size of a nintendo 3ds what you you just you just you just a multitask you

1313
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:40,680
can like oh you can bathe yourself and your dog at the same time why not i mean you get my little

1314
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:46,120
life preserve and i can splash on the in the other end even if it is convenient i still wouldn't do

1315
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:52,600
it this is weird it's just weird i just don't want to you just gotta do that you'll get dog um stuff

1316
02:23:52,600 --> 02:24:05,800
dog dirt in your bathwater that's not good um um uh but to this guy um yeah women be racist indeed

1317
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:16,680
women women be racist uh it's next voicemail wait what no say no no it's no come on say it no

1318
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:21,160
it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a thing i was gonna say it was just like i was just gonna say oh it's

1319
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:29,400
true lol but it's like who cares this is stupid wall wall lmao uh next voicemail is called uh cross

1320
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:35,480
source material and adaptations three two wait hold on

1321
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:43,640
is it is it is it racist to say you only date black guys because what i think what i think the fact

1322
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:49,400
okay i actually do this on this day the fact that she did add him means that she was maybe willing

1323
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:55,400
to date him even if he's not black but she said that after he messaged her so i think she didn't

1324
02:24:55,400 --> 02:25:00,840
like his approach changed her mind and was like i only date black guys in the same way she might be

1325
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:06,200
like uh no i have a boyfriend or uh no i'm a lesbian which is just like oh right i don't want to talk

1326
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:10,360
to you i don't want to say no because that's sad that makes me feel like a bad and changing your

1327
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:15,480
approach being like hey why don't we we could make dinner together wink and then she's like ha ha

1328
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:20,760
no and then be like okay new approach uh baby let me fucking smash that put it doesn't that's not

1329
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:25,320
gonna work it's transparently like you're changing your like that's a really weird

1330
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:30,760
and like you're i don't know i think i think you just put her off i think this is what happened here

1331
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:36,120
well what we have to consider here is the fact that this is a fake story that didn't actually

1332
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:42,840
happen that he made up for the voicemail um because that could be a scenario make way more

1333
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:48,120
sense because the punchline it's it's just to build up to the punchline that she has like a

1334
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:54,680
stereotypically black name like that's it's just like a dumb black i don't even know how that's a

1335
02:25:54,680 --> 02:26:01,560
joke really it's not it's because it sucks you know what you know what i am taking this

1336
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:07,640
seriously only date black guys anyway it's it's not even a is that a i don't know whatever

1337
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:15,480
um like like like what about her being a black girl would have been a clue for him to be like oh

1338
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:22,600
she would only like black guys and then and him getting upset is like the joke is like ah you

1339
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:27,000
should you shouldn't have got upset because of of course she would like black men only because

1340
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:33,880
she's black i don't get what the is that like reality does that happen the punchline the the

1341
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:40,760
rug is meant to be pulled out from under us when we initially agree with him like yes this girl is

1342
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:46,440
racist for only wanting to date black guys but then aha the twist ah but she was black and black

1343
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:52,520
people can't you see it's just such a strength i don't think i think i mean either way the joke

1344
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:58,760
sucks so i don't think it matters yeah okay all right we should move on i've given this i've given

1345
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:05,480
i've got we wasted a lot of time on that guy too much time this one is called cross source material

1346
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:12,840
in adaptations three two one go so i recently watched all eight harry potter movies and did

1347
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:17,080
not like any of them and this got me thinking about whether or not reading the books would have

1348
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:21,640
made the movies better seeing as i have not read any of them and that got me thinking about the

1349
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:26,600
relationship between adaptations and the source material they are adapting should an adaptation

1350
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:31,800
assume that its audience has read the source material how much should an adaptation be compared

1351
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:37,640
to the original versus judged on its own merits and is your opinion of an adaptation given more

1352
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:43,640
or less validity depending on if you have also consumed the source material discuss i have the

1353
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:50,840
second one um i have an actual hot takes on this okay as for the second question uh everything

1354
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:56,200
should be able to stand on its own if you need to have done other reading to get the most or

1355
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:03,160
it should be able to be like acceptable and you know at least good you know

1356
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:09,960
with potential room for improvement if you know but it should be able to stand perfectly well

1357
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:14,840
on its own without needing to have seen the adaptations or like the source material or

1358
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:21,640
whatever um i don't know about like whether your opinion matters more if you've read the book and

1359
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:28,920
watched the film i think you could make a perfectly good movie that assumes that someone

1360
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:34,840
has read the source material and like simply doesn't give a fuck about like anyone that hasn't

1361
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:40,200
sure but then but then i would i would like personally i would just think of that as a

1362
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:47,800
worse movie because there's plenty of ways to make an adaptation be perfectly good on its own

1363
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:52,040
despite source material like lacking things from the source material if we're talking about books

1364
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:58,360
that always happens books and film all right um i'm i'm gonna come through with some hot some

1365
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:04,600
spicy opinions on this first of all i don't think you should have have to have uh seen the source

1366
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:10,680
material in order to consume the adaptation because quite frankly i do not want my media to come with

1367
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:17,080
homework uh but more importantly i think every adaptation should stand on its own

1368
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:26,280
because the best adaptations are the ones that uh fully utilize their medium to the fullest extent

1369
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:35,320
like for example the godfather is an adaptation of a book that like critically no one cared about

1370
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:42,200
it was just like a decently popular piece of genre fiction but like it wasn't like the greatest

1371
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:46,920
one of the greatest books of all time but it was adapted into one of the greatest movies of all time

1372
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:55,320
because the filmmaking took like full advantage of the medium and created a piece of entertainment

1373
02:29:55,320 --> 02:30:00,920
that only works it like works better as a film like once you like the reason it's so good is

1374
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:06,120
because of the filmmaking and not because of the story underlying it and so similarly if you're

1375
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:10,440
going to do like a book adaptation a really good book adaptation would take advantage of the fact

1376
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:18,360
that it is a book and not just try to you know like recreate a movie or whatever so i think and

1377
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:24,200
like the same goes with like video games like a video game adaptations or like video games based

1378
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:32,280
off of like other media usually suck because they're just trying to like recreate the other media

1379
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:38,920
like point for point and it's like always kind of underwhelming um and like the few times that

1380
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:43,640
isn't the case is when it kind of goes off in its own direction like knights of the old republic

1381
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:48,840
or something like that so i think adaptations should be allowed to just be their own thing

1382
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:55,880
entirely because they're usually better um when you let them do that yeah that's probably the

1383
02:30:55,880 --> 02:31:05,400
objectively right answer but actually here's what here's my uh dissenting opinion uh not really um

1384
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:11,160
i don't know i'm i'm really i'm struggling to justify like what's what's like what's an example

1385
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:19,560
of like an adaptation or a sequel or something that like doesn't that is like totally inaccessible

1386
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:23,720
that is made to be totally inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know the source material

1387
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:30,120
but like it's still good and i i mean it's obviously it's not gonna it's not gonna stand on

1388
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:35,880
its own it probably won't be like you know it can't become like a timeless in a way that something

1389
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:41,720
like godfather does uh oh you know what's gonna be cool though there is actually a good example of

1390
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:51,160
this please give me one have either of you seen revolutionary girl utena i know we've talked

1391
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:56,920
about it on this show a bunch of times but i've never seen it oh that's funny yeah so revolutionary

1392
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:04,120
girl utena is a very very good anime one of like the best anime of the 90s highly recommend it but

1393
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:10,600
after it finished um they decided to do a movie of it because it was so successful

1394
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:19,160
and rather than do like a sequel or a prequel or whatever um the neon genesis avingelian end of

1395
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:25,960
ava you you can't you can't you can't watch that without like knowing that's the plot that's another

1396
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:31,800
very good example is that would you really think of that as an adaptation of a source material

1397
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:37,480
though i think that's just like a different thing as a part two like a so it is in a different

1398
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:44,600
medium my is okay correct me if i'm wrong doesn't end of avingelian because the last few episodes

1399
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:50,920
of avingelian take place in shinji's mind isn't end of avingelian just what's happening outside

1400
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:57,080
his mind during those episodes it's it's not it's not i mean you can interpret it that way

1401
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:04,280
or you could say that end of ava is basically just like they rewrote the end of of of the first

1402
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:10,440
one and they are like competing cannons with each other gotcha uh or something but something like

1403
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:16,520
that yeah um what were you saying about utena though yeah yeah yeah so utena is basically

1404
02:33:17,320 --> 02:33:25,480
instead of like doing a sequel or something for the movie um ikuhara the creator utena decided to

1405
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:34,680
essentially remake the tv show and like tell the story in like a slightly different way

1406
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:42,600
but he's telling a story that was originally spread out across like oh god like 39 episodes or

1407
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:50,120
something like that in like an hour and a half movie um and like it is the movie is an absolute

1408
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:56,600
god damn mess it includes a lot of callbacks to the show that make no sense unless you've seen

1409
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:03,560
the original um a lot of like dumb in jokes and shit there's like so many parts of it that are

1410
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:13,080
just complete gibberish if you haven't seen the series but if you have like it's still a mess

1411
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:18,440
but it's like a really fun ride and you can still like get a lot out of it but i feel like if you

1412
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:22,920
haven't seen the original it's just kind of frustrating because you never have any idea

1413
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:29,560
what's going on because it doesn't take the time to explain anything to you right and and but that

1414
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:38,200
in that way then if you you haven't seen the original or rather the yeah the show it's bad

1415
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:46,040
then like does it suck as a standalone piece okay but yeah i think the fact that it's bad

1416
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:51,880
it's okay the fact that it's bad to one audience and good to another like like neither of those is

1417
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:56,840
correct but i think this is like the closest we can get to the thing you were talking about of

1418
02:34:56,840 --> 02:35:03,720
like a thing that is good but also requires you to have seen the original because if you if you

1419
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:08,360
haven't seen the original then the natural consequences that you're not gonna get whatever

1420
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:15,000
you're supposed to get out of it and so therefore for you it will be bad i'm i'm sad that this question

1421
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,880
wasn't really about harry potter because i like talking about harry potter i thought that's where

1422
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:28,840
it was going uh i'm uh i'm uh more and more ashamed to be to have been a potterhead with each

1423
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:37,320
passing day it was fine it was good it was good it was good it was kind of good it was kind of good

1424
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:42,760
it was pretty good come on come on everybody everybody everybody knows everybody knows it was

1425
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:47,320
good everybody knows that it was it was pretty good at least except like the weird the weird

1426
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:54,200
ending was kind of done when you think about it for the the what am i thinking of age demographic

1427
02:35:54,920 --> 02:36:00,040
like for that sort of audience it was great it's a bit weird to get into it as an adult

1428
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:08,120
i don't know why people um it wore out it's welcome like not i mean not for me i mean like

1429
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:16,920
maybe after it ended it started still wearing out it's welcome for me before jk rolling went like

1430
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:25,320
full transphobe um when she started just tacking shit onto it um and then yeah the thing that like

1431
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:31,400
extra soured me on it was the phrase her mayony 2020 like as soon as people started saying

1432
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:36,840
shit like that i was like i didn't see anyone saying that in earnest but i heard about it

1433
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:44,360
whoa and i know this the sentiment is that like it was about them 2020 no it was about warren right

1434
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:48,600
people that were like we should vote for warren because she's her mayony because she has a plan

1435
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:54,520
yeah it was it was more just like there was a certain kind of person who's like really into

1436
02:36:54,520 --> 02:37:01,240
harry potter who would like relate shit in politics to harry potter and it became like a huge meme for

1437
02:37:01,240 --> 02:37:06,520
a while of like oh my god please read another book i mean that's just that's just particular

1438
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:15,400
fandoms potterheads hoovians things like that single track mind annoying the stuff about jk

1439
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:21,320
rowlings like the thing she used to tweet would they would range from being like actually irritating

1440
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:26,440
to when she the time when she was like oh yeah there was a jewish wizard at hogwarts of course

1441
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,440
his name his name was barry goldstein and i've never mentioned him before but he was there all

1442
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:39,800
along uh you know duh um very obnoxious to like the other stuff like the thing about like wizards

1443
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:45,480
would just shit themselves and then oh yeah like that was just fucking hilarious like that's great

1444
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:51,240
most of it was just stupid not all of it was offensive but a decent amount of it was also

1445
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:57,000
offensive where did the shit yeah it got yeah yeah did they did they act right i liked this somewhere

1446
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:04,200
they would vanish it which i think means that it's just gone i'm not sure exactly how harry potter

1447
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:10,360
magic is goofy it it's not mine system it has rules but the rules don't make any fucking sense

1448
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:16,440
have you have you read them or like how familiar are you i read um so this became like a joke at

1449
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:20,760
some point for me that i read the first six books and then never read the seventh and then watched

1450
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:26,360
the first seven movies and never watched the eighth so i still don't know how harry potter ends um

1451
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:33,240
oh my god um i mean i i it ends really weird it ends really weird yeah i hear the ending's bad

1452
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:38,680
so i never had like the motivation i would say i don't know if i would say that it's just bad but

1453
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:43,880
it's like it's just it's just strange and i don't know i don't know that's all i can really say about

1454
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:50,040
it uh uh i was compelled i found it compelling as a kid yeah the last minute they introduce all these

1455
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:57,800
weird like extra macguffins that end up being like fucking key it's the wizard world operates on like

1456
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:02,040
it's all about rules like there's tons of rules but they don't make any sense and they're made up

1457
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:10,200
completely as it goes along um yeah the whole yeah i never was like too um uh critical like

1458
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:15,640
thinking of of the rules i just sort of like took things as they came like i you read them as they

1459
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:20,680
come out and if you don't you don't like cross reference them you don't find contradictions

1460
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:30,280
then it's just it's fun but like yeah clearly was made up a lot as it went um like retro retro fitting

1461
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:38,360
the the various things from the the previous books as the horcruxes it's pretty i mean i don't have

1462
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:44,200
proof that she was doing that but it feels like that all these things that just so happen to be

1463
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:52,200
very important later right at the end there's like the rule that like you can't you can't make food

1464
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:59,080
you can't make food with magic that's like a fundamental law of the universe you can only

1465
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:09,720
make it with no food yes you can only make it with slave labor uh but it's okay because they like it

1466
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:17,800
the the slaves like it though yeah they don't want the sock diving into the political implications

1467
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:23,720
of harry potter is a podcast in and of itself you're right you're right you're right how many

1468
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:30,360

02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:12,440

1474
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:18,200
already know about myself which is i will laugh at anything stupid like i just have i'm an individual

1483
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:20,680

02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:52,520
that's me

1487
02:42:52,520 --> 02:43:03,960
have developed the number one weapon to take down ben no sento sun once and for all

1488
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:11,000
i will introduce samurai bottle three thousand

1489
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:13,720
oh

1490
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:30,760
all

1491
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:35,400
ha ha

1492
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:59,560
It's a robot, no explanation as to why the robot is good.

1493
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,560
It's just a robot.

1494
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:01,560
It doesn't have weapons.

1495
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:08,880
It probably does the same thing as the regular thing.

1496
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:10,760
You just said fuck all you.

1497
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:16,320
That's all it had to do.

1498
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:19,400
Alright.

1499
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:22,520
That's well okay.

1500
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:25,320
I guess there's plot development on that front.

1501
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:26,320
Sure.

1502
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:27,320
Oh god.

1503
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:35,840
Last one is called 9 year old anime girl, huge titties, 3, 2, 1, go.

1504
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:41,080
On the topic of cartoon character age is not mattering, I was watching this one anime where

1505
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:46,560
this character was like 9, but her character trait was that she had the hugest tits in

1506
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,560
the entire cast.

1507
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:48,560
Is it the gray hair girl?

1508
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:53,080
And it was really clear that the animators really wanted you to fuck this character

1509
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:57,680
because her tits were so huge and they were like the focal point of every scene she was

1510
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:58,840
on.

1511
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:01,680
So yeah, just don't worry about it.

1512
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:05,960
I want to fuck this 9 year old anime girl and I don't care what Twitter has to say about

1513
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:06,960
it.

1514
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:07,960
That's taken, that's really run in.

1515
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:11,880
That's really run in with what I said a little further than I meant.

1516
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:19,060
This reminds me of last time I said about the girl on My Life Me, I said she was cute.

1517
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:27,140
This reminds me of another anime, which I'm 99% sure is not the one he is talking about

1518
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:32,220
that also has like an elementary school or with giant tits.

1519
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:34,060
That one is called Aiken.

1520
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:35,820
Have either of you seen Aiken?

1521
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:36,820
A-I-K-E-N?

1522
02:45:36,820 --> 02:45:37,820
E-I-K-E-N.

1523
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:40,820
Wait, is that really old?

1524
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:42,700
I think I may have seen bits of that.

1525
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:43,700
Yeah, it's old.

1526
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:44,700
It's an old OVA.

1527
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:45,700
Yeah.

1528
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:47,700
Pretty funny looking.

1529
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:59,380
It's like, there was a period of time where this was like the go-to for like examples

1530
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:02,300
of shitty anime boobs.

1531
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:08,820
Like if you just wanted like a generic gif of like giant anime titties bouncing around

1532
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:13,140
in nonsensical ways, you'd pull a clip from Aiken.

1533
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:14,780
These don't even make sense.

1534
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:17,900
No, they look terrible.

1535
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:21,340
But I mean, this is obviously a matter of taste.

1536
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:24,700
Oh, are you talking about the pink-haired one with the glasses?

1537
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:26,100
Yes, yes.

1538
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:31,060
She is exactly who I was thinking of when he said a nine-year-old with huge tits.

1539
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:32,060
Radical.

1540
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:35,820
So this show is awful, unsurprisingly.

1541
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:40,420
For me, it's one of those things where it's like so bad that it loops back around and

1542
02:46:40,420 --> 02:46:42,060
becomes funny again.

1543
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:48,300
So like, I get a good laugh out of it because it like, it sucks so hard.

1544
02:46:48,300 --> 02:46:52,180
And it's also one of those shows where like, this is funny because this loops back around

1545
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:54,340
to the adaptation thing.

1546
02:46:54,340 --> 02:47:00,140
It's an adaptation of a manga, but the manga is like, had actually been going on for a

1547
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:04,500
long time, but they only had like two episodes worth of OVA to do.

1548
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:09,340
So what they decided to do was like, all right, let's just cut between like the very beginning

1549
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:14,580
of the show where we introduce like the main character and then like some highlights from

1550
02:47:14,580 --> 02:47:16,060
later in the manga.

1551
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:20,900
So things just start happening with no explanation.

1552
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:24,260
You have no idea who anyone is.

1553
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:32,460
You're just watching wild antics unfold on screen against the will of God.

1554
02:47:32,460 --> 02:47:33,460
Okay.

1555
02:47:33,900 --> 02:47:41,300
That one on the right, that one on the right in that picture with the short hair, her,

1556
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:42,300
is that a boob?

1557
02:47:42,300 --> 02:47:43,300
That is that pink?

1558
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:44,300
No.

1559
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:45,300
Or is that like her gut?

1560
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:50,380
No, that's just like her sweater, just like, it's like the wind or something.

1561
02:47:50,380 --> 02:47:52,020
She doesn't look like that.

1562
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:54,860
That's not like how she normally looks.

1563
02:47:54,860 --> 02:47:55,860
That's all right.

1564
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:57,100
That's she looks really weird.

1565
02:47:57,100 --> 02:47:59,500
Yeah, it's just a weird picture.

1566
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:07,540
Yeah, it's it's just like an anime that like it never takes its foot off the accelerator

1567
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:14,820
and it's just like that for two episodes and then it's done and oh wait, I've seen this.

1568
02:48:14,820 --> 02:48:18,700
I've seen this image before.

1569
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:19,700
That is for making.

1570
02:48:19,700 --> 02:48:20,700
Yeah.

1571
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:21,700
Yeah.

1572
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:22,700
Okay.

1573
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:23,700
Okay.

1574
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:24,700
Good stuff.

1575
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:25,700
This is what I mean when I say like for a while.

1576
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:26,700
Okay.

1577
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,700
I've seen a bunch of these.

1578
02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:28,700
Yeah.

1579
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:33,140
This was like the go to for like bad anime titties.

1580
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:38,820
And if you think that that's funny, if you're like me and you're horribly immature, you

1581
02:48:38,820 --> 02:48:40,900
will get a good laugh out of Aiken.

1582
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:46,900
I don't know about like watching a whole show of something like that.

1583
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:52,060
Well, you said it was an OVA, so like, not that funny because I'm scrolling down the

1584
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:55,900
Google image results and like, okay, yeah, I've seen a bunch of these gifts.

1585
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:58,500
I probably used to see them on 4chan or whatever.

1586
02:48:58,500 --> 02:48:59,500
Yes.

1587
02:48:59,500 --> 02:49:00,500
This is like, yep.

1588
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:03,260
4chan or like, I don't know.

1589
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:04,260
Some other anime forum.

1590
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:05,260
Something awful, maybe.

1591
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:06,260
Yeah, probably.

1592
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:07,260
Yeah.

1593
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:08,940
But yeah, it's like, it's two episodes.

1594
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:11,380
It's like an hour total.

1595
02:49:11,380 --> 02:49:12,380
When you combine.

1596
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,380
Have you ever seen the fucking?

1597
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:14,860
Have you seen Garzi's wing?

1598
02:49:14,860 --> 02:49:16,820
I have seen Garzi's wing.

1599
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:17,820
Okay.

1600
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:22,220
And if we're talking about, if we're talking about terrible OVAs, that's a, that's, that's

1601
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:25,500
a good one that we've discussed here on the show before.

1602
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:26,500
Oh yeah.

1603
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:28,140
Garzi's wing is very funny.

1604
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:29,140
It is.

1605
02:49:29,140 --> 02:49:31,820
It gets less funny as it goes on, though.

1606
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:34,660
The fact that it was made by the dude starts off really strong.

1607
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:38,620
It was made by the dude who created Gundam, right?

1608
02:49:38,620 --> 02:49:39,620
I don't know.

1609
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:40,620
Maybe.

1610
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:45,020
I think so, which like makes it funnier that it was that bad.

1611
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:49,380
It can't have been like written by him, though.

1612
02:49:49,380 --> 02:49:53,860
It can't be like, he might have been involved, but it can't be like his brainchild.

1613
02:49:53,860 --> 02:49:54,860
There's no way.

1614
02:49:55,020 --> 02:50:00,740
The thing about Garzi's wing that it was just sort of badly made, not necessarily that

1615
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:03,980
it was like, um, badly written.

1616
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:08,980
Like the, the dub is really funny because of how bad that's, it says, but like, I thought

1617
02:50:08,980 --> 02:50:10,220
it was just sort of.

1618
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:14,500
It was, it was, it's, it's largely the dub that is the problem.

1619
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:18,300
It was written and directed by the creator of Gundam.

1620
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:24,020
And also from what I've heard, while the dub is unbelievably shitty, the anime still

1621
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:26,380
sucks even if you watch it in Japanese.

1622
02:50:26,380 --> 02:50:27,380
Yeah.

1623
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:30,140
But I bet it's not like hilariously bad.

1624
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:31,140
I bet it's not.

1625
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:36,220
No, I think I've watched one or something and it was just sort of, it seems like they

1626
02:50:36,220 --> 02:50:39,500
didn't have a lot of money or something.

1627
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:40,860
It's like, what is it?

1628
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:45,620
That show ghost stories, the one where they gave it the ridiculous gag dub.

1629
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:50,260
The reason why they did that was because in Japanese it was also a shitty anime, but

1630
02:50:50,260 --> 02:50:53,580
it was shitty in the normal way where it's just boring.

1631
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:57,860
And so they were like, well, if this anime sucks, we might as well like make it suck

1632
02:50:57,860 --> 02:50:59,620
in a funny way.

1633
02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:04,380
Didn't we just, didn't we talk about ghost stories like last week or, I feel like, God,

1634
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:07,580
time is just, time is just going in circles, time, it's cyclical.

1635
02:51:07,580 --> 02:51:09,260
There's no past, no present, no future.

1636
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:10,820
We're caught on an infinite loop.

1637
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:13,420
God, tell me something I don't know.

1638
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:15,820
I've become unstuck in time.

1639
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:19,500
Uh, hey, that was the last voicemail.

1640
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:22,660
Yay, we did it.

1641
02:51:22,660 --> 02:51:23,660
We made it.

1642
02:51:23,660 --> 02:51:24,940
Um, how long have we been gone?

1643
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:26,700
What was it, like three hours?

1644
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:29,220
Yeah, a little bit under three hours.

1645
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:30,980
Have fun editing.

1646
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:32,540
Oh wait, you guys don't edit this shit.

1647
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:36,300
Fuck you, yeah, fuck you, Eleazar sucker.

1648
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:44,740
Um, well, shit, any final, any closing thoughts before we shuffle off this mortal coil?

Did I learn to say it right?

1653
02:51:51,940 --> 02:51:53,780
Yes, you said it right that time.

1654
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:57,260
Double cast spelled with a five and seven S.

1655
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:58,260
That's right.

1656
02:51:58,260 --> 02:51:59,260

The one just came out, the, the gamers tavern, uh, retrospective, uh, commentary track, uh,

1663
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:32,620
So we did it again.

1664
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,620
Haha.

1665
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:34,620
Uh, anything else?

1666
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:35,620
Well, what else?

1667
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:36,620
What's, what's left?

02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:40,220
Uh, big booby mommy milkers.

1669
02:52:40,220 --> 02:52:43,100
Don't fucking invest in Bitcoin, Jesus Christ.

1670
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:46,100
Um, I'd invest in Titcoin.

1671
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:47,100
No.

1672
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:48,100
Titcoin.

1673
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:50,300
That's the next cryptocurrency.

1674
02:52:50,300 --> 02:52:51,800
Let's go.

1675
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:53,300
Invest in Titcoin, everybody.

1676
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:54,300
All right.

1677
02:52:54,300 --> 02:52:55,300
That's it.

1678
02:52:55,300 --> 02:52:56,700
That's the, the, the show for this week.
