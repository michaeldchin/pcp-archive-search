00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Today we have a Ushipalooza for you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Ushalooza.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,300
Yep, an Ushalooza.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
These are brand new.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,600
So right here I have Marvel Series 2 packs.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,200
We have DC Comics.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,300
Ooh, very nice.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,600
And we have Disney packs, which how awesome is that?

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,700
Very cool.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,100
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,800
It is the day of the chosen battle destiny.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the big fight time every day.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm the best guy ever.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,300
And we've got Endless Jess.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,600
Yep, here for the one topic that I'm sure nobody else on the internet has ever talked about ever.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
I can't wait.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,900
Oh, Munchy is here.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm a prisoner.

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm an Alcatraz.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm a prisoner.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,100
I need to tone for my sins.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the only time I've been allowed to be on the internet because I'm a prisoner.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,600
I am a war criminal.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Check this out.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Munchy, Mumkey Jones.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh, fuck.

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Yo, Danny Phantom, he was just 14 when his parents built a very strange machine.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
He was assigned to view a world unseen.

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,700
He's going to catch them all because he's Danny Phantom.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,900
When it didn't quite work as folks, they just quit.

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,600
Then Danny took a look inside of it.

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,500
There's going to be a crash.

33
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,300
Everything can change.

34
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,800
His molecules get all rearranged.

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,500
Look at that shit.

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,600
Didn't Danny Phantom like shoot up the supermarket the other day?

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah, that's why I'm singing it.

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
He fucking shot up the supermarket like two days ago.

39
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,700
God damn.

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,200
Wait, what?

41
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,900
What happened?

42
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:36,700
Some guy who was inspired by the Danny Phantom character, Ember, and he has many fan fictions of him and Ember shooting up his high school just went and shot up a fucking supermarket and killed himself the other day.

43
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
What a fucking hero.

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,200
Okay, we'll have the podcast in celebration of his exploits the other day.

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,200
And lastly, we've got Mr. Tom Oliver is here.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, we picked a great day to have this discussion because Adam West died today.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So in his honor.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,500
What?

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh my God.

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Danny Phantom shot Adam West.

51
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah, it's really bad.

52
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,100
Jesus Christ.

53
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
He just went to the supermarket.

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,100
He wanted to get some avocados, but you know.

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,600
Is that for real?

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
He was 88.

57
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Like that's pretty old.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,100
Yeah.

59
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Oh man.

60
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Who's going to play Adam West on Family Guy?

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Seth Meharrow is.

62
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Oh my God.

63
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
The impersonation of Adam West, hooray.

64
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,600
Yes.

65
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,100
I think they wouldn't do an impersonation.

66
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
I think they would just retire the character.

67
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,400
Hard to say.

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
He's a pretty popular character.

69
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Well, we'll see.

70
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Any case, folks, our topic today is Marvel Baby versus D.C.

71
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
That's it.

72
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
That's the one.

73
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
What is this?

74
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
I don't know, dude.

75
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I really don't know what any of this means.

76
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I think it's a bunch of nerd shit.

77
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Is this like an episode of the panel cast, but not the panel cast?

78
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Pretty much.

79
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
This seems like a panel cast sort of.

80
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
I don't think most of us are that deep into comic book lore except for Jesse, of course.

81
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,700
I think most of us will be commenting from our experiences with perhaps the animated

82
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
universes and, of course, the new movies.

83
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,700
The one in particular contention today is that most of us were able to go see the new

84
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Wonder Woman movie.

85
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,700
With that, that really does change the game when it comes to this balance, especially

86
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
in the cinematic universe.

87
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
For reasons I'm sure we will get into.

88
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,700
I was just too much of a misogynist to go see it.

89
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
By misogynist, I mean poor.

90
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,700
It changed the game by not being completely terrible, so now the favor is totally the

91
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,700
balance is way in favor of DC now, because for once they made a not bad movie.

92
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,700
You know, it's really the prodigal son effect, you know?

93
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,700
They were so shit, and to make one that's actually good is like everyone falls in love.

94
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Munchie, what are you saying?

95
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
You know, I have to say this right off the bat.

96
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Gal Gadot killed two children while in the Israeli Defense Force, and she is a murderer.

97
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,700
She's not to be in the United States movie at the Hollywood business, and please boycott

98
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,700
this movie, please do not support Zionist propaganda, and please, please God, do not see

99
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Wonder Woman.

100
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Well, that's Wonder Woman, ladies and gentlemen.

101
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,700
Symbol of love and truth for all humanity.

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,700
I will say, of all of the DC movies so far, Wonder Woman is my second favorite to feature

103
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
the Wonder Woman character.

104
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Who's the first?

105
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Batman v Superman, dog?

106
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,700
That movie's the shit.

107
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Batman.

108
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Hell yeah.

109
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,700
You know, that movie's pretty good, but I mean, Suicide Squad really just blows it out

110
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
of the water in terms of sheer quality writing.

111
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,700
See, you take what you assume is my sarcasm, and then you return to the sarcasm.

112
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I wasn't joking.

113
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Batman v Superman is actually pretty great.

114
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Oh, well, looking for you, we've got the world's biggest fan of Batman v Superman,

115
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Endless Jess right here on the podcast to agree with you on that, right?

116
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Awesome.

117
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
We can agree together.

118
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,700
I mean, yeah, it's okay.

119
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
Yeah.

120
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Sure.

121
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
You're supposed to be the angry man, Jesse.

122
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,700
I forgot, Jesse is always irrationally angry about stuff.

123
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
That's correct.

124
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Well, okay, so I just wanted to say, overall, I thought the Wonder Woman movie was very good.

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,700
It was a little shorter than I expected it to be, but I found like the...

126
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Really?

127
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
It was like two hours and 20 minutes.

128
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Well, see, I didn't get that, but the various shots of her in the different locations,

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
thinking about what...

130
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,700
And then she eventually comes to that climactic moment at the end where she realizes it was

131
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
milk that she forgot to write in her grocery list.

132
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Oh, goddammit.

133
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
That was really good.

134
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
That was really an impressive character.

135
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Now, Nate, when you say you saw Wonder Woman, did you see this in a theater,

136
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,700
or did it pop up in your YouTube subscription feed?

137
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,700
I watched it yesterday in the theater, and today I watched it again on YouTube.

138
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
I preferred the YouTube version of the cinematic one.

139
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
It was pretty good, too.

140
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Those fan supercuts really do make movies just so much better, you know?

141
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
They really do.

142
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Okay, so let's just say, so the Wonder Woman movie was great, and there's mostly one reason

143
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,700
why, and it's because it wasn't a fucking abysmal, depressing piece of shit that made

144
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
me hate every character in it.

145
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Wonder Woman is by far the coolest superhero in like the DC Universe right now, because

146
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
she actually is a real hero.

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
She really wants to help people.

148
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
She's not going to cry.

149
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
She's not going to stand there.

150
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
While her father says, no, Clark, just let me die.

151
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Don't help anyone ever.

152
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Let everyone die.

153
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Stop my invincible son.

154
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Yeah, no.

155
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Just don't involve yourself in this situation.

156
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Watch me die, son.

157
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
That's what I want for you.

158
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Man, fuck that.

159
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,700
That movie was kind of okay, but that was like the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire

160
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
life.

161
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,700
But no, Diana is a fucking hero, and I love her, and she was the kickass, and she beat

162
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,700
up all the bad boys, and she shielded those bullets.

163
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
They had the cool moments.

164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
They had the slow down things.

165
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, so the movie was a lot of fun.

166
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Well, you know, it really is.

167
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I think it really is a lowered expectations thing, because I actually saw Guardian to

168
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,200
the Galaxy 2 last night, so I saw Guardians after I saw Wonder Woman.

169
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,700
I think most people probably saw it before, but like, I walked out of Wonder Woman thinking,

170
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
hey, that was a pretty good movie.

171
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,700
But then I walked out of Guardian to the Galaxy 2 thinking, no, it fucking wasn't.

172
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Yeah.

173
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,700
The Guardian to the Galaxy 2 is a good movie.

174
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Wonder Woman is a fucking okay movie.

175
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It's the best DC has done so far, but the worst Marvel movie is still better.

176
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't know.

177
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I really hated fucking Thor 1.

178
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
I thought it was an absolute garbage.

179
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I wouldn't go as far as saying Wonder Woman's worse than Thor 2.

180
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
No, nothing is worse than Thor 2.

181
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
You're all right.

182
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
I take it back.

183
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
You know what?

184
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I will totally grant you that.

185
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
I haven't seen either of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, but I hear they're great,

186
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
and I believe them.

187
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
And Wonder Woman, I definitely did not like love it.

188
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,700
I thought that especially the male lead guy was, he was capable, and he was fine,

189
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
and he was cool, and he fucked, you know, Diana, so that was cool.

190
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
But he was kind of boring.

191
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,700
And then it felt so, I don't know if Marvel does this really consistently,

192
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,700
but like the whole crew there was so like, uh, milk toast.

193
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,700
Like they had like one character trait each, and they're just like, yeah, we're going to go on a super quest.

194
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I would say they didn't have a character trait each.

195
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
And none of them had any characters.

196
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Well, I mean, the Indian guy was Indian, and the one guy who was scared of stuff was scared of stuff.

197
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
The dude with the fez was okay.

198
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I liked all the characters.

199
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I thought they were all cool and likable, and like I liked the little bond of friendship they all had.

200
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I liked the guy who wanted to talk.

201
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,700
It was weird how like the Scottish guy had this arc of like he's afraid to pull the trigger,

202
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
but he didn't actually ever get to pull the trigger.

203
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
He never took the shot.

204
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
It's like a literal Chekhov's gun that never went off.

205
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
I felt like that was like literal cut content.

206
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Like all the signs were there to resolve that, and then they just didn't do it.

207
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
So it was really bizarre.

208
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
That's the DLC that's going to come out two months later.

209
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Exactly, exactly.

210
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
And then you see some paths.

211
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah, the fuck it.

212
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,700
By the way, for context, for my enjoyment of, I've only seen the movies, and in fact, I hate comic books.

213
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm not only have I haven't seen any comic books in my redness.

214
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
I don't like them.

215
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
And I don't like superheroes.

216
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I don't like Marvel.

217
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
I don't like DC.

218
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,700
But I like, I thought the movies were pretty good because they were movies.

219
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,700
I'm in the position where I'll read an anime book because it's in black and white.

220
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,700
But when you pick up a colorful comic, it does something to my pea-sized brain where I can't really

221
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
function and understand what the fuck is happening.

222
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Exactly, exactly.

223
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
I just can't read it.

224
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
That's odd.

225
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm a legitimate issue now because I don't get it.

226
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I read a lot of mangoes.

227
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
I feel like most people are the opposite way.

228
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
That the black and white is a turn-off and they like the color better.

229
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I know Jesse would argue that he misses color in a great way when he reads mango.

230
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
There's just too many colors.

231
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
It just overloads your brain.

232
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,700
There's too many things to keep track of.

233
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
There's too many colors.

234
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
When you look at a beautiful painting with a ton of different colors, you just get too overwhelmed.

235
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I want to have black and white only contrast, no hues whatsoever.

236
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Crush the blacks and whites.

237
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
There's just too much information, you know, Mumki?

238
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
There's just too much information.

239
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,700
I mean, he might be being sarcastic, but I actually feel that way.

240
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Okay, fair enough.

241
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Yeah, me too.

242
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Well, okay, but let's get back to the point here.

243
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Marvel vs. DC here, okay?

244
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,700
So, Jesse's the foremost expert on this.

245
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
So, Jesse, why don't you just give us your overall impression here?

246
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I mean, you're coming from the comic book world a lot, but then of course you've seen probably more of the films than any of us.

247
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,700
So, where do you lie on this issue?

248
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Yeah, the same place that everyone else lies on it.

249
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,700
I can't explain it in any way that's new or exciting to people.

250
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
The DC movies are just a clusterfuck.

251
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,700
They tried to introduce too much too fast and they're kind of dark and miserable,

252
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,700
whereas the Marvel movies are like actual fun superhero movies.

253
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
And that's it.

254
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
That's the whole thing.

255
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Really, this is like a 10-minute podcast.

256
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I think the way we can go through these is each one of us, you know, from both Marvel and DC,

257
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
we say, what's our favorite movie and what's our least favorite,

258
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
and then we can, that's a good excuse to talk about why we feel these ways.

259
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Okay, sure.

260
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
That's true.

261
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Well, it's ironic because, I mean, the whole, I mean, that's the complaint is what I just said,

262
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,700
is that the Marvel movies are actually superhero movies and the DC movies have been sort of miserable

263
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,700
and monotonous and tedious and shitty and DC doesn't seem to know what they're doing.

264
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
That's the movie side of it.

265
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,700
When it comes to the comic book side of it, it's literally the opposite.

266
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
The DC comics are all great and fun and everyone loves them.

267
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,700
And Marvel comics right now are all miserable and shitty and the clusterfuck and everyone hates them.

268
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,700
So it's weird that, like, they're both equally good and equally shit,

269
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,700
but they can only be good or shit at one thing at a time, it seems like.

270
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Well, I feel like the reason that this has happened, at least in the cinematic movie,

271
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I have no idea what Marvel's doing with their comics right now.

272
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
It's other than, like, being awful.

273
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,700
But I think it's just because, like, they're trying to capture the lightning in a bottle of their first successes, respectively, right?

274
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Because, like, Marvel Studios' first, like, movie was Iron Man.

275
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,700
And Iron Man was a fun, light-hearted, kind of, like, you know, it was a good interpretation of a comic.

276
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
It's not as light-hearted as you might be remembering it being.

277
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
He spends a lot of the time in an ISIS cave.

278
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Well, that's-

279
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I'm a light-hearted.

280
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
There's-

281
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
I'm not, like, the character is very much like-

282
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
The movie makes a very favorable depiction of ISIS.

283
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Yeah.

284
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
They come out as the heroes.

285
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh, they're the real stars of that movie.

286
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
Yeah.

287
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,700
But, like, all of the movies that came out after Iron Man, I think very much are trying to capture, like, the underlying tone of Iron Man of, like-

288
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Sure.

289
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
This, like, is a serious story.

290
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
It's, like, a very comic book-y story, but, like, the characters are fun.

291
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,700
There's a fun, kind of, just, like, overall tone of the movies.

292
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Whereas, DC's big thing was the Dark Knight trilogy.

293
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Right.

294
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:45,700
That wasn't even so, like, as- I don't know if this is just me, but I felt like the Dark Knight trilogy, as it went on, became less Batman movies and more like Christopher Nolan movies.

295
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
That's true.

296
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,700
They've been- I felt they became more disconnected from the canon as they got darker and he took more liberties with the character and all that kind of stuff.

297
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Which was fun.

298
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
They were still fun movies.

299
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,700
But it was- you can definitely tell that when they came up with Man of Steel, they're like,

300
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Okay, we're gonna make the Dark Knight Superman.

301
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
That's right.

302
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
And they've been running with that ever since, really.

303
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Except maybe for Wonder Woman because I haven't seen it because I'm just- I hate women that much.

304
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
But, um...

305
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
No, you're right, Tom.

306
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:16,700
The Dark Knight trilogy is the worst thing that ever happened to the DC cinematic universe because they're all trying to do that again,

307
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,700
but they're failing because they're not Christopher Nolan.

308
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
They finally realized, though, with Wonder Woman.

309
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Or at least it seems that way.

310
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
They're moving in the right direction at last.

311
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,700
They understand that that's not what you want to do, especially with a character like Wonder Woman.

312
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
That they did what, like, guys like the Red Letter Media guys have been talking about for a long time,

313
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,700
of, like, no one knows who the fuck Wonder Woman is or anything about her or, like, any of her origin.

314
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
No one fucking knows.

315
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
So now is the time to, like, set all that shit up.

316
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Yeah, that's part of what I've wanted to say about Wonder Woman, I guess.

317
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
Is that, I mean, I've seen everyone praising the movie.

318
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,700
And everyone's praising it from either a movie fan's perspective or from, like, a feminist perspective or, you know, whatever.

319
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,700
But I've seen very few people talking about the movie from a comic book fan's perspective.

320
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,700
More specifically, my perspective, which is the only one that matters.

321
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Right.

322
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Which is that Wonder Woman is a shit character and always has been and I've always hated her because she makes no sense.

323
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,700
And anyone who says they're a fan of Wonder Woman prior to this movie was a big fat fucking wire.

324
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Right, for sure.

325
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Nobody, the character, it just isn't, like, relatable.

326
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Her origin doesn't make any sense.

327
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
She's, like, made from-

328
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
She's literally not human, she's not even human.

329
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Yeah, like, nobody in the world, and I think even now, even still after the movie, nobody can tell you what Wonder Woman's powers are because nobody knows.

330
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Dude, what were those, like, weird blasts or something she can do?

331
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
I don't know, they never talked about it, she just does it sometimes.

332
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
She's a god or something?

333
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
I don't know.

334
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Can anyone in the world answer me this?

335
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,700
And don't, because it's rhetorical, because I know you can't.

336
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Is Wonder Woman bulletproof?

337
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
If she hits it with her wrist.

338
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Yeah, I mean, I would say no.

339
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Because Wonder Woman, I mean, they portray her as being as strong and as invulnerable as, like, a Superman.

340
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Like, she can get hit by Doomsday in the face and she can get up and be fine from it.

341
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,700
But she needs wrist gauntlets to block bullets.

342
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
If she was really as strong as Superman, she wouldn't need those.

343
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,700
So, just, everything about the character makes no sense, but that's what I liked about the movie, is that they actually managed to somehow succeed.

344
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:29,700
In making Diana, as opposed to Wonder Woman, an actual fucking character that I can kind of relate to and see where she's coming from.

345
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
So that, I think that was the biggest strength of the movie.

346
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Diana?

347
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I think the worst parts of the movie, sorry, but the interruption.

348
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
No, go ahead, go ahead.

349
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I think the parts where the movie was the weakest or faulted were actually the more superhero tropey parts.

350
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Like, how she has to have a big superhero battle at the end with Aries that made no sense and was totally unnecessary.

351
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Like, the whole point of the movie is that Wonder Woman is realizing that there's not like a turn off switch for the evil in the hearts of men.

352
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,700
She's like, sort of losing hope and that's losing hope in the idea of fighting.

353
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
She's learning about mercy and love.

354
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,700
That's why she hasn't fought for like 100 years by the time Batman v Superman happens.

355
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Like, that's the plot of the movie.

356
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,700
They could have done that without a big superhero god battle.

357
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,700
That was totally like counterintuitive to the whole point of the film.

358
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Yeah, it was a little weird.

359
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Like, yeah, oh, there's nuance.

360
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
I killed the guy and it should still happening.

361
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
You didn't kill the god of war.

362
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
It's me, the god of war.

363
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
I make war happen.

364
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Kill me and it'll stop.

365
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm the god of war.

366
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
But then she does and it doesn't stop.

367
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Really, there really should have just been no Aries.

368
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
That would have been the right way to go.

369
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Does it make sense?

370
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Are they implying that World War One was actually caused by Aries?

371
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Why was he there?

372
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Like, he's there to make it like a little bit worse.

373
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Yeah, like he says, he says like,

374
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I didn't put evil and fear in the hearts of men.

375
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
I didn't start this war.

376
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I just, you know, tell them to make bombs and gases and make it worse because I'm an asshole.

377
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
And it's like, okay.

378
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
That could have just been a guy.

379
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
That could have just been the actual general.

380
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Yeah, sure.

381
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Yeah, that was dumb and, yeah, as you said, was kind of counterintuitive to the point of the movie

382
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
and just served to let there be a battle at the end.

383
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,700
By the way, I wanted to say that, like, that British dude as the Bat-

384
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Spoilers, by the way, fuck you.

385
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
You know, the British-

386
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
He got shots, Tom.

387
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
He's so jarring.

388
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,700
The guy with the mustache being Aries at the end.

389
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Like, you know that shot where like it shows like his origin and like we find out that he's the guy

390
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
where he gets like smote down by zoos.

391
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,700
He's down like in the Hades dungeon and he still has the gay ass retarded mustache.

392
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
It's the goddamn British fucking mustache.

393
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
What the fuck?

394
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
The God of War has been wearing for like thousands of years.

395
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
It's like, dude.

396
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
I thought he was in disguise, but no, that's how the God of War actually looks.

397
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
Little weasel face to mustache.

398
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
And it's like, fuck.

399
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,700
And his motivations don't make any sense because like at first Diana thinks, well, he's Aries.

400
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
He creates war because he loves war.

401
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
He's the God of War.

402
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
He thrives on war.

403
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
That makes sense.

404
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,700
But then she meets Aries and he's like, oh no, that's not it.

405
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I just hate humans and I want them to all be destroyed because I hate zoos.

406
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,700
But it's like, wouldn't him just liking war make way more sense?

407
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
He's the God of War.

408
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Like, how do you mess up that?

409
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
That's a weird thing.

410
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I know he's the God of Truth.

411
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Jesse, God of Truth.

412
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
That doesn't make no sense.

413
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
No, he's not.

414
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
He's the God of War.

415
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
That's a lie.

416
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
I think that is a lie.

417
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I was confused.

418
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
And the ancient Greeks always said, I have three gods.

419
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
One for lies, one for truth, and one for wisdom.

420
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
And the wisdom.

421
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
And the wisdom.

422
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
And the wisdom.

423
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,700
And then, so like, he's fighting Wonder Woman and he's like, fine, then I'll just destroy

424
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
humanity myself.

425
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
If that's what you wanted to do, why weren't you doing that before?

426
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,200
He apparently wants to destroy humanity through war, even though he's just as strong as a

427
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,700
God and he could have done it at any point by just beating people up.

428
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
You know what?

429
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Wonder Woman's a really shitty movie.

430
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
And you know what?

431
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
All the DC movies are shit.

432
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,700
I take back anything good that anyone has said about Wonder Woman.

433
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,700
You know, I totally, I usually hate this, but I'm definitely one of these guys liking

434
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
the movie a lot more because it's just such a change of pace.

435
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Yeah, I mean, that's my point.

436
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,220
It's just that all of the, a lot of the movie was stupid and totally fell apart at the end

437
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,700
and didn't make any sense.

438
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,780
But the reason that you can still sort of forgive it, at least for me, and say, well, it was

439
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,160
still a pretty good movie, is because as a comic book fan, at least they made Diana good.

440
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,000
She was, God, her naivete and her like sincere desire to do good for the world and her like

441
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,660
steadfast belief that like, I'm an Amazon, what we do is we help people, we save the

442
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
world.

443
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
That's what I'm all about.

444
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
Just so, so good.

445
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Yeah.

446
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,000
And I actually found myself relating to her a little bit, a character who I have never

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,120
been able to relate to at all before because she's been weird and obtuse and hard to understand

448
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,240
and hard to grasp.

449
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,980
But I really could relate to her frustration at realizing that human beings are just bad

450
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,500
and broken and most of them will just do horrible things for no fucking reason.

451
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,140
No, Jesse, you've missed the end point where she realizes that she's going to keep fighting

452
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,140
because she can still help, she can make a difference.

453
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
That's wrong.

454
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,460
Where is the Amazon island thing?

455
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Where is that?

456
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Munchy, that's not important.

457
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Don't worry about it.

458
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,980
It was like off the coast of that German base, but it was like hidden in a mystic aura.

459
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,680
I, yeah, so like in the Mediterranean?

460
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,320
It certainly wasn't in Amazon, I don't think.

461
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,280
Did she, did she, well it's not in the Amazon, yeah.

462
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,480
Is that, is her of accent Gal Gadot, is she Israeli?

463
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Is that what her accent is?

464
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,160
Yeah, she killed two fucking children in the Israeli defense force, you fucking faggot.

465
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Well they were probably asking for it, Munchy, did you ever think about that?

466
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,160
They, we've got to get our land back.

467
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,520
That was an attack force.

468
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,020
Did anybody else feel like Wonder Woman up until the dog shit ending was, it was like

469
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
watching a Marvel movie?

470
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,780
I felt like I was at a Marvel movie and then they had to force their DC tropes into the

471
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
end fight.

472
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
It was really desaturated and that was annoying to me.

473
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Not because I'm against the grimy ascetic, which I am, but I just love saturation so

474
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,260
much and I just feed off that saturation.

475
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,580
Munchy just saying too many colors are a bad thing.

476
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,020
I think he was making fun of me.

477
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,900
Yeah, I was making fun of Monkey, my favorite thing to do.

478
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,280
Yeah, Wonder Woman's outfit is just a little desaturated and it's like, okay, it's like

479
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,080
they're afraid to go full color mode with these costumes and shit, which I guess I understand

480
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,280
because they look silly, but whatever.

481
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah, let's talk about the comedy in this movie because I was actually pretty on board

482
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,800
with most of what they were doing.

483
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,280
We're totally diverging, we're going into this movie deep, but hey fuck it.

484
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Were there jokes?

485
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I don't remember any.

486
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,940
Dude, how could you forget Munchy?

487
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,460
How could you forget the epic joke where she's looking at his penis and she's like, what

488
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
is that?

489
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,180
And he's like, uh, uh, uh, oh my watch, it's a watch.

490
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,140
How could you forget that all the jokes landed, I thought the movie was pretty funny, none

491
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,980
of the jokes failed to make me chuckle.

492
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,260
And even things that weren't outright jokes, they were just sort of humorous, like when

493
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,280
he wraps her truth thing around his wrist to prove that he's telling the truth.

494
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,520
It's a lighthearted kind of fun thing, it's not necessarily a joke, but I still got a

495
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
little chuckle on it.

496
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,000
I really had the fear going into the movie that all of the humor would be like, oh, the

497
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,400
world of men is so regressive, here's men and I don't like them, which to me is the

498
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,880
opposite of what Wonder Woman should be, shouldn't the whole point of her be that she's enamored

499
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,740
with the world of men and like enamored with sexes living together because she's been sheltered

500
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,900
from it her whole life.

501
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,140
She shouldn't be like walking around like thinking she's above it all.

502
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,840
Like I was really, I really felt like this movie would come out and just be like a really

503
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,260
bull dyke-y like fuck all men movie.

504
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:07,660
And it really wasn't like, there's, there's no feminist agenda shit in the movie at all

505
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
already.

506
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,460
I fucking loved just how like it was all about just like humanity, brotherhood, you

507
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,160
know, men, women, everybody, we're all in this shit together, don't fucking worry about

508
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
it.

509
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah, like she learns about like the world of men and she's like, yeah, cool, I've never

510
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,400
seen a man before, your penis is really big, is that the biggest penis?

511
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
And he's like, yep, it sure is.

512
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,760
And she's like, wow, cool, I think that's cool, I am a girl, let's sleep together and

513
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,120
cuddle on my boat.

514
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,360
And he's like, okay, and then she has ice cream and she's like, well, this is just

515
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,520
the bee's knees right here.

516
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,660
And they had the opportunity to make the cheapest, dumbest, pro-feminism joke possible when

517
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,260
he says, Chris Pine says, oh, Wonder Woman, you can't go in there, that's no man's land.

518
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,220
I thought she was going to say, oh, no man.

519
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,980
I could feel it coming and thank God they didn't say it.

520
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,660
They didn't do it, it's like they set us up to expect it and then they subverted it

521
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,140
and it was really, it was beautiful, it was wonderful, I might say.

522
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,460
You know, I did want to say, I have to give the movie a couple of minus points for never

523
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,600
having the line that really was, who was that wonderful woman just now?

524
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,320
I don't know, I'm really wondering about her, I'd really like to know.

525
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Wonder Woman, we serve like a Wonder Woman.

526
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Yeah, yeah, we got, are we some kind of Wonder Woman?

527
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Holy shit, it's Batman versus Superman, the dawn of justice.

528
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
I remember that line.

529
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
That was the greatest one.

530
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,180
God, okay, so we're pretty much all in agreement that this movie was great and, well okay,

531
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,940
not great, but it was definitely a positive move for DC, the best they've done in their

532
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,420
whole cinematic universe yet and hopefully they'll continue this way and they won't

533
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,580
fuck it up anymore, they'll just improve from here.

534
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,020
Alright, one last thing to say about Wonder Woman, I hate Nazis but not the kind you're

535
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
thinking about.

536
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Alright, so here's the reason I like Wonder Woman.

537
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
There were no Nazis in World War I and not World War II.

538
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
I hate World War II, it's fucking played out and it's gay.

539
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Yeah.

540
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,640
World War I is sick as fuck, a ton of people died, a lot of people got their fucking asses

541
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,400
blown up because they were stupid, they didn't realize that guns are real and they thought

542
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
that guns were fake and they weren't real.

543
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
That's actually true.

544
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,360
World War II is cooler than God and God is Godder than God and that's my review of

545
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,180
World War I, it's pretty good, Wonder Woman saved World War I, it was a shitty movie before

546
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,420
then and World War I got a shitty review on Ron Tomatoes because it didn't have a lot

547
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,260
of humor, it was pretty desaturated, but then Wonder Woman came in the last couple minutes

548
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,980
of the movie and it saved World War I and I like World War I, Dr. Poison is my waifu

549
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,900
because World War I is cool.

550
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:00,060
My question is, how did Gal Gadot manage to make every single scene sexy as fuck?

551
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,080
My question is, how did Gal Gadot manage to kill two children rather than your family?

552
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,120
I mean, one's bad enough, but you get two in there.

553
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Oh no.

554
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,360
Munchy, please, that poor woman, she suffered enough.

555
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,560
Just judging by the way she looks, I would probably jerk off to footage of her killing

556
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
those children.

557
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Oh no.

558
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah, me too.

559
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,320
Are you jerking off to the kids dying under the woman?

560
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
You know, it's a healthy mixture.

561
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,400
A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

562
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,580
So, okay, let's do what Munchy was saying, I mean, Munchy was saying, and let's all talk

563
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,420
about maybe some of our other favorites or least favorite ones, just to get the sense

564
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,020
of how this whole thing's panning out.

565
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,980
Munchy, why don't you tell us some of yours?

566
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,660
Is your favorite Guardians of the Galaxy 2, is that what you were saying?

567
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,580
No, but I did say, I do think that's better than Guardians 1 for sure, although they're

568
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,980
both like nine out of ten stars in my book.

569
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,900
I want to go back to my opinion that Batman vs. Superman is fucking awesome.

570
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,400
And you were complaining like, oh, the problem with DC is it's all sad and depressing.

571
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,320
I'm like, nigga, do you know who you're talking to right now?

572
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,840
You know this Mr. Monkey Jones?

573
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,080
He's into that kind of shit, baby.

574
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,840
I want to go feel like a piece of shit watching Batman mope around and be all sad, and Superman

575
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,720
stand there in a courthouse while it blows up and everybody fucking dies.

576
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,440
That's my kind of movie.

577
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,280
So I had a great time at the theater, I saw that one twice, and I thought it fucking kicked

578
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
ass.

579
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Dope dog.

580
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Dope dog.

581
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,100
What's your least favorite, though?

582
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Suicide Squad.

583
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I would rather kill myself than watch it.

584
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Suicide Squad's cool, dude.

585
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,340
I'd rather have to be part of a Suicide Squad.

586
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Not a joke.

587
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Suicide Squad's cool.

588
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Horrible.

589
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
It's fucking cool.

590
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
It's funny.

591
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
I don't know, dude.

592
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Suicide Squad is one of the greatest films I've made.

593
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
It's awesome.

594
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, Wonder Woman is getting credit for being a more lighthearted DC movie, but Suicide Squad

595
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,780
was lighthearted, and that sucked a lot.

596
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Yeah.

597
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,400
The United States Marines embodying one character, the greatest show of, like, a love letter

598
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,080
to all of our armed forces, Rick Flag, the greatest DC character of all time, Rick Flag.

599
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,760
He's a Marine, he's from America, he's sort of gruff, but he's got a heart of gold, Rick

600
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Flag, United States Marine.

601
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
Doesn't he betray his platoon, because he wants to fuck a witch?

602
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,760
United States Marine, Rick Flag, American, Carnate, Fights for Liberty, American Flag,

603
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Rick Flag.

604
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Same thing.

605
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,340
It's like the American flag, it was an extra G. Rick Flag, American Patriot, Patriotism

606
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:36,540
Incarnate, Rick Flag, Fighting Batman, fuck Batman, Batman's not American, he's Israeli,

607
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,900
Gal Gadot killed two children while in the Israeli Defense Force.

608
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,780
Rick Flag tried to save those children.

609
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,020
Rick Flag, American Citizen.

610
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,620
I think I can already see the comments on this episode.

611
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,380
They're going to say, Munchy was good.

612
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Good job, Munch.

613
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
Yeah.

614
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Thank you.

615
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,840
I try my hardest.

616
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
Everybody, forget 1-1-1, post a good job, Munch, in the comments.

617
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah.

618
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Good job.

619
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,920
You know, none of these guys really touched on the main issue at hand, except for good

620
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
old Munchy.

621
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
Bring it home once again.

622
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,640
Good old Munchy reminding us all that Gal Gadot killed two children in the Israeli Defense

623
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Force.

624
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,800
It bears repeating, dude, it bears repeating.

625
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,200
Welcome to the Gal Gadot Killed Two Children in the Israeli Defense Force podcast episode

626
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
1.

627
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
What about you, Jesse?

628
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,460
Jesse, what's your favorite Marvel movie?

629
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,660
Oh, yeah, Jesse, go ahead.

630
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,540
Well, you know, it's not part of the Marvel universe, but I still have a soft spot for

631
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,900
old Spider-Man 2, a true classic.

632
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
That's cheating.

633
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
It's everybody's favorite.

634
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
It's cheating.

635
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
I know it's cheating.

636
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
I'm sorry.

637
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
There's something deeply wrong with me.

638
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,600
You know, I think Iron Man is like a really rewatchable, just a classic film.

639
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,960
The First Avengers is great, but you know, I really think walking out of Guardians 2

640
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,640
last night, I just felt like, wow, they fucking did it.

641
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,760
It was like the best movie ever.

642
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
The best movie ever.

643
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,640
I've never seen that shit.

644
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I saw Guardians 2 with Digi, and when the movie was over, it wasn't even like a, yeah,

645
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
that movie ruled.

646
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,100
It was like a, huh, how in the fuck did they make such a good movie?

647
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Yeah.

648
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,340
It really boggles the mind, especially since the first one was so good, and the second

649
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,220
one is even better.

650
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,180
Do you agree with the idea of Guardians being like this generation's Star Wars trilogy?

651
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,020
I've not heard that before, but yes.

652
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Yeah.

653
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Yeah, I feel the same way.

654
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,580
Yeah, I mean those movies are ironic considering there's a Star Wars trilogy coming out.

655
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,440
I have a Russell Wall, it's the decayed pictures of Russell in my room.

656
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,800
I really like Kurt Russell, I really like him.

657
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I like how that implies that the new Star Wars movies that are coming out are no generation

658
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,920
Star Wars trilogy.

659
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,440
Even the prequels were at least some generation Star Wars.

660
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,160
Well, I mean the idea of it being a good thing.

661
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,240
Yeah, I mean it's very imaginative, very excited, and you don't even really have to

662
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
know anything.

663
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,740
You don't even have to be up to date on the Marvel universe continuity at all.

664
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,380
The movies stand on their own as their own series.

665
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
That is good.

666
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Yeah.

667
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
It's a good strength.

668
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,180
And how about your least favorite, though?

669
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,980
I mean Thor 2 is not, like it's almost like a meme that everyone hates Thor 2, but it's

670
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,620
just like of all the Marvel movies I've seen, I remember nothing about Thor 2.

671
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,780
It's the most forgettable thing that I've ever seen if I've seen it.

672
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,760
I don't even remember, that's how forgettable it is.

673
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,840
I remember one shot where Loki becomes Captain America, and then also I guess Loki killed

674
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,280
Odin at the end, and that's it, and everything else is out of my mind.

675
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,880
Oh yeah, I wonder if that has been like dropped, or if it still matters, because no one remembers

676
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
it.

677
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
No idea.

678
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,080
It'll probably come up in the next one.

679
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,800
My favorite movie is Iron Man 2, and my least favorite is Guardians of the Galaxy Breakout

680
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,780
Mission, the rather-replaced Hollywood Tower of Terror at Disneyland, California Adventure.

681
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,500
What?

682
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,460
That sounds amazing.

683
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
What is happening?

684
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,620
We need to inject this podcast with some juice, brother.

685
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,220
I need to bring in some controversial opinions for everybody to argue with.

686
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,620
I think Tony Stark is a shitty character, the most boring thing to ever happen to the Marvel

687
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
Universe.

688
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:43,920
Now see here, sir, you've crossed the line before, but this time, you can't possibly

689
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
go back.

690
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Comic books!

691
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Oh god.

692
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Comic books!

693
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
And no!

694
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
So you guys excited for the new Spider-Man movie that's coming out?

695
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
No!

696
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
That just looked pretty good.

697
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
I'm super hyped for that.

698
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
I literally like it.

699
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Um, I think it looks like shit, actually, and I'm not excited about it, but it does look

700
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
pretty good.

701
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I'm super hyped for that.

702
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I literally like it.

703
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,720
Um, I think it looks like shit, actually, and I'm not excited for it at all.

704
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,020
That's something we can talk about.

705
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,460
I've never, I've, I never would have imagined I could be this unexcited for a Spider-Man

706
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
movie.

707
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Yeah?

708
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,340
I don't care about seeing Spider-Man be a fucking, a 14-year-old baby in high school.

709
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
I've seen it before.

710
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,340
I can understand that perspective for sure.

711
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,380
Do you ever think this looks better than Amazing Spider-Man 2?

712
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,460
Oh no, it looks a thousand times better than Amazing Spider-Man 2.

713
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
You know what?

714
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,120
My least favorite Marvel movie is Amazing Spider-Man 1, so bad I didn't even see the

715
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
second one.

716
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,620
Those movies are fucking shit.

717
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
They're terrible.

718
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,080
That's not that kind of Marvel movie, though, because it was like, fucking Peter Parker

719
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,240
in those movies is like a weird school shooter on a skateboard, fucking, he's, he's not

720
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
even like a nerd.

721
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,280
He's just like a fucking weirdo.

722
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,680
He like, I don't like him.

723
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,600
I don't, I'm not, I'm not a fan.

724
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,240
And also those movies were made like while the Marvel Universe movies were going on,

725
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,660
but they still couldn't get them in there, so like what was the fucking point?

726
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,180
To make Sony money.

727
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Just Sony to make money.

728
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,860
Did you guys hear that Sony was trying to make their own Spider-Man cinematic universe

729
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,020
and they even had plans for like fucking Aunt May was going to have her own movie?

730
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
What?

731
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
Yeah.

732
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Well no, they're still doing that.

733
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
What's that movie called?

734
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
Titanum.

735
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Titanum's coming out.

736
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,340
Yeah, she's telling the story of how she met Uncle Ben on an ill-fated ship back in

737
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
1912.

738
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,800
No, Aunt May is like 30 now for some reason.

739
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,200
Yeah, but yeah, but that's not part of the Sony cinematic universe.

740
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
We're talking, that's Marvel.

741
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
You know, you got a good point.

742
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,600
No, I'm telling you, like they were, they said that was like amazing Spider-Man 2, they

743
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,400
were going to, amazing Spider-Man 2 was meant to be their Batman v Superman, where they

744
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,000
launch it off into eight different movies.

745
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,200
You're going to have a Sinister Six movie, Aunt May, they're still doing Venom, Venom's

746
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,160
coming out like next year or something, isn't it?

747
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,680
But I don't think it's going to be related.

748
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,940
It's actually going to be good though, I think.

749
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,020
Because as soon as they got rid of Andrew Garfield, I think that whole universe was

750
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
going to be gone.

751
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,620
Well, no, because they just announced a little while ago, they announced who's playing Venom.

752
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,020
Yeah, but that's not part of, I'm saying it's part of a contained universe.

753
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Dude, that's going to be great.

754
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
That's Bane.

755
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,020
What's his fucking name?

756
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
I can't remember his name.

757
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
Tom Hardy.

758
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Tom Hardy's playing fucking Venom?

759
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Yeah, man.

760
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
What?

761
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
Cool.

762
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
It is cool.

763
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,220
It's not a bad casting choice, I'm not going to lie, but no, that's like Sony is, I guess

764
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,520
like the weird thing is that like they have the rights to all the Spider-Man characters.

765
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,240
So like they can't, all of their Spider-Man movies that they're going to make won't have

766
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,960
Spider-Man in it, but they don't have anything to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

767
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,880
It's their own Spider-Man, Sony Cinematic Universe minus Spider-Man himself.

768
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
I'm not making this up.

769
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
It is that stupid.

770
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Awesome.

771
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Yeah.

772
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,280
And so it's great and licensing deals are the best.

773
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,360
And it makes everything good as we can clearly see now because we have this Marvel Cinematic

774
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,900
Universe without Spider-Man and the X-Men because why would we need those?

775
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
You know, I mentioned this.

776
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Poor X-Men.

777
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
Poor X-Men.

778
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, the poor, the poor X-Men.

779
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
They all died.

780
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
They're all gone.

781
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
What about Logan?

782
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
I thought Logan was pretty fucking sick.

783
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
No, no.

784
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
That's, yeah, that's what I mean.

785
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,500
I mean, I mean, in the continuity of Logan, the X-Men are all dead.

786
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I was just kidding.

787
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,740
No, Logan was a great movie.

788
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Yeah.

789
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
And I, yeah, I forgot about that.

790
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,660
Logan, yeah, Logan was as good as Guardians 2.

791
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I think I might like them equally now that I think about Logan.

792
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,480
That's what's pissing me off about this Wonder Woman shit is people saying, oh, it's the

793
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,160
best superhero movie in 10 years when it's not even, it's the third best one this year.

794
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Yeah.

795
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Dude, that's not even close.

796
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
That's the feminist agenda in action.

797
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
They got to say that.

798
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
They're trying to cover up the fact that Gal Gadot killed two children in the universe.

799
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
That's what feminism has always been about.

800
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,660
What the fuck?

801
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,800
Ever since the creation of feminism in like fucking 1917, it's all been about covering

802
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
up Gal Gadot's murders.

803
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,820
So you're saying that feminism is the next scheme by Ares to cause strife and horror

804
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
in the world?

805
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
It does cause it.

806
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,500
And Wonder Woman 2, 3, a.k.a. the third sequel, like the third first sequel, Ares is going

807
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:13,340
to come back and he's going to start a Neo-Gamergate, but this time like with the real people and

808
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
it's going to be great.

809
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,340
Looking forward to it.

810
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,120
Feminism has started the most bloody, the bloodiest war of all and that is the internal

811
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:27,080
war inside me as I struggle to decide how much of a cool feminist I truly want to be.

812
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
The bloodiest war of all.

813
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
The period war.

814
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Is that a period piece?

815
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Yeah.

816
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,600
It's a bloodiest war because women will be fighting in it.

817
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,360
Jess, since you actually read the comics, are there any comic storylines that you think

818
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,080
should be adapted into film that haven't been done so yet?

819
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Shit.

820
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Yeah.

821
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,780
A lot of them.

822
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,460
One of my favorite Wolverine stories, which they couldn't do now because the whole Wolverine

823
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,340
story is over, but it was like a Wolverine story where you just get introduced to him

824
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,540
as this woman's neighbor and she doesn't know anything about him but she gets kidnapped

825
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,620
and it takes him six issues to even pop his claws and then he just slaughters an entire

826
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,060
camp full of kidnappers and it's the coolest thing ever.

827
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,320
So there's tons of stories like with the X-Men and the Marvel Universe at large that you

828
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,680
could never do just because the film universes aren't connected, like there's a story where

829
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,920
Wolverine gets brainwashed by Hydra and kills everybody and has to fight all the superheroes

830
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,920
and it's the coolest story ever but they couldn't do it because yeah.

831
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,920
That's cool, bro.

832
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Why are we doing that?

833
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm sure there's a bunch of Batman stories that they could do except they only ever want

834
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,220
to do the Dark Knight Returns over and over again.

835
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,620
Honestly, I think Batman the Long Halloween would be fun to watch.

836
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,120
I really like those comics.

837
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,660
It's a great story because stories like that where you get to see Batman's entire rogues

838
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,220
gallery of villains over the course of a year in the Long Halloween or how cool would it

839
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:05,580
be to get a spooky director like Guillermo del Toro or something and do Arkham Asylum,

840
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,320
Haunted House on a Serious House on Earth or whatever.

841
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,560
Just the story of Batman being trapped in Arkham for a night and running into all of

842
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,000
his kooky villains and it's like a trippy scary, like a horror movie with Batman.

843
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,920
That would be a way cooler standalone Batman movie than anything they've done recently

844
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,760
and I think that's what they should focus on more in general is more standalone movies

845
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
because a lot of them get bogged down and kind of new.

846
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,200
They're kind of doing not new animated films but it's just it's not the same thing.

847
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,460
I really like Lego Mr. Freeze.

848
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,460
It should be Lego Batman movie.

849
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Oh shit.

850
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Wait, holy shit.

851
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,460
That's a good idea.

852
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Did that come out this year too?

853
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
There was a Lego Batman movie.

854
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
Yeah, it came out this year.

855
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,100
That was last year, I think, right?

856
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,660
No, that was February this year, dude.

857
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,540
Oh, so Wonder Woman is the fourth best superhero movie this year.

858
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Lego Batman was fucking awesome.

859
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Lego Batman was fucking sick as fuck, dude.

860
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Oh, shit.

861
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Yeah, does that count?

862
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Can we count?

863
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
Oh, of course it does.

864
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
I didn't even...

865
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Okay, okay.

866
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
I forgot all about that.

867
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I didn't even see that one.

868
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,940
Wonder Woman is the first one and I really like Mr. Freeze's level because there's ice

869
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
cream in it.

870
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,020
Nate, I hope you have a lot of questions on Twitter ready for this episode.

871
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,060
Oh, you know it, brother.

872
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Okay, that's actually...

873
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,580
We've been building this episode up amongst ourselves for months and it turns out we have

874
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,060
nothing to say on the subject.

875
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,260
Everything really is like super obvious, Marvel's better, DC still sucks but the comics are

876
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
good.

877
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
That's a good idea, Tom.

878
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,260
We should all put it to a vote.

879
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
There's five of us.

880
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,980
Hang on, hang on.

881
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Before we launch away, okay, are we decided that we're only talking about the cinematic

882
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
universe?

883
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Is that the whole...

884
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,980
We're talking about everything.

885
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Yeah, the comics.

886
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
No, okay.

887
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,260
Well, forget the comics because there is one area where DC is unparalleled, un-fucking-paralleled

888
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:53,220
and it is the animated universe, is the animated shows, fucking classic animated Batman, fucking

889
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:59,060
Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, the Superman fucking cartoon, all absolute gold,

890
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
all gold.

891
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,820
I hate Man of Steel so much because I grew up watching that animated Superman show and

892
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,940
to spit on that character so badly, just like maybe fucking livid, is the...

893
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Oh, god.

894
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
I think I did a video about that.

895
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,100
You guys don't like the Spider-Man cartoon where Drake Bell is the voice of Spider-Man?

896
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,140
You know, I really like the original Spider-Man from the early 90s and the X-Men.

897
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,700
The X-Men cartoon holds up.

898
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
It's really good.

899
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
It's really funny.

900
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,700
This one's for you, Morph.

901
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Yeah.

902
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
Marvel had good cartoons, too, but yeah.

903
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,260
The DC animated universe is like supreme and awesome and great.

904
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,820
I really love Batman and beyond.

905
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,820
I know that it's like kind of like the redheaded sketch, huh?

906
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
But it's so good.

907
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,420
Dude, Return of the Joker is one of the finest animated, you know, fucking comic book films

908
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
of all time.

909
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,620
There's just so much fucking, fucking good shit coming out of DC's animated show.

910
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
The killing joke.

911
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
I love the killing joke.

912
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
That was...

913
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
It was so good.

914
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Oh, dude.

915
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,620
No.

916
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
Okay.

917
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
No.

918
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
No.

919
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,020
I always wanted to watch Batgirl get fucked.

920
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
By Batman.

921
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
By Batman.

922
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Come on.

923
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,020
Her tits.

924
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Harry Strong sucks.

925
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Ouch, God.

926
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
I'm wearing my Brony shirt right now, as a matter of fact.

927
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
How dare you?

928
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
How dare you?

929
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,820
The fucking extended universe stuff, like related to Batman and Beyond.

930
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
I always bring this up.

931
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,820
It's like my favorite episode of any of that shit where...

932
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
I know.

933
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
I know what we're going.

934
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,820
It's great.

935
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,020
He's grown up more.

936
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,020
He's grown up from the Batman Beyond days, and he's looking around.

937
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,420
He's like, what's my deal?

938
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,820
Why am I fucking Batman?

939
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,620
And he does a bunch of research.

940
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,620
And here's the story of what Batman was like and why Batman's a real fucking hero.

941
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,020
It's the whole scene.

942
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,820
Here's it from Amanda Waller, like Batman's nemesis when they were young.

943
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,460
And they fucking talk about this one time where Ace was fucking going apeshit and was

944
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,420
destroying the city, and Batman's like, yo, I'll take care of her.

945
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,420
They're like, Bruce, but she has to be fucking killed.

946
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,620
And he's like, I'll fucking handle it.

947
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,820
Shut up, you gay ass bitches.

948
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,820
I'm on this shit.

949
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,420
And then he fucking storms in there and gets in and Ace, who can read minds and shit.

950
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,620
And she's, you know, fucking up the city.

951
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,020
Everyone's going to die.

952
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,220
And she's just like, hey, Batman, I can totally fucking read your thoughts.

953
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,820
And he's like, yeah, what of it?

954
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,620
And she's like, yeah, I know you're not going to kill me.

955
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,020
He's like, yeah, what of it, bitch?

956
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,420
And they just have the fucking heartwarming moments where they sit together and he's like,

957
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,420
yeah, I'm not going to hurt you.

958
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
We're just going to sit here.

959
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,620
I'm going to be with you while you're dying.

960
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,620
Because I know what it's like to lose your fucking childhood.

961
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,820
That is the greatest Batman moment of all time.

962
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
It's so fucking good.

963
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,820
Nothing beats it.

964
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Oh my God.

965
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,820
It's, yeah.

966
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,420
I mean, like, that's like the kind of like heart and like soul of these characters that

967
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
like defines them.

968
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,620
And yet it's so fucking missing in these, these DC movies.

969
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,020
It's just like, we're just going to have everyone be like really angry.

970
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,420
Well, that's why Justice League is going to save us, dude.

971
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,620
Justice League is going to fix all the problems in the DC universe.

972
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,620
Man.

973
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,620
I'm ready for it.

974
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
I'm so jealous of your optimism.

975
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,620
When I went to the movies yesterday, the Justice League trailer came on, I was like, okay,

976
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
time to get beer now.

977
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,020
It feels like DC can't stop making really obvious mistakes.

978
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:09,620
Like a couple years ago, Ben Affleck was going to write and direct his own Batman movie,

979
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,740
which would have been cool because he's actually a good writer and director and also a good

980
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,180
actor and he was actually really good as Batman.

981
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,820
Like he was the best part of that movie.

982
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Oh, for sure.

983
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,180
But now he's not directing it anymore and they're like rewriting the script.

984
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,460
And it's like, why would you do that?

985
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Why?

986
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,820
I think that like he was trying, but like, you know, the executive meddling was just

987
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,820
too much.

988
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,820
Studio interference fucked it.

989
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
Okay.

990
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,820
Well, here's a question then.

991
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,060
Like, do you think that the reason, because like, here's the thing.

992
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,740
We had Fox and Sony doing all these Marvel films for a while and they were okay.

993
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,020
They have like their hits and misses and then DC did their thing and they have their hits

994
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,380
and misses and they're missing more often than not.

995
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,300
But the reason Marvel's doing so good is because like there's like one guy ahead of

996
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,980
the show who's who's like in charge of everything.

997
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,220
And like, there's like a very like, cohesive vision for what the Marvel Cinematic Universe

998
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,220
should be.

999
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,220
I forget what the guy's name is because I'm stupid, but there's this one guy who's like

1000
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,720
that guy.

1001
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,220
He's in charge of the whole show.

1002
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:08,220
And like, I really feel like that like very clear sense of direction like one dude who's

1003
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,140
like knows his shit and can make it all happen is why Marvel's doing so well, because there's

1004
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,740
no there's no equivalent on the DC camp right now to keep any of this shit coherent or

1005
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,740
reign it in and like make those like executive in like someone to stop the corporate meddling

1006
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,980
is like, no, like we're going to make something good if you want your fucking money.

1007
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,980
So it's just like, I don't know, I feel like that's a huge part of why it's not just like,

1008
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,940
oh, Marvel understands it or Marvel has better characters or whatever.

1009
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,860
I think it's because like there's a very clear like power hierarchy in terms of how Marvel

1010
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,820
Studios is set up and you can make executive decisions like that that trickle down through

1011
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,820
the rest of the production, which like DC clearly doesn't have their equivalent at this

1012
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,420
point.

1013
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,620
And incidentally, I'm becoming aware that like most of the stuff I really love from

1014
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,300
DC was like a decade ago at least.

1015
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,060
So yeah, let's talk about the actual best DC movie Batman Returns where he fucking he

1016
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,780
fights the penguin and the penguin is gross.

1017
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,280
He like eats a bird eats raw fish, Michelle Piper is really hot in that movie.

1018
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,780
Everything is all weird and cookie because it's Tim Burton.

1019
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,900
He goes, I played this thinking city like a hop from hell and then fucking that movie

1020
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,900
is good.

1021
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
The end.

1022
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,140
This is a good movie.

1023
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,820
What about was it Batman and Robin?

1024
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
The greatest Batman.

1025
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
Oh, shit.

1026
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
That's a good one.

1027
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,220
How can we forget the best nipples on the suits?

1028
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,340
The fucking, hey man, even the Adam West Batman movie is pretty great.

1029
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:36,860
It is very, it's very, it's more comedy movie, but it's very funny that scene is trying to

1030
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,860
get rid of the bomb.

1031
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,140
He can't get rid of the bomb.

1032
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
The ducks are there.

1033
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,140
He doesn't want to hurt the baby ducks or the baby people.

1034
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,140
He just can't get rid of a bomb.

1035
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
That's great.

1036
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,140
Good movie.

1037
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,460
Tarot Tarot was such a cool ride.

1038
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,820
Why would they take it out and replace it with Guardians of the Galaxy?

1039
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
It's like not.

1040
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,820
I don't know, dude.

1041
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,140
Guardians of the Galaxy is even that popular.

1042
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,780
I mean, Tower of Terror is fucking iconic.

1043
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,420
When you go to California adventures, you have to go on the Tower of Terror because

1044
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,420
it's just so cool.

1045
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,420
You, you know, the Twilight Zone is such an interesting.

1046
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,500
Look, they decided that instead of just having a single Tower of Terror, they're going to

1047
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
terrorize everyone there by taking it away.

1048
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
You know what?

1049
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Speaking of Guardians of the Galaxy.

1050
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Right now.

1051
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,020
Again, let's talk about something that needs to die and I'm sick of it and I hate it more

1052
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,020
than anything in the world.

1053
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,020
Baby Groot.

1054
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,020
Yes.

1055
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020
Oh my God.

1056
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,020
Yeah.

1057
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,020
That too.

1058
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,020
Baby Groot was annoying.

1059
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,020
Yeah.

1060
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,060
And thank God that he is only a baby for that movie and won't be a baby again.

1061
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,060
Hopefully.

1062
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,060
Yeah.

1063
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,860
They really pushed the marketing on Baby Groot a lot and it got a little oversaturated.

1064
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,060
I don't see any minions vibes from it.

1065
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,060
Yeah.

1066
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh no.

1067
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,780
He didn't ruin any scene he was in at all.

1068
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,460
I mean, he worked in the movie, but just like the marketing and like the hype surrounding

1069
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,620
Baby Groot himself is pretty obnoxious.

1070
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,580
He was there for the normies.

1071
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,460
But yeah, I was going to say the post credit scenes need to die because Guardians of the

1072
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,700
Galaxy 2 had like seven post credit scenes and they were all completely worthless and

1073
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,740
didn't mean like, oh, here's a Captain Marvel thing maybe and here's a fucking, Stallone

1074
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,980
has his own crew now.

1075
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,900
And here's like teenager Groot and I'm like, they're doing something with Captain Marvel

1076
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,900
now.

1077
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,420
Well, like it annoyed me in particular with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 because the movie

1078
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,540
was so perfect and like every character had an arc and they all coalesced at the end.

1079
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,620
And there's like this really emotional moment and the movie ends on this like emotional

1080
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,180
point where it just like, you know, the close up on rocket and he's and he's crying and

1081
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,980
I'm like, wow, this really fucking touched me.

1082
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,540
I can't believe.

1083
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,100
And then there's like a bunch of fucking post credit scenes with like teenage Groot jacking

1084
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,860
off in his room and coming on Peter Quill's fucking face.

1085
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,260
And it's like really, you couldn't you couldn't just let it sit on that image of rocket being

1086
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,900
like all emotional like making me, you can't just make me, you can't just be content to

1087
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,940
let me feel something.

1088
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,500
You have to throw like teenager tree jizz in my face.

1089
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
They had to make me feel uncomfortable.

1090
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,580
I'm totally with you.

1091
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,620
I'm totally with you on that.

1092
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,780
That fucking sucks.

1093
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,340
But I would argue even worse was the fact that now that those are a real thing, I sat

1094
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,340
through the entire fucking ending credits of Wonder Woman like, of course, it's going

1095
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,900
to be a fucking end thing and then there fucking wasn't.

1096
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,540
I got played like a god damn fiddle.

1097
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,540
This is what you do, man.

1098
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,260
You got to as soon as the credits start rolling at any movie you're in, you always got to

1099
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,260
take your phone out.

1100
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,980
Remember before you go there, like, is there an ending credit scene?

1101
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,980
Is there a stinger?

1102
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
There's no stinger.

1103
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,980
You just book it.

1104
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,780
No, you have to respect the people who made the movie and look at all their names on the

1105
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,780
big screen, dude.

1106
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,780
I don't fucking care.

1107
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,180
I'll respect them by pirating the movie later, if I get help.

1108
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,700
That's how I'll respect them.

1109
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,220
Iron Man 2 was fun because when I watched it for the first time, I ate some mozzarella

1110
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,140
sticks and then after I watched Iron Man 2, I played Super Mario Sunshine for like all

1111
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,140
night and I 100% of it.

1112
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,700
That sounds like a great evening, not gonna lie.

1113
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:55,020
Iron Man 2 was the first time I realized a movie could be filler.

1114
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,020
Yeah.

1115
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Fuck, not grown-ups, too.

1116
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,020
Fucking Jack and Jill, you know, just a filler movie surrounding a bunch of advertising.

1117
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,020
Jack and Jill's a classic.

1118
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,780
A dunk-a-dunk-a-dunk-a-dunk-a-dunk-a-chino.

1119
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,300
This must never be seen.

1120
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,180
What a legend.

1121
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:20,100
I think Al Pacino wants to play Twisto with your sister.

1122
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
With her sister.

1123
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
That line deserves 100 Oscars.

1124
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Jess is making it funny.

1125
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,380
Jess should have been in the movie because now it's funny to me.

1126
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,380
Okay, here we go, folks.

1127
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,380
Let's just say...

1128
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,380
Okay, I'd say we want to make any final points about this.

1129
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,380
Jess and Jill.

1130
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,380
Let's wait on this issue.

1131
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,380
The greatest movie ever made.

1132
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,820
I think we should just go down the line and vote and, you know, we'll have a vote.

1133
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,820
That sounds good.

1134
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,820
Marvel wins.

1135
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,820
Okay.

1136
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,820
Let's start with...

1137
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,620
Okay, I'm looking at the alphabetical order here.

1138
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
Okay, Jess is up first.

1139
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Jess, Marvel or DC?

1140
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,620
Who wins?

1141
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,620
Marvel wins.

1142
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,620
Bumky?

1143
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,620
Who wins?

1144
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,620
Marvel.

1145
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,620
I don't...

1146
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,620
Marvel.

1147
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,620
Next is Nate.

1148
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
No, you don't fuck them.

1149
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,620
They got rid of the Tower of Terror.

1150
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,620
Fuck them, DC.

1151
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
Who wins?

1152
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,620
God could kill...

1153
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,620
No, no, God could kill...

1154
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,620
Kill the Israeli defensivists.

1155
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,620
This is Sophie's choice.

1156
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,620
Both are nightmarish answers.

1157
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,620
I have to kill myself.

1158
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,620
I'm going to use my park ride and one of them killed children.

1159
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,620
I have to kill myself.

1160
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,620
It's the only way.

1161
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:23,380
Okay, so Munch is an abstention on this.

1162
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,860
I'm going to go with DC just because I'm not that into the Marvel stuff like everybody

1163
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,180
else seems to be and I do love all the old DC stuff.

1164
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,260
So just because I like old DC, I'm voting DC and Tom...

1165
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,060
Are we talking in general or just the movies?

1166
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,060
We're talking all told.

1167
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,060
Everything.

1168
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,060
Dude, that's too hard.

1169
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
I guess I really...

1170
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
We can abstain.

1171
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,060
I don't want to abstain.

1172
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
That's a bitch move.

1173
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Yeah, it is.

1174
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
You're a parody.

1175
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:52,020
You know, I guess I'm going to have to go with Marvel just because I'm watching the movies

1176
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,100
more than I'm reading comics or anything right now, but in terms of just nostalgia, nothing

1177
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,540
can touch watching the Batman Superman adventures.

1178
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,900
That was my fucking jam.

1179
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,420
As much as I love the 90's Spider-Man and stuff, that was so good.

1180
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,900
Oh man, the Superman show was just...

1181
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,420
It made me like humanity and if I go back and watch it now, I'm like, oh yeah, there's

1182
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,020
good in the world.

1183
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,660
So fuck.

1184
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,860
You know, we didn't even talk about the Marvel Netflix shows.

1185
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,860
Those exist.

1186
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,060
Yeah, it was the black guy, right?

1187
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,340
I watched four episodes of Jessica Jones and I hated it.

1188
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,340
Does that count?

1189
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,340
Really?

1190
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,340
Yeah.

1191
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,340
I thought it was pretty good.

1192
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Is that because you're a saganist?

1193
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
You hate women?

1194
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
No.

1195
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,340
If the character was a man, I would probably hate it even more.

1196
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,340
Hmm.

1197
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Why's that?

1198
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,740
I don't like watching men have sex with huge black guys.

1199
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:48,180
Well, you're the only one in this podcast you could say that.

1200
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:53,780
Well, Jesse, what do you have to say about those, Jesse?

1201
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,780
You think they're good?

1202
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,780
You think they're great?

1203
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,180
You think they're the coolest?

1204
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,180
What about that green arrow show?

1205
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,180
Anyone want arrow?

1206
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,580
Oh yeah, DCF shows too.

1207
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,460
No one cares because they're bad too, I think.

1208
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,540
How retarded is it that those have nothing to do with the cinematic universe they're

1209
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,540
building now?

1210
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,620
Now there's going to be two flashes at the same time.

1211
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,620
Yeah.

1212
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,620
Yeah, I don't know.

1213
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,060
I guess I didn't have anything to say.

1214
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:21,980
Daredevil was good, Luke Cage was okay, Jessica Jones I liked, and the other one I didn't

1215
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
watch.

1216
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,980
I did not watch Iron Fist.

1217
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,980
Luke Cage.

1218
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,980
Black Panther.

1219
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,980
I like that one.

1220
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,980
Luke Cage, that's right, that's right.

1221
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,980
I like him.

1222
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
I'm thinking of the Black Panther movie that's coming out, I keep seeing ads for it.

1223
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Oh yeah, that guy's like super, like that guy's like even more black than Luke Cage.

1224
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,580
He's just even blacker.

1225
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,420
He's an African king.

1226
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,420
He was Kang.

1227
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,420
Dude, that guy's so fucking black.

1228
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,420
He was Kang's, dude.

1229
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,420
Yes.

1230
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,420
He is Kang's.

1231
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,420
I think they get so black they can't get black anymore.

1232
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,620
They get even more black.

1233
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,620
It's really wonderful.

1234
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,620
It's the gift that keeps us coming.

1235
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:58,380
Luke Cage better find a new thing to be other than black because he's been out blacked.

1236
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,380
It's true.

1237
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,980
Okay, let's go to questions, right?

1238
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,980
We answered, I think we're good on this shit.

1239
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,980
Okay, here we go.

1240
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,980
Here's some questions, folks.

1241
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:13,260
Here's, at Ichipan asks, we heard Ben and Nate's in Nate's interview, but tell me

1242
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,980
other members of the PCB, what are your favorite movies?

1243
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,980
What's some favorite movies here, folks?

1244
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,860
Forget Marvel and DC, they're all garbage.

1245
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,860
What else you got?

1246
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,860
What are some top picks here to recommend to our viewers?

1247
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,500
All right, here's the three best movies ever made.

1248
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,300
In order, Back to the Future, Inception, and The Neverending Story.

1249
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,300
There you go.

1250
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,300
You're done.

1251
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,740
Don't watch any other movies, just those three.

1252
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
Pretty good.

1253
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,740
What about Bridge to Terabithia?

1254
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,740
Never seen that.

1255
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,740
Yeah.

1256
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,460
I like all movies.

1257
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,620
I like every movie is great.

1258
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:47,740
Anyone who gives any movie a bad review is wrong automatically, for any reason.

1259
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,740
That sounds right.

1260
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,740
That sounds right.

1261
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,180
Munchy, I bet you love yourself some movies.

1262
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:59,700
Munchy, Escape, or, no, no, no, sorry, Number One Favorite Movie, Big Trouble in China,

1263
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,820
Number Two Favorite Movie, Escape from New York, actually no, Escape from LA, and then

1264
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,780
Number Three, Escape from New York.

1265
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,620
And then my third- Fuck Escape from LA sucks, dude.

1266
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,620
Escape from New York is a thousand times better.

1267
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,500
Escape from LA is as fucking sick as fuck.

1268
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,980
And then my fourth favorite is Chinatown.

1269
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,980
So Kurt Russell, your big Kurt Russell guy.

1270
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,220
This all seemed very related.

1271
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:22,220
Big Trouble is good, but Fucking Escape from New York is like a cinematic fucking masterpiece.

1272
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,220
10 out of 10.

1273
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,100
Hey, speaking of China, the actual best movie of all time is The Legend of Drunken Master,

1274
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:33,380
and also Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1, and also Muppet Treasure Island, and also Friday.

1275
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,700
Those are the actual best movies.

1276
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,700
Yes.

1277
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Agreed.

1278
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,220
Is that the movie where they say bye, Felicia?

1279
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes, it is.

1280
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,220
Oh, okay.

1281
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,220
It sure is.

1282
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,220
Oh, oh, oh.

1283
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,220
I learned something about black culture.

1284
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,220
I learned something about black culture.

1285
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,220
The Kirby anime movie.

1286
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,220
Right, of course.

1287
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,020
As to be seen in an upcoming episode of The Pleeve and the Weave, stay tuned, folks.

1288
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,020
Oh, yeah.

1289
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,620
The audio on that, by the way, Jesse, are you going to, or are you just gonna keep it

1290
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,620
as is?

1291
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,660
Um, man, I think that's probably gonna have the least editing of any episode, because

1292
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,940
I'm just gonna let you fucking go.

1293
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,940
Yeah.

1294
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,380
Tom, how about your favorite movies, dude?

1295
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,380
What else have you got?

1296
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Oh, god.

1297
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,380
I'm terrible at answering these questions, because I always remember things.

1298
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,380
What's your favorite?

1299
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,380
Just what's some good ones?

1300
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,380
Vampire Hunter D. Bloodlust is fucking amazing.

1301
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,380
Yes.

1302
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,380
Yes.

1303
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,380
So good.

1304
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,380
I really like Heart String Marionette, which probably no one has seen, because I could

1305
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,380
buy an industrial...

1306
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
I like the one you heard, Bruno.

1307
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Yeah, that's a super fucking cool movie.

1308
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,380
What's the third one?

1309
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,380
Just round it all out.

1310
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,820
Oh, shit.

1311
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,820
Spider-Man 2.

1312
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,820
Spider-Man 2.

1313
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,820
Oh, fuck.

1314
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,820
Yeah.

1315
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,820
Questria Girls.

1316
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,820
Questria Girls.

1317
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,820
We're gonna take you back to Equestria Girls.

1318
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,820
It's the theme song of the show.

1319
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,820
I'm just gonna say, I'm just gonna reiterate Reservoir Dogs.

1320
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,820
It's the greatest film ever made.

1321
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Yeah.

1322
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,820
Okay.

1323
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,820
Okay.

1324
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,820
Oh, also Interstellar 5555.

1325
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,820
Ooh, that's a good choice.

1326
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,820
Yes.

1327
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,820
Yeah, it's a good choice.

1328
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,820
I watched that only last year.

1329
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,820
I hadn't watched it until last year.

1330
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,820
It was very disturbing.

1331
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,820
Yeah.

1332
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
Yeah.

1333
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,820
Yeah.

1334
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,820
Yeah.

1335
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,820
It's the best.

1336
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,820
Okay, next question.

1337
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,820
We'll see what we got here.

1338
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,820
Inglourious bastards.

1339
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,820
Yes, we are.

1340
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
Not as good as Reservoir Dogs, though.

1341
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,820
No, it's much better than Reservoir Dogs.

1342
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
That is a meme.

1343
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,820
I don't know why anyone thinks that.

1344
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,820
It doesn't make any sense.

1345
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:21,300
I don't know why anyone thinks that any Tarantino movie is better than Kill Bill.

1346
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,540
It's the peak of all cinema.

1347
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,460
Reservoir Dogs is the tightest package.

1348
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,660
It's got the best characters.

1349
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,900
I'm not a tight package for you.

1350
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,900
It's small.

1351
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,020
I think it goes to show that since all three of us have a different opinion on the best

1352
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,020
Tarantino movie of all time.

1353
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,020
Tarantino must be pretty fucking good.

1354
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,020
Yeah, I definitely agree with that.

1355
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Well, what was that, Tom?

1356
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:46,660
The best superhero movie of all time is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie.

1357
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,660
That was...

1358
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,660
That's...

1359
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
Yeah.

1360
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
Who could forget Ivy News?

1361
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,540
That movie traumatized me in a deep way.

1362
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,300
I told you guys about the story about how I had a ridiculously high fever and almost

1363
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,660
died and I dreamed that I was the ooze boy.

1364
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,180
That was the coolest shit.

1365
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
It was terrifying.

1366
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,420
I wish I had dreams like that.

1367
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,580
My dreams are always really one day and just like I went out and got a sandwich or something.

1368
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,060
Well, all you need to do is almost die.

1369
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,060
Which you do frequently.

1370
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,060
It's true.

1371
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,060
I just...

1372
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,580
You know, guys, this has been the most agreeable, you know, podcast you've ever done.

1373
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,580
Nothing has been...

1374
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,220
No opinion has been contested, even the ones that contradict the other ones.

1375
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,220
It's true.

1376
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,860
This is the most I've ever liked any of you in a podcast.

1377
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,260
This just goes to show why we need to do this.

1378
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,340
We need to do more topics like this and not any actual issues or philosophical notions

1379
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,980
or ideas ever.

1380
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,980
This talk about...

1381
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,420
This is the only time I've ever liked Nate in general.

1382
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:42,620
Is it wrong that Gal Gadot killed two children on an Italian festival or was it just a father?

1383
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,700
Hey, if we want to do a podcast about like a philosophical topic, is it wrong?

1384
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,820
I mean, really, those kids died so that DC could have good movies.

1385
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,140
Isn't that a reasonable sacrifice?

1386
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm looking forward to the PCP-Palestinian conflict coming up to a week of some time

1387
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,780
soon.

1388
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,780
The next bonus episode.

1389
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,780
Yeah, that'll be the actual most agreeable episode we've ever done.

1390
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:13,940
By the way, I was re-watching the Dignation video the other day and one of the questions

1391
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,300
along the Great Journey was you were just asking...

1392
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,340
It was just like you forgot where Palestine was or something.

1393
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,980
And then I described the entire history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the Israelis

1394
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,180
came in and were just like, fuck you, dude.

1395
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,580
And then immediately we were just like, yeah, yeah, that's how it happened, yeah.

1396
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,580
Oh God.

1397
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,780
Okay, let's...

1398
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,620
Before we get too deep into that shit, okay, here's another question from our buddy a zombie

1399
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,620
ninja cow who's not my buddy, I don't know this man, he's a stranger to me.

1400
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:49,580
And his question is, do any of you do art that you don't release?

1401
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:54,620
Like a craft that you like to do but don't think you're skilled enough at to make public?

1402
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,620
That's an interesting question.

1403
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,660
Who isn't a basket weaving but is ashamed of their basket weaving around here?

1404
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Aren't we all ashamed?

1405
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,220
I mean, I would say that most of my art I don't release because it's mostly all I do

1406
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:11,060
is write faster than I can edit videos, so most of them never get seen.

1407
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,060
That's interesting.

1408
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:16,100
You know, it's funny, this might be, I don't know if everybody does it like this, but I

1409
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,660
release almost every single thing that I make, even through channels that are inappropriate.

1410
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,220
One day I was just making a fucking, I just decided to make a shitty webcomic that was

1411
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,500
very poorly drawn and I released it by adding a link to it on Imgur in the description of

1412
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,940
the video that I happened to put out around that time.

1413
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,900
There's no vehicle I had to deliver that shit, but I actually, I'm fairly non-prolific

1414
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,900
in general.

1415
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,500
I'm changing that recently, but historically, it's taken me a long time to produce things

1416
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,860
because I just will think of a thing and just work really long to make it happen and

1417
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,460
then release it or whatever.

1418
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,180
And you know, I've got a bunch of stuff like in the works, but I all plan on making it,

1419
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,180
so it's not like I don't plan on releasing it at all, but yeah, so I'm like the opposite

1420
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,180
of this.

1421
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,180
I release everything.

1422
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,300
Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you, Nate.

1423
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,380
If I waste time making something, I'm gonna throw it out there and see what people think

1424
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,380
of it.

1425
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,380
Yeah.

1426
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,380
Yeah.

1427
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,380
What were you saying, Munchie?

1428
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,380
I'm like really good Meeze.

1429
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,380
Oh, Meeze, as in the Nintendo cool boys.

1430
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,380
Oh, Wii video game, yeah.

1431
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,900
The best characters in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS.

1432
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Yeah.

1433
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,500
Most of them are black people, so it's easier to make them look bad.

1434
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Too soon, dude.

1435
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
9-11 just happened.

1436
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Too soon.

1437
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,620
Dude, I could have just killed black people.

1438
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,620
Too soon.

1439
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,620
We was just Kang's.

1440
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:41,700
Tom, do you have any, I mean, I know you make a lot of stuff that, I don't know how much

1441
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,980
you've released, but I feel like you're in the same boat of like you're planning on

1442
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,340
releasing it, like your 3D art stuff or your comic?

1443
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,620
Yeah, I'm doing like, I do a bunch of stuff.

1444
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,860
The problem isn't that like I don't want to release it, it's that I hate it and then

1445
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,500
I can't bring myself to release it.

1446
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,500
So I have a bunch of stuff sitting in limbo, but someday.

1447
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,420
Didn't you restart that and make it like a novel thing?

1448
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,660
I've restarted it like seven times.

1449
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,980
I don't even think it exists anymore.

1450
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:08,420
I think it's just like this weird interdimensional, it's like been seeping slowly out of like

1451
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,540
the Berenstein universe or something and I keep like getting it in flashes.

1452
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,540
I don't know what it is.

1453
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,620
You should make a documentary on the making of chapter one of Sorceress Lost or whatever.

1454
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:22,060
I just start doing, I remake that like seven times, it's not even worth it.

1455
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:28,140
Tom, evidently, I've been posting on Twitter that I'm working on this Elliot Roger Diary

1456
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,340
of a Wimpy Kid book and I've been posting art from it and I don't know if you-

1457
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,340
This looks great by the way.

1458
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,340
I don't know if you like to-

1459
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,620
I'm incredibly excited for that project, not gonna lie.

1460
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,100
Well, here's the thing though, Tommy boy.

1461
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,540
I don't know if you liked one of them or if you retweeted it, but some Jackass retard

1462
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:47,260
in my comments said, oh, I can't wait for this Elliot Roger book that Tom Oliver is

1463
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,260
making.

1464
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,260
Oh no!

1465
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,980
I thought, is this motherfucker stealing my idea, the son of a bitch, but I'm guessing

1466
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,540
you just saw it on Twitter by accident.

1467
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,460
I would never, that's your realm my friend.

1468
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,140
Yeah, so I assume you liked it and then Twitter feed said, oh, Tom Oliver liked this and the

1469
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,620
retard thought you posted it.

1470
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,740
Well, yeah, I can't control stupid people.

1471
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,580
Okay, I forgive you for what that guy did.

1472
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,580
Thank you.

1473
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,980
Okay, here's- no, that's a shitty question actually.

1474
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,900
Here's a good question from our good friend at British Ninja Zero.

1475
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,140
He asks simply DC or Marvel.

1476
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,940
I don't know if we have time to go into that.

1477
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,780
I don't know if we have time to go into that one.

1478
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,940
We did not announce this topic or anything, so these people just want to know.

1479
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,980
No, that question sucks ass.

1480
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,340
I'm just gonna read this one.

1481
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,020
I don't know if it's good or not, but I'm reading it.

1482
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:43,060
At El Great Gonzales asks, do any of y'all ingrates know how to bust a move into club

1483
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,860
or anime goth rave?

1484
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,620
Oh, you know it bro!

1485
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:52,820
I bust a move with my anime dames all fucking day dog.

1486
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:57,500
Oh, okay, actually here's an interesting question.

1487
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:03,780
At Dark Gold Game asks, is the human instrumentality project good or bad?

1488
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,580
So we're talking about Evangelion here.

1489
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,740
So is it a bad idea to turn all of humanity into an orange goop and have them all just

1490
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,660
hang out in a primordial ooze again?

1491
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,500
Well, I think the ultimate moral of the film is that it was obviously a good thing because

1492
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,140
if you're cool enough and important enough, you can just come out of it and then you get

1493
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,440
the whole world to yourself.

1494
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,820
So basically it's good because it weeds out the shitty people.

1495
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,180
Yeah, it's good because everyone dies but me.

1496
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,700
We would never have to see Ben singed again.

1497
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,060
Ben is the kind of guy who would be totally chill hanging out in the primordial ooze.

1498
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:39,300
Yeah, he'd be like, hey man, come back into the ooze.

1499
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
We got pizza in here.

1500
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:44,060
Imagine, it's like I don't have to pay rent at all, this is the best.

1501
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,820
Exactly, there's so much freed garbage around everywhere I look.

1502
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,820
Hell yeah.

1503
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,820
Oh, fuck you Ben.

1504
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,820
Here we go.

1505
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,500
Oh, no, that's a shitty question.

1506
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,500
Oh, okay, here we go.

1507
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,820
At WhattaThings asks, what is the best cheese?

1508
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,140
What is the best cheese?

1509
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,140
Pepper Jets.

1510
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,140
Yeah, Pepper Jets.

1511
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,140
Which is pretty good.

1512
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,380
I have access to.

1513
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,380
That yes.

1514
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,940
What cheese is best is cheese that is closest.

1515
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,940
That's very philosophical.

1516
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,300
Also nacho cheese is pretty good.

1517
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,660
Cheese touch bro, cheese touch.

1518
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,700
I'm going to have to say the best cheese is that episode of Chappelle's show where he

1519
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:20,700
goes, I wonder what Arsenio is up to right now and it cuts to Arsenio Hall and he's eating

1520
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,940
cheese at a fancy party and he goes, this is some good cheese.

1521
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,100
That's the best cheese.

1522
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,100
That's good.

1523
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,940
I'm just going to go on the record and say an extremely sharp cheddar is the best cheese.

1524
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,460
I cut my mouth on some of that one time.

1525
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,460
It kind of hurt.

1526
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,460
Yeah, man.

1527
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,460
Yeah, good joke.

1528
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,460
God damn it.

1529
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,460
Fucking hate all of you.

1530
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,460
Oh shit, there was a relevant one.

1531
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,460
Every episode this shit.

1532
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,220
Look, you just fucked it up.

1533
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,020
You used up your bad joke quota with Wonder Woman, all right?

1534
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,020
That was good for like a month.

1535
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,020
That was a good joke.

1536
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,020
That was a masterpiece.

1537
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:59,260
Wonder Woman is the best joke I've seen in a long time.

1538
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,020
Get to a shitty joke makes it a funny joke.

1539
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,620
Okay, here we go.

1540
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,140
I guess we can just reflect on this again.

1541
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:10,820
At Mr. No Name 2001 happened to ask, ask PCB, any thoughts on the passing of the great Batman

1542
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,620
at real Adam West?

1543
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,420
Let's reflect on this.

1544
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,460
Adam West was a cool ass guy.

1545
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,540
He was a cool Batman in the movies.

1546
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,540
I liked his voice.

1547
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,540
He was fun.

1548
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,620
He's a funny, fun.

1549
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,620
He was fun.

1550
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,620
You know what?

1551
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,620
He was also pretty fun.

1552
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,940
He really did have a great voice for Batman.

1553
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:34,500
At least for like the detective aspect of the character, he always sounded right.

1554
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,860
And it's a shame that sometimes he's disregarded as more of a campy version of the character.

1555
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,500
But I mean, his voice sounds way less campy than anything Christian Bale ever did.

1556
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Absolutely.

1557
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,300
Well, here's the thing.

1558
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:53,260
Back when that show came out, that really was a pretty decent representation of what

1559
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,860
the comics were, because comics were way sillier back then, so it was really fucking cool.

1560
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,100
Obviously, the entire Dark Knight trilogy is starting to feel just as campy and dated

1561
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:07,140
in its own way as the Adam West version.

1562
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,140
You got an Adam West Batman.

1563
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,140
Everything's going according to plan.

1564
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:14,100
You got yourself a Christian Bale Batman, and everyone loses their mind.

1565
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,100
That's the greatest.

1566
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,100
That's a good name.

1567
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,740
Actually, you know what was like the coolest thing with Adam West ever was?

1568
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,820
It was to go back to Batman the Animated Series.

1569
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:27,780
It was when the Great Ghost episode, the Great Ghost episode, was the coolest fucking shit

1570
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,300
because I grew up watching the Adam West Batman as a little kid, and then I graduated

1571
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,460
to Batman the Animated Series, and then they collided, and I didn't even realize until

1572
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,340
my dad was like, that's the old Batman.

1573
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,340
I'm like, what?

1574
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
And I'm like, fuck my shit.

1575
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,340
Tommy Oliver, the 70-year-old boy.

1576
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,340
Yes, you got me.

1577
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:54,340
It's me, Adam West, I'm the ghost now, and I enjoy your podcast.

1578
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,340
Hey, thanks, dude.

1579
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
What do you have to say about your whole death situation?

1580
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:02,900
Well, I'm glad it was me who died an old man.

1581
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:07,900
If I had to see two children, for instance, die, the head of the son is really a bitch.

1582
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,900
It is really a bitch that I'd probably go living.

1583
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:19,900
So I'm glad that, you know, I got to live my life before I was seriously killed by Galgogo.

1584
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:26,900
Oh my god, you know what this means, Adam West actually is the gray ghost now.

1585
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,900
Oh my god.

1586
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,900
He is the gray ghost.

1587
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:38,900
He is the gray ghost.

1588
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:51,900
Did Galgogo join the female ghostbusters?

1589
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:56,900
Speaking of the best Marvel movies, how about that female ghostbusters?

1590
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,900
Is that actually affiliated with Marvel?

1591
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Are you fucking stupid?

1592
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:05,900
I certainly hope not, because that will mean I'll have to watch it.

1593
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
I don't know.

1594
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,900
That means I'll have to shift the whole grading.

1595
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,900
Okay, here we go.

1596
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,900
Last question, here we go.

1597
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,900
Here's a fun one about current events in some of our lives.

1598
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:20,900
At WhattaThings asks another question, and it was best and worst things about Digi becoming a nomad bum.

1599
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,900
Well, I'll say the best thing was-

1600
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,900
He's never around to film my fucking podcast.

1601
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,900
That's true, that's true.

1602
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,900
Fuck you, Digi.

1603
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,900
The best thing was when he came to visit me and we hang out and had a great time,

1604
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,900
and I'm going to start editing those videos soon and they'll go up and it'll be a big, fun thing.

1605
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:37,900
Fuck Digi.

1606
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,900
It was good.

1607
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,900
Yes.

1608
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,900
The best thing is that he's doing what he wants.

1609
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,900
The worst thing is that he usurped my idea.

1610
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,900
He should be doing what I want, god damn it.

1611
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
Well, you know.

1612
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,900
I make 60 bucks a month off that podcast.

1613
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,900
I need the fucking money, Digi, you son of a bitch.

1614
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:57,900
Digi, give me that money.

1615
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,900
This is, this is, this is Monkey's Sandy Hook right now.

1616
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,900
This is a rat.

1617
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,900
He's been standing next to me the whole time, laughing.

1618
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Tell me what he said.

1619
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,900
Fuck you.

1620
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,900
Fuck Monkey.

1621
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,900
I'm not doing his podcast right now.

1622
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:11,900
No.

1623
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,900
The whole time he's been here, the only thing he said is,

1624
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,900
I'm not doing Monkey's shitty podcast.

1625
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,900
Consistently.

1626
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,900
But that was Digi's idea.

1627
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
It was his show.

1628
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,900
You know, we've got the DeVue Hydron Collider.

1629
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,900
We've got Digi decompression.

1630
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,900
I'm going to start the Monkey Fuck Digi Chamber,

1631
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,900
where I just talk shit about Digi for an hour.

1632
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,900
That sounds like a good one.

1633
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,900
I think the people will love it.

1634
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,900
It's going to go up the day after this comes out.

1635
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
The Digi degradation chamber.

1636
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,900
Yeah, that's good.

1637
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,900
Yeah, that's it.

1638
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
I was going to do Monkey's Suicide Perch, but it was too sad,

1639
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,900
so I'm going to do this instead.

1640
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Suicide Perch?

1641
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
Okay, you know what?

1642
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
There's one question here that has to be addressed.

1643
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,900
This will be our last one.

1644
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,900
Okay, it's at XGUpload asks,

1645
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,900
Are chads overrated?

1646
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,900
And I would have to say no.

1647
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,900
Chads are underrated.

1648
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,900
Chads are underrated, for sure.

1649
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,900
Everyone should strive to be as chaddly as possible.

1650
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,900
Yeah, it worked out great for Ziz.

1651
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:06,900
It did.

1652
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,900
I mean, what better way to go than dying in a Burmese brothel

1653
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
or something, like an Armenian brothel, one of those things?

1654
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,900
Yeah.

1655
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,900
You know?

1656
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,900
If those two fucking kids were just more chad enough,

1657
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,900
what would have been fucking swooned by their physique

1658
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,900
and, you know, social skills?

1659
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,900
It's their own fucking fault they died.

1660
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,900
Gal Gadot would have dropped her gun or drone device,

1661
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,900
drone controller, and been like, my god, their beauty.

1662
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,900
Those chads, I can't do it.

1663
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,900
I can't do this to them.

1664
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,900
If only the world had more chads,

1665
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,900
there would be peace on earth as long as.

1666
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
Nobody would get bullied.

1667
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Gal Gadot would account for like 50% of the fucking murders

1668
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,900
in Palestine.

1669
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,900
It's half Gal Gadot, half the Danny Phantom kid.

1670
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Yes.

1671
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,900
That's right.

1672
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,900
Okay.

1673
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,900
All right.

1674
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,900
I guess we're done, folks.

1675
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,900
Remember to send us more questions at our Twitter's at tpcrasnairs,

1676
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,900
but just send them any time using the hashtag askpcp,

1677
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,900
and we'll fucking answer them.

1678
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,900
All right, everybody.

1679
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:05,900

Okay, this is a short episode.

1681
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,900
This guy.

1682
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,900
It's the last time I've seen combat so I can kill you.

1683
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
I can't eat the food.

1684
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,900
Oh, shit.

1685
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,900
I forgot I was a prisoner.

1686
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,900
I said that at the beginning of the episode.

1687
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,900
Oh, that's right.

1688
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
I forgot.

I think it's any of us.

1702
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,900
I made that.

1703
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,900
It was me.

1704
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:36,900
It was me who made it.

1705
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,900
Just for the patrons.

1706
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,900
It's a cool place to be a cool boy,

1707
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,900
and we kill everyone there who's not a cool guy.

1708
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Yeah.

1709
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:45,900

The last one was a Chuck E. Cheese versus Five Nights at Freddy's.

1714
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,900
World acclaimed masterful podcast.

1715
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,900
It was indeed.

1716
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,900
Thanks a lot to the presence of our friend,

1717
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,900
Munchie, where's Tiny Hats?

1718

So, thanks, everybody, for listening.

And we will see you next time.

1720

Killed me.

1722
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,900

01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,900
Waiter.

1727
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,900

Oh, my God.

1731
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,900
Skalkado.

1732
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,900
She's the one who killed me.

1733
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,900
Oh, shit.

1734
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,900
Oh, no.

1735
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,900
She's gay.

1736
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,900
She's gay.

1737
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,900
Bored.

1738
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,900
Yeah.

1739
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,900
Boy cut Wonder Woman.

1740
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,900
Yeah.

1741
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,900
Oh.

1742
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:31,900
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1743
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:36,900
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1744
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,900
But I'm not working.

1745
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,900
I'm doing nothing.

1746
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,900
My dick, I'm jerking.

1747
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,900
Myself, I'm sucking.

1748
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,900
I am an asshole.

1749
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,900
I am a stupid.

1750
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,900
I've got a deadline.

1751
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,900
Don't want to do it.
