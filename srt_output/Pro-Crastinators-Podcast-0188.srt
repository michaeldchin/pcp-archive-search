00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Rise and shine gamers and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,120
I, as you know, am the best morning boy and we've got Ben Saint.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
Who?

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I, I, I, that's a name I haven't heard in years, Vapes.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,440
We've got Tom Oliver.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm the worst morning boy because the mornings are shit.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,720
It's all about hardcore nighttime nocturnal power.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,080
Guys, it's 1pm and it's, it's not the morning and second of all, Tom, you're wrong because

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,560
time zones just changed.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,800
That thing happened or and what's what happens when the clock, the clock, yeah, and now it

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,920
gets dark at like 4pm.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,560
It's dark for like 18 hours of the day now.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Right.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm in my element.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Far longer.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Oh, you know, it's too much.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Let's get back to this.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,160
That's a good topic, but also Mages here.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Hello.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Hello.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Hello.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
I hate the cold.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Speaking of time zones.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Yeah.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
I hate the cold.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
That we all agree on, I hope.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I, I do like coats.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
I do like winter coats.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Oh, God.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Ben, your politics are one thing, but liking the cold is, is something I cannot stand

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
for.

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
No, no, I don't, I don't, I don't like the cold.

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,560
I don't like the cold, but I do like wearing big coats.

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,600
Well, surely we could all agree that being inside, while there's perhaps a layer of snow

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,840
and it's lightly snowing, but you're warm inside with a blanket and perhaps a cup of

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,320
warm beverage can be a very enjoyable experience.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,760
It's the juxtaposition you see, the, the, the contradiction in terms that leads to ultimate

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
pleasure.

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,160
As you cast your gaze outside at the fucking broken homeless freezing and you in your gated

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
castle.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
It just makes me feel great.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Yes.

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
It just makes her plus capital.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
It just makes me feel so warm and happy inside.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Nate, I, I went to the parents place for Thanksgiving and was it nice?

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Everyone have a good time?

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
It was fine.

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
It was good.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,960
And, and they, mom was like here, you know, he got some stuff and here's, you know, Nate

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,160
said he didn't want this and it was, he was like a black.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
It wasn't my shoes was it?

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
She's not giving away more shoes.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,960
No, it was like a black coat with like a furry hood.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Okay.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
All right.

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Okay.

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
You know what?

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,640
This is a perfect example of what happened with the shoes because when I spoke to mom,

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,880
I remember this explicitly.

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:41,600
I said, when I come to visit at Christmas, I will decide whether it fits or not.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,560
If it doesn't fit, mom, I told her this, then we will decide about what to do with it.

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
She told me it didn't fit.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
She was like here.

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
She is a fucking liar.

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,920
She was like Nate said, she said, Nate said this doesn't fit.

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,880
It didn't fit him anymore.

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Do you want it?

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
And I was like, I guess.

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah.

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Okay.

71
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,640
There's, there's some confusion going on in mom's head as usual, I guess, because we

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
just spoke about this.

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
I get why it was undermined.

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,680
I said, I suspect it doesn't fit, but I will try it on when I'm there in like 25 days,

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
mom, for Christmas.

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
Don't give it away until then.

77
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
I like that coat.

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,320
It may be too small, but I guess I'll find if it fits Ben, it probably fits me.

79
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,640
So there you go, mom.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
The fuck.

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,080
This is exactly what happened with the shoes.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,520
I have no doubt this confirms it in my mind.

83
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,160
Mom is just looking to fuck me over as many ways as possible.

84
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Yes.

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Absolutely.

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
You see what she's trying to do?

87
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,600
She's trying to force me to take drastic action.

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
That woman's vindictive.

89
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
There's no doubt in my mind.

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Well, this Christmas, she's going to get the gift of a lifetime.

91
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
This is going to be prisoner Christmas.

92
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,120
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

93
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,480
Yeah, that's how I feel right now.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm thinking of buying a tree, though.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,120
I think of buying a tree for the apart.

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Like a little small, fake tree.

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
We can be allowed.

98
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,200
I just want to look at it and feel happy, you know, Christmas spirit.

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,560
I hate feeling happy.

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,400
I see. I see in the in the stores, like these little tiny potted, fake Christmas

101
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,160
trees, I was like, maybe, maybe this year will be the year I'll get a little tiny

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
tree. Why not?

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Just, just, just it makes me happy.

104
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,720
I agree.

105
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
That's the whole point.

106
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,560
That's what these things are supposed to do.

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,880
And I don't know, out here, being on our own, out here, not live on their

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,680
families anymore, there's none of this like group family camaraderie or spirit.

109
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,920
Like when you're, when you're like in school and like everyone around you is

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
talking about it and like all the teachers and all the events are like, you

111
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,800
know, holiday oriented, it really instills that spirit in you.

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,680
But once you're on your own, you kind of got to, you got to force yourself

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
into that mindset.

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
And I think that it's, it's well worth the slight amount of effort and money.

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,440
It just, it gives you a stat buff of happiness temporarily.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,640
I love Christmas just because like, uh, yeah, winter is so dreary and depressing

117
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
and sad and dark and cold.

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
But then like, well, well, Christmas comes around, uh, or just before like a

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
month or two before Christmas rolls around, uh, everything, all the stores

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
and people sometimes like decorate and shiny, sparkly, glittery things.

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
And it's like, oh, it looks so nice and bright and cheerful and colorful.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,680
And I like it.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,640
It's like after New Year's ends though, everything just goes so dark and it's

124
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,000
sad when like real winter begins.

125
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,200
Like I never feel that cold in December because of these things, I think, but

126
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,960
in January, that's when hell has begun.

127
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
I think January and February are technically the cold this month just

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
because of how we are rotates.

129
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
It's because you have something to look forward to.

130
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,640
So you ignore the cold, but as soon as it's all over, you're like, wait a minute,

131
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,240
this fucking sucks.

132
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
And I guess, I mean, what's the next like holiday?

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Easter?

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,800
Valentine's Day, I guess.

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,720
I mean, yeah, Easter, I suppose.

136
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,720
Boring love and God.

137
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,680
No, thanks.

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,480
I don't believe in either of those, sir.

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,760
So speaking of holidays, did you buy anything for the Black Friday sales and stuff?

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,440
I totally skipped it.

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't give a shit.

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Oh, you know, tomorrow's Cyber Monday, though.

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,080
So I probably will just, you know, do the easy thing and go to Amazon.

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,800
I need it.

145
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
It's like the online equivalent of Black Friday.

146
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,240
I need a fucking cord for my charger, my mobile charger that I got for Pokemon Go.

147
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,640
I bought a fucking good cord to charge my phone and then it disappeared like a week later.

148
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,680
I was like, I'm going to still like, I finally, I finally committed to accepting

149
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,000
that all my previous chords had been lost and I would never find them again.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
I swallowed my pride.

151
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,640
I bought a new one and then it was gone.

152
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,760
I almost bought something for Black Friday, but I was I was

153
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,640
bamboozled.

154
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,960
I wanted I wanted to get a new power supply for my for the streaming computer

155
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,400
because I'm getting a new streaming setup to do more I am game streams.

156
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,920
And I was like, this power supply is shit.

157
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,560
I don't want this computer running 24 seven with like a budget power supply

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
that came from like some crazy Chinese case I got like 10 years ago.

159
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
It'll probably explode.

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
So I found a sick power supply like on sale.

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I was like, oh, dope.

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm buying this sick.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,320
Good Black Friday went to grab my debit card, came back downstairs, sale over.

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm like, what the fuck?

165
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
It's 1230.

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
What the fuck?

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
It's still there.

168
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,840
It's not out of stock.

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,320
It's just now three times as expensive for some reason in like the 20 seconds

170
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,400
between I'm going to buy that and man, dude, the worst.

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,080
So fuck you, new egg, you piece of shit.

172
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,400
You lost the sale.

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,360
Trust muncher.

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
I bought like two games.

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,520
That reminds me it's on Thanksgiving.

176
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,640
We give thanks for things that we appreciate right now.

177
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,000
I thought of something that I'm thankful for and I'm thankful

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,280
for the continual movement I'm seeing towards this.

179
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,440
I believe it's called, do we call it the Type C charger?

180
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
USB Type C.

181
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
Yeah, USB.

182
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Yes.

183
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,840
This, the fact that the whole world, it's the oval.

184
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,480
Yeah.

185
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,360
It's the one that's reversible.

186
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,640
Yeah.

187
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,080
And it works on both sides.

188
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
It's reversible.

189
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,640
The fact that we're getting this technology, look, the round ones were shit.

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Type C, this is the way to go.

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,400
The fact that it's becoming more and more universally adopted

192
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,280
in things brings me such joy.

193
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,400
And once we just all are using one type of board, I don't like it

194
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
because my phone doesn't take it.

195
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
Well, OK, we'll get a new phone, Ben, 10 years.

196
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,280
And we'll all, well, the sick thing about USB Type C is the dope.

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,200
The dopest thing about Type C is it's not even just like phone connectors.

198
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,880
Type C does everything.

199
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,560
It does display how it does USB.

200
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,000
So like, assumedly, like 10 years from now, literally, you'll just go

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,200
like on your computer and it'll just be Type C, everything

202
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,440
because every port will do anything you want it to.

203
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Oh, fantastic.

204
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Well, yeah, it's exactly what we should be doing.

205
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,680
We'll all be like birds with just one hole that does everything.

206
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh, yeah.

207
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
I look forward to our avian future.

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
But yeah.

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
Simple, efficient, elegant.

210
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
The cloaca.

211
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,280
Speaking of speaking of things that are literally lighter than air, such as birds,

212
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,080
I wanted to give everyone a life update on a little beast named Lord Sashomaru.

213
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,720
And it's that everyone's been mocking Sashomaru, been talking shit

214
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,280
about how fat my dog is.

215
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,800
So you're fine.

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,640
You starved him for months and now he's skin and bones.

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,640
He's been on a little diet toe and he has in fact lost three pounds.

218
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,840
He went from 28 pounds to 25 pounds.

219
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,160
And that's a hell of a loss.

220
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,520
That's like over 10 percent.

221
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,280
That's pretty good.

222
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,120
I took a sword.

223
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
I just cleaved his fucking head off.

224
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
Just instantly, three pounds were gone.

225
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
Just cut his tail off.

226
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,760
You know, that was like two pounds of extra weight that he didn't need.

227
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,440
Now it's gone.

228
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
But even after losing the weight, the thing is he I was I'm vindicated

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,440
because he looks exactly the same.

230
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,400
He's just got a weird corgi body and it's not his fault that he's big

231
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,720
boned and wide and a strange creature that no one will ever love.

232
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
Oh, you know, that's the same curse I have.

233
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,960
No matter how much weight I lose, I still am somehow still fat.

234
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,560
It just doesn't matter.

235
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,200
It just comes from mystery areas.

236
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't I look to say I've lost like 10 pounds.

237
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,800
I look fucking exactly the same.

238
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,040
But, you know, Sessha was at like a doggy daycare thing.

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,120
We were just like testing a new one because when we go to Christmas,

240
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,320
he's got to stay at a daycare place and there is a what we call the Beagle Brigade.

241
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
There's just a squad of Beagles and Sessha is half Beagle.

242
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
So, you know, the Beagle Brigade now that the Beagle Brigade, to be fair,

243
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,680
is somewhat exclusive.

244
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
They don't just let any Beagle join their ranks.

245
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,920
You have to be up to a certain snuff.

246
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,200
But when Sessha attempted to ooze his way into their ranks, as he does,

247
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,280
there was an immediate harsh rejection of flagrant racism.

248
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Flagrant, you know, this is like the canine equivalent of like a half elf

249
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,920
just sparred by both by both fucking cultures.

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
He has nowhere to be. Exactly.

251
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,600
It's it's deeply fucked up and it's it's unacceptable.

252
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
It sounds like some shonen protag material.

253
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
He can rise above the the spurs of his peers

254
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,880
and unite the races once and for all.

255
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,400
I, you know, I can't get down with this multiracial interbreeding bullshit,

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,280
though, because I mean, they told us over and over again

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,760
that human Saiyan hybrids were quote unquote better than pure blood

258
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,040
Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z.

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,280
Why did Gohan lose every fight he ever fought in, except the one during

260
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,560
the Cell Saga that obviously was cheating?

261
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
The only one that the ghost of Goku won.

262
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,680
Yeah, he needed the ghost of a pure Saiyan to help him out.

263
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
That's exactly right.

264
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,520
So, you know, you're I don't know,

265
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,720
Future Trunks was a badass like through and through a hundred percent.

266
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,760
You're not wrong.

267
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
I mean, I mean, is anyone more badass than Trunks

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,280
when he like fucking trains hardcore, goes back to his timeline

269
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,920
and just immediately mercs everybody, even though he knows

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
that these androids could be like good people deep down.

271
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,280
But no, it's immediately murders regardless.

272
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,480
No consideration about this fucking incredible down.

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,840
You touch on the larger question of what is morality?

274
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Sure, sure, sure, sure, you know, different timelines.

275
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,240
But I'm just saying if I was in that if I was in that situation,

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,920
I would have a little like maybe like seven seconds of pause.

277
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,640
Our boy Trunks, zero.

278
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,240
No, just immediately murdered, like taking great joy in doing so.

279
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,160
And then tracks down Cell, mocks him and then immediately kills him.

280
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
Greatest, greatest character ever.

281
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,320
Just to find goodness as not vulnerable to the tip of my sword.

282
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Indeed, you're done.

283
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Speaking of which, did you guys ever watch like the Future Trunks

284
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,920
there had like his own saga in Dragon Ball Super

285
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,840
that they tell me is like the best one in Dragon Ball Super?

286
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
Does anybody go watch that?

287
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,160
I've seen like one episode of Dragon Ball Super.

288
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,040
And I saw one clip from the Super with like with where

289
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,760
Mr. Satan sort of punches Goku, but not really.

290
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
And Goku's like, oh, no, I'm falling.

291
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
I forgot my tractor.

292
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,400
I got my tractor. Yeah, that was making the rounds on Twitter.

293
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,040
Yep, that's the only thing I saw.

294
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,480
I mean, I just I just referred to the God of Dragon Ball

295
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,360
that I know Jax played on Twitter.

296
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
And he's always saying that Super is garbage

297
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,720
except for the slice of life stuff.

298
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
So I just take his word for it.

299
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
Yeah, you know, just out of curiosity,

300
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
is Jax a fan of like Dragon Ball Classic?

301
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,680
Yes, that's the mark of like a true.

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,600
He's he's he's on record, I believe, saying that it is better than Z.

303
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,240
It's better than. Oh, my God, that's unusual.

304
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
But OK, I mean, I agree.

305
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,440
I think original Dragon Ball is better than Z as well.

306
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,760
So I mean, it's got to be more.

307
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,520
It's just, I mean, have you seen it as a classic, obviously,

308
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,960
but there's tons of bullshit that we've all just kind of accepted and moved past

309
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,000
have you watched Dragon Ball? It's definitely there.

310
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,360
I've you know, I've read the manga up to, like, I don't know.

311
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,080
I remember I think right when like he started to fight that guy,

312
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,840
he throws logs, lousy and like stands on him or whatever,

313
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,360
which is where things get really crunk, as I recall.

314
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,000
I just gave up of speaking of reading manga.

315
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,120
I started reading one piece again.

316
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm up to

317
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
actually, it's been this is like last week I did, but I'm up to chapter eight,

318
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,600
fifty five. What's happening?

319
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Jesus, we are at.

320
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
Oh, fuck, they.

321
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,320
Well, it would be kind of spoilery to say, but they are.

322
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,640
I mean, you're in the so you're in Big Mom Ark, I assume.

323
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,320
Yeah, I'm pretty well into Big Mom Ark.

324
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,400
The girl, she's putting putting.

325
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,200
Yeah, we saw putting's thing.

326
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,200
You know, OK, I believe I do know.

327
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,600
The things you were saying, yes, he understood.

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,520
OK, that's cool. That's cool.

329
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,240
Well, great. It's really cool.

330
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
It's great. It is great.

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,640
And perhaps this, the the Whole Cake Island Ark is is is quite

332
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,520
luscious and delicious and excellent overall.

333
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm happy to say.

334
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,800
And if you get caught up, hey, maybe this legendary appearance

335
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
on the Padi cast could happen.

336
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,640
Yeah, what is what chapter is as one piece at currently?

337
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,840
Like how is it nine hundred something, right?

338
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,880
Oh, you're right around nine hundred sixty five or so.

339
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
So he's got a hundred chapters together.

340
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,120
I like I like how you have like barely any you're almost caught up

341
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,480
with a hundred something chapters.

342
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,720
Meanwhile, I'm reading more than most stars,

343
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,720
which is like a hundred and fifty chapters in total.

344
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah, I read like a hundred and I read like a hundred and twenty

345
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,280
chapters the other day. And oh, there you go.

346
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,400
Yeah, it's pretty good.

347
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
I wasn't doing anything.

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,680
Yeah, that's cool.

349
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,840
Did you read through all of zoe in doing that zoe?

350
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Wait, on the island on the big elephants, man.

351
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,640
Yes. Yes.

352
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,600
He's got to love that arc, man.

353
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh, the fucking rhizo arc with the manker.

354
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Oh, my God, it's one of my favorite moments in the whole fucking series.

355
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
Oh, wait, they still have carrot.

356
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,280
Carrot is still around from everyone's favorite character.

357
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,600
Fucking carrot. Oh, she's going to join the crew.

358
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,560
I mean, she is pretty cute.

359
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,480
She's not going to.

360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,680
She doesn't seem only positive quality.

361
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you're right, of course.

362
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,240
She's literally like the female chopper.

363
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,360
Chopper has done nothing for a thousand chapters like the female chopper.

364
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,960
Even though there is literally a female chopper, there's like a reindeer nurse lady.

365
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, yeah. But that's not the female chopper.

366
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,280
Carrot is a female chopper.

367
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,480
You know, I'll just we'll move on from one piece, guys, I promise.

368
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
But I just want to say that on the subject of chopper,

369
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,680
chopper is the one piece member who has been the most forgotten as a real

370
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,920
character by a huge margin.

371
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,120
I mean, guys like Brooke get some stupendous moments

372
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,920
in at various times, Frankie once in a while gets a little cool flight

373
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,520
and dress Rosa, but chopper, nothing, absolutely nothing.

374
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,800
But there there is a great opportunity.

375
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,120
Wano is kind of like the Zoan Ark and chopper is the Zoan guy on the crew

376
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,800
and the fucking monster balls or the rumble balls are like a unique thing

377
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,840
that tie into like Zoan powers.

378
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,720
If Odit doesn't capitalize on that, I will be so deeply disappointed,

379
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,960
but I have almost no faith that anything interesting will be done with

380
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
chopper ever again until the end of the series.

381
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,840
There's just too many characters.

382
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,440
I just say I still I still like Jinbei that much.

383
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,720
Oh, brother, you're preaching the choir over here, man.

384
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm just not I'm just not that interested in Jinbei.

385
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm not that interested.

386
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm not I'm not interested in law.

387
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,960
Like it's just all the right things, Ben.

388
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
You're doing it well.

389
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,720
It's just that I feel like Oda made a really makes a really big deal out

390
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,200
of like Jinbei coming back and I'm just like, yeah, OK, all right.

391
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,360
You know, it's a funny thing because when you realistically think about it,

392
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,560
Jinbei has done some truly stupendous things to help the straw hats.

393
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,760
Like he's saved Luffy at Marine for it.

394
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,080
He did that. He joined the rebellion like to leave the jail.

395
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Well, so did a bond.

396
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,760
Like a fishman.

397
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,440
So did bond Clay.

398
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,480
Nobody's going wild about bond Clay over here.

399
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Yes, I had to look up here because I wanted to see how cute she is.

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,080
And I like this form of her.

401
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
It's in the gross discussing.

402
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
Oh, it's going to be a spoiler.

403
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't show Ben. Don't show Ben.

404
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Oh, OK.

405
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,440
Sorry, I'm not reading it so I'll check it out.

406
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,440
I mean, you know, I don't care.

407
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm looking. I'm fucking looking.

408
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,120
Oh, shit.

409
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,520
Wait, is that?

410
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,080
Is that real?

411
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Yeah, I mean, that's it's a thing that happens.

412
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,200
Well, it's a that is a whole thing made for it.

413
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,240
Oh, yeah, you're not.

414
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,600
You're not wrong.

415
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,120
Is that does she either rumble ball and that happens?

416
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,080
No, I mean, it's all the minks have this thing that under a full moon,

417
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,960
they turn to the Zulong, which is actually exactly like Goku from Dragon Ball.

418
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
He also becomes the Zulong Monkey Man form.

419
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
They just go like super powerful.

420
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,280
I don't feel like I've ruined anything by knowing that.

421
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,080
Yeah, there's it's yeah.

422
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
She just gets extra fluffy and I like it.

423
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
And she basically goes into mega Ampharos form.

424
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
Yes, that. Yes, yes.

425
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,520
Anyway, one piece is wicked cool.

426
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,760
Indeed, indeed.

427
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,880
For all those haters out there, for all the bullies who tell me, like,

428
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,600
no, Nate, you know, law is cool.

429
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
Gene Bay is cool.

430
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
I just want to point out to the record.

431
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,880
Here's a guy who just got cut up and feels very similar to me.

432
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,360
I'm not a crazy person.

433
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,120
The one thing about my fucking mind here that I like, like, laws fine.

434
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,760
He he's not he has not doing very much these days.

435
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,040
Like, he'll just kind of like, yeah, his over.

436
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,640
Yeah, he'll just kind of be standing behind Luffy and like make a comment here

437
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
and there and like, that's cool.

438
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,440
That's fine.

439
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,680
When the fights are like about him, his power is not interesting.

440
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,240
His power is dumb.

441
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I mean, it's it's complicated.

442
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
It's kind of cool.

443
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,800
There's kind of like Robin's power.

444
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
It's a little too open ended.

445
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,360
I don't think it's fun shown in fights.

446
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,440
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,760
Yeah, exactly.

448
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,240
Yeah, right.

449
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,160
And, you know, the only thing I'll say is that I definitely agree with you.

450
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,400
And I I really feel the guys like, like, I mean, Ace is dead,

451
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,760
but like to a degree like Ace,

452
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,520
Ace actually has his own bunch of like side novels

453
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,000
that they're writing about Ace specifically in his adventures.

454
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
I mean, sounds fine.

455
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,280
But we know how that journey ends.

456
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,040
So how interesting could they really be?

457
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,720
Well, I mean, hey, I know it's about the adventure,

458
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,360
not the destination, blah, blah, blah.

459
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,080
Hey, question.

460
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,960
Do you think do you think that Marco the Phoenix could hurt Ace?

461
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,400
I think yes, because if Magma could hurt Ace's fire because it's hotter.

462
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,600
Marco's Phoenix fire has to be hotter than Ace's regular fire, right?

463
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,640
It is explicitly stated somewhere

464
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,160
that Marco's flames actually do not produce heat.

465
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
They're a magical, special kind of fire

466
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,200
that is totally unique and distinct from normal fire.

467
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,320
Never mind.

468
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,120
Never fucking mind.

469
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,320
It's that's that's what it is.

470
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
I don't fucking know.

471
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Excellent.

472
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,920
Oh, and I was just going to say that I feel like characters

473
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,440
like like law are literally like only consistently in the narrative still.

474
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Like, we all know that it was part of his plot,

475
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,520
like fight kind of so it makes sense.

476
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,560
He's involved, but he doesn't have to be on screen,

477
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,400
except that he places so unbelievably high in the character poll rankings

478
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,120
that it's almost it'd be like it'd be a bad move to not continually have him there.

479
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,000
And I really feel that drives why he takes up the screen time he does to.

480
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,840
What? I mean, I feel I like what it is.

481
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,120
Oda will basically just have him like sort of looking grumpy

482
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,200
and like saying something kind of like annoyed lately.

483
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
And like, I think that's fine and good.

484
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
And it is what he should be doing.

485
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,720
Well, you know, to like Kinemon was with the boys for a long time.

486
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
And I like never got annoyed by Kinemon.

487
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,760
I just would be like, I mean, what's this guy do?

488
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,880
When's he going to get his thing?

489
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,160
And he finally has in Wano.

490
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
So like, that's cool.

491
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,760
But last to say about all these things.

492
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,960
Go listen to the putty cast. Good stuff. Good stuff.

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,280
Boy, I have a question.

494
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,160
Sure. Have you guys like seen any discourse about Naruto,

495
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,600
like Sakura versus Hinata and stuff on your Twitter?

496
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Because I've seen loads of it.

497
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
Not particularly.

498
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,840
No, I think it comes from one source, particularly.

499
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,960
But like, they're very.

500
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,880
Is this Boruto related or classic Naruto?

501
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,520
And just in general, I think it might span the whole

502
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,560
Naruto verse or whatever.

503
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,960
People still hate Sakura and but they like Hinata apparently

504
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
for the same things they hate Sakura for.

505
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,760
Or at least that's the claim people.

506
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,480
They hate Hinata. Who hates Hinata?

507
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
No, no, no. She said they like Hinata.

508
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,960
They don't like Sakura.

509
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,160
Yeah. But like, people who like Sakura just as a backlash

510
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,840
start hating on Hinata just because people don't hate Hinata.

511
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,680
And it's just such a weird stupid mess.

512
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,280
Do you have any feelings on either of the characters?

513
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm interested to hear.

514
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,400
I mean, no, nothing, nothing much, not really.

515
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,920
I don't know. I mean, I've thought about this plenty

516
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,560
as as as I was a reader of Naruto and whatnot.

517
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,760
It just seems that like, I mean, Hinata is kind of

518
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,160
she was just the what's the word?

519
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,360
She was kind of the grassroots favorite girl

520
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,000
that like obviously not a lot of emphasis was put on her at

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,760
front at first, but like her just quiet like liking of Naruto

522
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
and appreciation of the character the same way the audience did.

523
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,920
I think just like the lack of being annoying in any way.

524
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,000
It's so it's so easy to like Hinata.

525
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Yeah, it's so easy. I get it.

526
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Yeah, it makes sense to be fair.

527
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,880
I cannot. I used to be my favorite back when I was watching

528
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,800
just because I could sort of relate to her because shy, quiet.

529
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah, it's it's in dear.

530
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,080
It's endearing. Yeah, Sakura.

531
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
I would hate I hated her.

532
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,320
I like the woman to know her place.

533
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,520
You know what I'm saying? It really does a lot for me.

534
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
I hate it, Sakura, just because like she was very loud, obnoxious, mean

535
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,040
and violent. Yeah, like it's not so we all aspire to be.

536
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,560
I still don't like Sakura to this age,

537
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,280
but just because they're still like lingering feelings from those times

538
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,560
when I actually used to watch Naruto, but I haven't seen her in the new,

539
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,080
you know, like I haven't really watched Shippuden and I haven't really watched

540
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,720
Boruto. Well, I don't know.

541
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,600
I got one good fight in Shippuden as the show goes on.

542
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,520
Yeah, I know she does not.

543
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,880
Sakura sucks. She never does anything cool.

544
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,000
She has she has some cool scenes.

545
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,800
Like when she fights, what's his name? All the puppet guy.

546
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,440
I was going to say, let's not forget that in that fight,

547
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
look, I watched that fight again.

548
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,960
It's not even really her doing the fight.

549
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
But she's the old lady.

550
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,920
But it's her super strength.

551
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,080
Like she like she legitimately

552
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,360
brings her own super strength to contribute to that battle.

553
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,520
OK, you're not wrong.

554
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
And that's not like a nod.

555
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
Well, as the fight goes on, though, she has the best thing Sakura ever did.

556
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,320
As the fight goes on, she has to fight by herself as well, too.

557
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,080
If that's OK, if that's the best thing Sakura ever did,

558
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,120
then I guess I'm glad I stopped reading when I did.

559
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,680
I think that was a wise move.

560
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,400
But compared that to at the very end of of Shippuden during the final battle,

561
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
they of course give the like when Sasuke final is like, OK,

562
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,960
I'll help you guys fight the final battle.

563
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,600
They do the like Team Seven has reunited Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke.

564
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,520
I actually just happened to see this the other day and like they give

565
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,440
they give Sakura like they just like give her a token punch.

566
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,320
Agreed. And then Naruto looks over and goes like,

567
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,040
oh, wow, Sakura's really come a long way.

568
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,920
Naruto is a billion times stronger than this girl.

569
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
Sasuke is 10 billion times stronger than her.

570
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,960
OK, but it's so pandering.

571
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,600
OK, OK, OK, but like no, no, listen, but like Sasuke has like his eyes thing.

572
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,480
And Naruto has like a demon in him.

573
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,800
Sakura is just a normal girl that just became super strong.

574
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
I know. Boring.

575
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,040
She also didn't she also become like a doctor?

576
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,960
That's pretty cool.

577
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,280
Well, she got trained by what's her face?

578
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,960
To not. And so she gets like like her.

579
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,560
And you know what?

580
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,840
Tsunade sucks, too.

581
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,440
Tsunade never did anything cool.

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,120
She punches hard sometimes and summons a snail.

583
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
These are the two things she ever does.

584
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,640
Punching hard is kind of cool. Boring.

585
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
If I could punch hard, I'd do it.

586
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,600
Snails are pretty epic.

587
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
In a series like Naruto.

588
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,160
Just OK, the problem is in a series like Dragon Ball Z,

589
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
punching hard matters is important.

590
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,600
Like technical fighting techniques matter in Naruto.

591
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,320
Like Taijutsu and stuff is like never developed at all.

592
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,000
It's just either you can punch really hard or you can't.

593
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,200
You've got one card to play and like that's she plays that card

594
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,440
and it's boring every single time it's played.

595
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,800
The punching hard card is so one note in Naruto

596
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
because the series isn't designed for it.

597
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,360
I somehow have both feelings that that Sakura is cool,

598
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,040
but she also got totally cucked by the show and should have done more.

599
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
A bit. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how those are

600
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
both in my head at the same time, but they are.

601
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,280
Yeah, I think Sakura does have potential, at least from what I know of her

602
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,840
and all the things is just, yeah, the show doesn't.

603
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,520
It's not about her, the show, sadly, and she doesn't get a lot of screen time.

604
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,560
She gets token screen time.

605
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Yes, she does.

606
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,520
Which is what you said, her fault.

607
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I mean, no, but is it her fault that she has the worst thing?

608
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,560
The worst thing Sakura does is forgive Sasuke.

609
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm sorry. That was.

610
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Oh, my God, after all he did to her, it's funny, hilarious.

611
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,960
And Rockley is there the whole time being the coolest guy in the entire show.

612
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,200
Disgusting, disgusting.

613
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,360
That Sakura's why I hate women. Confirmed.

614
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,160
Yeah, yeah, let's all simmer down and just watch a good,

615
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,960
a good old Naruto AMV set to Linkin Park.

616
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,360
Yes, do you see into the.

617
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,920
Got to watch Naruto versus Gaara set to disturb circa 2003.

618
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah, that's my shit.

619
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,240
That's my shit, Tom. Fucking aesthetic.

620
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,040
I had once made like an R2MV set to like

621
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,760
have an essence bring me to life.

622
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,640
Oh, is it so on YouTube?

623
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,360
You were one of the billions, one of the billions to do so.

624
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,200
That was the primary currency of the realm at that time.

625
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
Little to do, you know, me and Ben both like got off to the to the AMV

626
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,800
mage made back in the day before we even knew who mage was.

627
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,720
Our paths cross much like Team Seven themselves.

628
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
We all we were we had a bond all this way back back in action.

629
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,600
But OK, to be fair to Sakura and, you know,

630
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,880
like Hinata doesn't get much development either.

631
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,720
But I think like people just shit on Sakura a lot more than they do

632
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,240
on Hinata for the same reasons.

633
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,200
And but do you think it's because Hinata has big tits and Sakura doesn't.

634
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,400
Big tits blinds you to all character flaws.

635
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,520
And it's I mean, that's part of it.

636
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,120
I mean, let's not fool ourselves.

637
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,360
That's definitely part of it.

638
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,920
It's anyway, I guess like it's a little and I think it's a little unfair.

639
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,080
I like Hinata just because the way she is.

640
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,680
I don't need her to be strong.

641
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,960
And I don't necessarily, I guess, need Sakura to be strong.

642
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,480
My issue with Sakura is her personality or was used to be her personality.

643
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,800
It probably changed since she was like 12 or something.

644
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,200
I don't even I don't even have like a quote unquote problem with her personality.

645
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,400
I just think it's so justified to just like Hinata more

646
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,920
because she's way more likable, generalist and does more interesting things.

647
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Hinata's got like a cooler power.

648
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,040
She's got that is it Ryuga clan?

649
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,120
Ryuga clan, Ryuga clan like the Biakugan, which is awesome.

650
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,120
And look, it's not anyone's fault that some people have magic powers inborn.

651
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,000
It's Kishimoto's fault for writing the series that way,

652
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,120
that some people are just way cooler than other people.

653
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,120
I kind of the thing that I kind of liked is like they had Rock Lee kind of like

654
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,880
overcoming that with pure effort.

655
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
And like they have this kind of setup with Sakura saying

656
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,000
like she wants to catch up to Naruto and Sasuke and like getting her training

657
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,440
kind of like sets that up, but it never really finishes.

658
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,280
Like it doesn't go anywhere.

659
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,080
Like she gets like stronger, but never to like the same degree.

660
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,000
And she never gets any moments like Rock Lee does.

661
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,320
And you're just like, you know what, I just realized.

662
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,920
And so and there's remember that moment where Rock Lee is fighting that bone guy

663
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,120
and like he's going to lose.

664
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,280
He tries the drunken technique.

665
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,680
It doesn't, you know, let him win.

666
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,280
And then Gara shows up and he's the one who defeats that bone guy.

667
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,160
And you know why?

668
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,160
You know what the key advantage Gara had over Rock Lee as we see later?

669
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,640
Rock Lee only had a dad who was like a weird deadbeat, the eternal

670
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,040
Ganyne or whatever.

671
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,040
But but fucking Gara had a loving mother who died loving him.

672
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,000
So it's the it's the advantage of a two parent household.

673
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,280
Gara is like Gara that pushed him over the edge.

674
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,440
Gara is like evil Harry Potter.

675
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
He's like evil Harry Potter because his mom died and gave him like magic protection.

676
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,040
That's true. Only it turned him into a fucking demon instead of.

677
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,200
Oh, it all worked out eventually.

678
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
And that was great.

679
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,120
OK, you want to know the thing.

680
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,240
OK, this is this is such a perfect example of the thing I hate most about

681
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,480
like writing in general, how like memes of characters can become more

682
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,080
than they were ever supposed to be.

683
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,320
And it's that, OK, we all know Gara.

684
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,280
Gara has like those really deep like black things around his eyes.

685
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,080
And like it's discussed in early Naruto, why that is.

686
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
He cannot sleep because he's possessed by a demon.

687
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,680
He like has terrible insomnia.

688
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,520
It gives him these like ridges around his eyes.

689
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,320
OK, Gara, this is the most retarded thing of all time.

690
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,440
It's when way later at the end of Shippuden, Gara's dad, like the third,

691
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,680
what do you call it, the Wind Kage, Kaze Kage gets revived or whatever.

692
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,520
Yeah, for like the final battle.

693
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,720
Like, of course, like we've seen with that guy looks like he looks like Gara,

694
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,040
but without the bags in his eyes, red hair, whatever.

695
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,680
And he fights with gold dust. OK, that's all fine.

696
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,040
But then he's like, oh, shit, I got a power up to fight my tongue, my fucking son.

697
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,080
Here I go, ninja art, like I power.

698
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,800
And he fucking activates like a ninja technique to get the like

699
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,720
black lines around his eyes, as if that's some sort of advantage.

700
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Wait, does this happen? I don't even remember this.

701
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm telling you right now.

702
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,680
I was just like six months ago.

703
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,000
Look like my son knows you.

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Was this cut from them?

705
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Fucking. No, what?

706
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
This can't be right. It's in there.

707
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,480
I'm telling you, at the very least, it's in the anime.

708
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,320
And I mean, I mean, I remember them saying that he has those because he can't sleep.

709
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,360
But like, I thought that later it was just like,

710
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,520
because, like, obviously he loses the demon later, too.

711
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,400
So why does he keep that?

712
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,920
That's my point. That was what I was wondering.

713
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,800
And I thought it was just like Naruto has like the marks on his face

714
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,320
because he has the demon fox.

715
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,400
So I figured I think he had those

716
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
when he was born before he had the demon in him, though.

717
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,280
That's that's so it's so fucking strange.

718
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,280
He was like put it in the right when he was born.

719
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,960
Things over his eyes.

720
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
And like that's because he's a raccoon, right?

721
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,080
It's the raccoon demon that he had.

722
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,480
So I was like, oh, it's like they have like facial markings to represent

723
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
the the the beast that they had.

724
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,200
And maybe that's what Kishimoto was going for with the initial design.

725
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,280
And then tried to justify it later or whatever.

726
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,400
It was dumb. It was stupid.

727
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,840
Yep. Keep your story straight.

728
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,200
Look at this fucking chud.

729
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,600
Look at this fucking look at this fucking Melvin.

730
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,520
Oh, yeah, that's him activating the secret art.

731
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
I power Garajutsu.

732
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,360
It's just a fucking consequence of insomnia.

733
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,040
That's not a real power.

734
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,840
See, and maybe insomnia is a power and we're all fools.

735
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
I mean, we're all wasting how many hours of our day.

736
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,680
All right, could be, you know, I'm going to stop sleeping and see if I get stronger

737
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,520
or report back next week.

738
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,160
It's just OK.

739
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,480
And for those who aren't obvious, this is an obvious.

740
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,880
It's just that like they just made like a character design trope into like a power

741
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,120
because I don't know.

742
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,760
It looks cool, I guess.

743
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,880
It doesn't even make sense. Epic.

744
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,760
Oh, it's simply because he looks like a boy band.

745
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,800
It's dumb.

746
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,280
But they do this shit all the time.

747
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,080
Mage and honestly, this is the exact same logic as where hockey came from in one

748
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,200
piece, like it is that same thing.

749
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,400
And you can do it better or worse.

750
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
Hockey is generally OK.

751
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,320
There's some problems with it, but it's this same thing that's happening here.

752
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,040
I'm trying to read the text in this these like series of screenshots that

753
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,400
Mage posted, but I'm just distracted by the fact that in the two close-ups

754
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,280
of Gara, his facial like proportions completely change.

755
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,760
And there was no reason you just recycle that frame.

756
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,040
It's very bizarre.

757
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,560
It is.

758
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,400
Well, what can you do?

759
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,280
Sometimes things are shit.

760
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,680
And by the way, I googled it.

761
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm like pretty sure Naruto had the lines on his face before he had the demon stuck in him.

762
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,120
But I could be wrong.

763
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,040
So I won't I won't die on that.

764
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,440
Didn't they put the thing in in like the moment he was born?

765
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,640
Yeah, I mean, no, very closely.

766
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
And there was some amount of time.

767
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Oh, OK, well, it's like a matter of like maybe an hour or two tops

768
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,240
because like he's born in secret because they have to like keep him locked away and shit

769
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,880
because they're and then immediately what's his face attacks them?

770
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
I forget everybody's names.

771
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
You know, it's all wait a minute.

772
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,640
You know what?

773
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,520
There is one thing that I think is maybe kind of reasonable.

774
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,720
Am I correct in in thinking that his mom was the genturiki of the Fox before him?

775
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,280
And OK, so the fact that the Fox was in up in his mom while he was born,

776
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,440
suddenly it seems a bit more reasonable.

777
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
He might have Fox markings on his face.

778
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,880
Because, you know, that's the real father.

779
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,560
The Fox is the father is my point.

780
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,400
So, OK, fair enough, at least half the father.

781
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,840
OK, that one's fine.

782
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,280
But this Garai shit is the most retarded thing I've ever seen in my life.

783
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,440
A blatant retcon or just ignoring your established canon.

784
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,960
It's not even a retcon.

785
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,320
It's simply a misunderstanding of his own series.

786
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,600
Oh, that makes me mad.

787
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,800
I remember fan art of Garai applying mascara like the emo boy that he was.

788
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,640
Yes, good one.

789
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,160
Thanks for the two thousands internet.

790
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,800
You shaped me into who I am today.

791
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,440
So, OK, we we've dismantled Naruto fundamentally at an ideological level.

792
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
What else is on the table?

793
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,160
Boys, well, everyone's telling me I got to get off Twitter.

794
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,720
And I should probably get off Twitter.

795
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,040
I mean, yeah, I can I can I recommend after this whole unpleasantness

796
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,720
with me and Digi and Mr.

797
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,440
Medicare, Mr. Medicare got involved.

798
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,880
Yeah, did you see what I tell this?

799
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,440
Should I tell this story a little bit?

800
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,160
It's an interesting story. It's amusing.

801
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,400
It's I feel I feel pretty you have to.

802
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
If you don't want to, we know it's fine.

803
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,160
I just I don't like how it went.

804
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't like how the tone of it evolved.

805
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,600
But like, OK, all right, I guess I got to talk about.

806
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,240
OK, you guys see that video that Medeker did about how the sausage is made?

807
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,360
It's horrible. I tried to watch it.

808
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,720
I could not sit through.

809
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,600
I mean, you know, it's don't know this video.

810
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,480
I mean, OK, it's it's terrible.

811
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,880
I always say that because surgery looks gross no matter what it is.

812
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,080
So that's not a criticism.

813
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,840
Yeah, I mean, it's an unpleasant video, no matter how you slice it.

814
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,960
But like, yeah, yeah, it's like a pretty long video of like graphics.

815
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,320
Like, like bottom surgery footage,

816
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,760
like people getting their dicks inverted and stuff.

817
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200
Oh, dear. And so it's that.

818
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,320
I want to watch that.

819
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,440
And and Medeker, he just like he just like snarks over the whole time.

820
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
Like, it's not educational.

821
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
It's for it's he's there to like make fun of it.

822
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,600
And it's really gross, like on every level.

823
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,800
And he got deep flat and he says drops the fucking N word like a bunch of times.

824
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,920
And it's I don't know why it's not it's not it's not even like a joke.

825
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,120
He just says it.

826
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,880
OK, he's fucking says it for no reason.

827
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,240
I it's yeah, OK, I don't like sure.

828
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,160
But he got deep platformed.

829
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,960
Did you didn't agree with him getting deep platformed, which is one thing.

830
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,560
But then he defended the video and I think the video is indefensible.

831
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,360
So I was like, no.

832
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,000
And then and then some shit happened.

833
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,480
And then also at the same time, coincidentally,

834
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,840
I made some comments on May's sexy Greta Thunberg, which I didn't really care for.

835
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,400
But then other people jumped into that conversation.

836
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,440
And that turned way uglier than I meant to say.

837
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,040
The worst thing about that conversation was some people said,

838
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,520
are you cosplaying sans with her blue hoodie?

839
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,440
Well, I was literally there cosplaying sans.

840
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,920
Yes, I had a black hoodie, but I was still sans.

841
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,720
That's the real crime being committed here.

842
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,800
It's a shame. What a shame.

843
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
Why don't you get in there?

844
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Why don't you get in the photo? I should have.

845
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,720
I should have called him out.

846
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,760
OK, but so but so.

847
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,920
So I say like this, you know, this.

848
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,640
Oh, God, how do the kind? It doesn't matter.

849
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,960
I mean, did you just agree?

850
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,760
Did you seem to get pretty annoyed with me over over this stuff?

851
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,120
There were some fairly strong accusations made.

852
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,160
I don't think I made any accusations that strong.

853
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,800
Somebody asked me.

854
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Somebody asked me, is Digi on the alt right pipeline?

855
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,440
And I thought the question was, is he on it?

856
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
Like, is he going down it?

857
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,680
And I think that Dick, I think that Dick Masterson is absolutely someone

858
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,200
who's part of the pipeline.

859
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,320
So I said, yes.

860
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,160
But it was interpreted.

861
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,320
I think the guy meant to ask is Digi part of the pipeline.

862
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,720
And I don't know. I don't I don't not sure.

863
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,080
So I. So that was that was dumb.

864
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,720
It wasn't dumb, but it was we were talking about two different things.

865
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,680
So there's certainly some degree of miscommunication

866
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
on exactly the nature of.

867
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
But did but did you got mad?

868
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,440
Did you got mad at me because he said that I would I would defend

869
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,360
Monkey Jones while I was while I would not do this.

870
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,480
Well, I would like attack like someone like

871
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,440
Medicare. And I was like, yeah, you know, I guess I guess it's it's true.

872
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,560
Monkey has some of the same problems here that I would object to.

873
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,480
Is he kind of the same?

874
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,360
And I said and I said that Dick Masterson,

875
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Medicare and Monkey are all cut from the same cloth.

876
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,240
They're all privileged popcorn, nihilists will hand wave away

877
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,240
problems that don't affect them personally.

878
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,040
And I think that's true.

879
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,960
And Medicare saw that and he

880
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,840
he made it his fucking Twitter bio,

881
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,600
but he didn't understand what I meant.

882
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,800
He didn't know the phrase popcorn nihilist,

883
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
as in Charlie Brown is a popcorn nihilist.

884
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,800
And he thought I was calling him privileged popcorn.

885
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,320
Like he thought that was the phrase I was trying to say.

886
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,080
And so he said he was like, I can't wait for the next

887
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
popcorn privilege party.

888
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,400
And I'm very upset.

889
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,360
I was misinterpreted, misunderstood.

890
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,200
I don't mind that he was like, make fun of my tweet.

891
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,200
But I'm but I do mind that he got it backwards

892
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,120
and is making fun of a misunderstood version of it.

893
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
I don't even understand.

894
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,960
Misunderstanding seems to seems to be the root of all your Twitter problems, Ben.

895
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,080
It's almost like everyone's Twitter problem doesn't allow for

896
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,120
for a great degree of clarity and communication.

897
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,960
I maybe maybe you shouldn't use it like that.

898
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,920
Then I don't know.

899
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,880
Popcorn nihilist, Ben, you just have to do it.

900
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
You just have to become a breadtuber.

901
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,040
Like you have like like you're just at that point.

902
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,240
You're just at that point as much as I don't even want to encourage it.

903
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,120
Like it's better to like have a video where you can actually explain your point

904
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,920
as opposed to going on these Twitter escapades that get literally nowhere.

905
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I guess so.

906
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,080
I mean, I mean, comparing the two things.

907
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,400
It's time to graduate from the new adventures of Winnie the Pooh analysis

908
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
into something truly evil.

909
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,240
Among the two, that's true.

910
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,640
And I'm sure it happens less.

911
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,960
But people can still pick and choose pieces of statements made and even

912
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,320
not like willfully misinterpret, but like people just inherently read

913
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,720
what they want to into what other people say and don't always, you know,

914
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,960
get down to the exact meaning the other person was saying or take a little clip.

915
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,200
And sure, maybe they legitimately only heard the little clip or something.

916
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,600
But then it sounds worse.

917
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,640
I just it's all bad.

918
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
It's all bad.

919
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,760
As a person who has long breaks from Twitter, I would highly recommend

920
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,480
to sometimes just take long breaks from Twitter.

921
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,720
It's not healthy.

922
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,760
Honestly, I feel a lot better from taking breaks like today.

923
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,440
I scroll through Twitter and, you know, I saw a lot of that Sakura Hinata discourse.

924
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,840
Like, who cares?

925
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,480
I wish I wish my time line had that on it.

926
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,160
That's much better than what I usually see when it comes to drama.

927
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
I mean, there's a lot of other stuff.

928
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,800
But I just like I just look at it.

929
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm like, oh, I don't want this anymore.

930
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,320
So I shut off Twitter and I want to play banished.

931
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,400
Understandable, understandable.

932
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,080
This is part of why I just decided a while ago.

933
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,680
I just I just am not I don't want to do this stuff.

934
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,440
So I pretty much just follow like anime girl accounts on Twitter.

935
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
That's pretty much all I follow.

936
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,640
Getting into arguments on Twitter is very pointless.

937
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,560
If you ask, it's very it's very pointless.

938
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,760
Nobody is understanding each other.

939
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,720
We're talking to each other if you want to.

940
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,880
If you're current, if the currency of your realm,

941
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,440
I don't know why I keep using that phrase, but like if the thing that you like

942
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,360
profit off of is like, I mean, if you're like, for example,

943
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,640
like a drama YouTuber or like a even like some kind of like political person

944
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,080
and people like and you have like an ideological bent and people just like

945
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,160
to see fighting going like seemingly, quote unquote, productive fighting

946
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,400
against the other side, not I mean, you know, but everybody does this.

947
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,120
Does engage this to any degree.

948
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,960
Like it's useful and beneficial to have more of that happening.

949
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,400
So you can capitalize on it.

950
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,920
Yeah, but that's not me every time.

951
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,720
Like I lose followers every time I get in an argument on Twitter,

952
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
like every single time.

953
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,400
If you really want to like discuss or argue with a person,

954
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,040
just like ask them if you can take it to DMs or add them on on on like

955
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,480
discord or something.

956
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,920
I don't know.

957
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,760
I just don't think Twitter is a good platform for arguing and everyone suffers for it.

958
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,200
You know, you know, a lot of I heard I heard quite a few people

959
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,560
shitting on you, Ben, for these things.

960
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,360
But I must say, I feel sympathetic because the nature of Twitter is so seductive.

961
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
Like, you know, I heard some people just being like, you know, why is Ben,

962
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,520
you know, like being a jerk about this thing?

963
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,760
But I just thought, well, I mean, he's just using Twitter as intended.

964
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,320
He's just saying the thing he thinks about the thing that was posted.

965
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,040
Is that not exactly the funny thing is that I don't really think that I said

966
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,320
anything all that inflammatory, except for maybe the pipeline thing,

967
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,400
which was I was I was misunderstood in what I was saying.

968
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Sure, that's exactly true.

969
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,120
Because like, I heard some people mad at like your response to May, for example.

970
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,320
And I just thought I actually looked at your message.

971
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,000
I was like, Ben seems pretty tepid here.

972
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,800
It doesn't seem particularly mean.

973
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,960
So yeah, I was just surprised that people were so.

974
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,160
I people like, why do you have things from the past?

975
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,000
But I just didn't seem that, you know, death.

976
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,800
I don't know.

977
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,440
OK, you can say how you want that that tweet was a month old.

978
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,240
But like, they had just discussed it on a podcast like a couple days before

979
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,720
and had been talking about that podcast recently, so it's not dragging up old shit.

980
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,720
It's not. Yeah, it's not.

981
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,480
It feels like if you're if you're just on Twitter, but if you watch that podcast,

982
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,040
as I did, like, I think the day this happened, I was like, ah,

983
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,000
I see where this discussion came from and it is not.

984
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
Yeah, I listen to it.

985
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,000
Shit. Yeah.

986
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,880
And I don't know.

987
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,240
We probably don't quite agree.

988
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,040
More of the story.

989
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,680
Follow everybody on everything.

990
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,240
Watch all the content and you'll always know exactly what's going on,

991
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,960
even if you don't want to.

992
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,360
Yeah, well,

993
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,200
there's just very annoyed, very annoyed about every every aspect of what

994
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,840
it's pretty funny that Twitter bills itself as a communication platform.

995
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,880
And yet it's the worst opposite.

996
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,480
It's like like more like the anti social network.

997
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,600
I'll say, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dude.

998
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,480
Got him.

999
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,400
Bravo.

1000
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,480
Shut it all down.

1001
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,240
Destroyed.

1002
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,320
Oh, dude, what if what if at the end of the movie, the social network,

1003
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
they like reveal that word was hidden there?

1004
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,600
Like, oh, like under a sign, there's like a piece of cardboard

1005
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,920
like falls and does that like swing off of it?

1006
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,200
You know, in front of the front of the sign out front of the building or whatever.

1007
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,800
OK, got him.

1008
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,840
Final note on that.

1009
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,640
Fuck, Mr. Medeker, he's a Nazi.

1010
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,560
There you go.

1011
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,400
A Nazi.

1012
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,760
I think he is definitely that word.

1013
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,520
Definitely.

1014
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,560
He's definitely he's a fascist who hates the Jews.

1015
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,120
OK, hang on.

1016
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,160
What if you are that but you don't you aren't willing to kill anyone?

1017
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,640
Is that still a Nazi?

1018
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,960
Yeah, yeah, I would say.

1019
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,560
As long as we're clear, I would say pretty much.

1020
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
I would say pretty much fair enough, fair enough.

1021
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,640
All right, good.

1022
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,720
Well, that's my story.

1023
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,800
I'm sure everyone has their own interpretation of events and whatnot.

1024
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,280
Also, this art of Hinata in different art styles is very cute.

1025
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,200
I like it, Mage.

1026
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,040
I've seen things like that recently.

1027
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,920
I like this idea way better.

1028
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,040
Yeah, it's good.

1029
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
Also, look at how can you not like Hinata?

1030
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,040
She's just she's just a lovely on the eyes.

1031
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,520
She's easy.

1032
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,560
She's easy to like.

1033
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,960
Yeah, she's designed.

1034
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,480
She's unchallenging.

1035
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,720
Unvirginally.

1036
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,960
She's the beloved Hinata.

1037
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,760
She's she's she's unclouded by normal cognition.

1038
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,800
You know what I'm talking about?

1039
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,840
You know what I'm referencing there?

1040
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,520
I don't.

1041
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,320
I don't know that one.

1042
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,600
Well, it's a spoiler, but in in Midsommar, there's a guy there, like,

1043
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,960
profit is like the guy who's like a product of inbreeding.

1044
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,600
And he's like all messed up and shit.

1045
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,840
And like, they have him like finger paint in a book and then they like

1046
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,520
interpret what the finger paintings mean.

1047
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,760
And they say that he's unclouded by normal cognition.

1048
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,840
So me and Munchy have been saying that all the time.

1049
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,520
My reference was I'm feeling so unclouded right now.

1050
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,720
What's his face?

1051
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,160
The Candyland guy for a Leonardo DiCaprio's character from Jango Unchained

1052
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,960
when he describes the old Joe Ben who was unclouded, no, unburdened by genius,

1053
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,640
unburdened by genius, shaved his daddy's straight razor for 50 years.

1054
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,040
And if it was him there, he would have cut his daddy's throat and it wouldn't

1055
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,840
have taken him no 50 years, neither.

1056
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,880
Great lines, great delivery, great characters.

1057
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,720
Task support of slavery.

1058
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,440
Man, we did it.

1059
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,600
This Joe Joe version.

1060
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,600
I don't like the Joe Joe ones.

1061
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,160
People always fuck up Joe Joe artwork.

1062
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,440
That's too. That's fucked up.

1063
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,120
That looks terrible. Yeah, it's not quite.

1064
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,920
It's not quite it, fam.

1065
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,920
Heels are just a little bit softer looking than that.

1066
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,400
Just a little bit.

1067
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,840
Oh, and this is not everybody fucks up Joe Joe art.

1068
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,000
And also it's people have a lot of trouble adapting to one piece art, too.

1069
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,920
Like this kind of looks like Hinata, but like, I mean, like just for example,

1070
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,360
like Nico Robin literally had Hinata's exact haircut.

1071
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,840
And yet this looks way worse than like Robin's because they give it

1072
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,920
like the rounded thing on the I don't know why they did that.

1073
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,400
They just thought that's what one piece characters look like, I guess.

1074
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,760
People fuck up one piece art so bad.

1075
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,560
It's hard to interpret someone else's art style perfectly.

1076
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,440
There are subtle.

1077
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,400
That's what we all need.

1078
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,880
Generic anime art style is the peak.

1079
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,680
We need to all convene the house style.

1080
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,360
If you type of drawing, I like the demon slayer one.

1081
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,520
I like the hair just like it all swishy.

1082
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,920
I like the My Hair Academia one.

1083
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,960
Yeah, they're both good.

1084
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,640
They're both good.

1085
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,720
I like the Dragon Ball Z one because it's purple.

1086
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,880
It's like literally just literally.

1087
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,200
No, she had purple hair and blue sometimes.

1088
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
So she changes.

1089
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
It's true.

1090
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,600
OK, what else is going on?

1091
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,080
I've got nothing. I'm out.

1092
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,600
I bought I bought games on the Black Friday sale.

1093
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,520
And one of them is, you know, Cooney, Raffa the White Witch.

1094
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,880
And they played. Oh, how is it?

1095
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,000
I've heard many things about it.

1096
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,280
It's so cute. I love it.

1097
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,840
There's so many puns and it's so whimsical.

1098
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,360
And I've been bothering Byter about how whimsy it is.

1099
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,560
And she's like, oh, so much.

1100
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
We did that too, right?

1101
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,520
But yeah, the first one.

1102
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,080
Yeah, yeah.

1103
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,240
And I actually bought the sequel on the PC as well because sales.

1104
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,240
And I've been wanting both.

1105
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,360
I didn't even open Steam on Black Friday.

1106
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,440
A small mercy.

1107
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I didn't even realize I granted myself.

1108
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,680
Oh, yeah, you know, that's smart.

1109
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,040
You know, I on Digi's recommendation, it wasn't a recommend,

1110
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,640
but like Digi in some podcast or something recently was just talking so

1111
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,320
glowingly about, he's like, every RPG sucks in the world lately,

1112
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,040
except for cross code.

1113
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,600
And I was like, oh, what's Digi likes in RPG that he found was like worth his time.

1114
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,280
What is that?

1115
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,000
That podcast was the content on Pokémon that you just posted a few days ago.

1116
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,360
That's that's correct.

1117
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,560
That's that you were on.

1118
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,920
I, you know, these things just they roll off my back.

1119
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,200
I can't remember anything.

1120
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,880
But I played that game.

1121
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,960
I've been playing it and probably five, six hours in.

1122
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,000
It's great. I fucking love it.

1123
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,120
It's fantastic.

1124
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,320
I've heard I was I was with Digi when I was playing it and I'm mad

1125
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,920
because he was like, all right, I'm going to play cross code.

1126
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,360
I'm going to devote like 80 hours to playing this game

1127
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,680
so I can be the first one to make a fucking massive video for I am games about it.

1128
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,520
I'm like, all right, cool, that's sick.

1129
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,440
And then he beat it.

1130
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,920
He's like, I don't feel like it.

1131
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,080
And I was like, you fucking didn't get 20 hours in and gave up.

1132
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,760
He gave up people are now hungry for more content.

1133
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,840
Jump. I do it.

1134
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,520
I played the cross code demo on like new grounds when it was new.

1135
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,640
Yeah, it was you ever play phenotopia?

1136
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
I don't know. I don't know.

1137
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,520
Phenotopia was like a site.

1138
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,120
It was sort of cave story-esque, but like not as actiony,

1139
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,600
but it was like a side scrolling action RPG.

1140
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,560
And it was it was it was like a new grounds release, like five or six,

1141
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,360
maybe more years ago.

1142
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,280
And just I played that and it was it was really great.

1143
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,320
And like the developer has been working on remaking it ever since for the last

1144
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,680
like six years. Oh my god. OK.

1145
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,200
And yeah, and also making the sequel like at the same time.

1146
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,080
And but just at that very moment,

1147
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,320
cross code also released its demo and I played it.

1148
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,520
And I didn't like it that much.

1149
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,680
I didn't care. I didn't see what the all the hype was.

1150
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,600
Yeah. Well, maybe it's evolved since then.

1151
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,240
OK, it's feel like it must have because like the demo I played was like very bare

1152
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,760
bones. Oh, this I mean, I would definitely say this is not bare bones.

1153
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,760
This is. Yeah. I mean, I feel like there's a lot going on.

1154
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,680
It's like, but I mean, you know, now's a good chance for me to talk about

1155
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,840
because I don't I don't maybe I'll make a video on it someday.

1156
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,640
But like it's it's got just such satisfying

1157
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,520
gameplay of it's it's 16 bit graphics.

1158
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,320
You're moving around this world.

1159
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,200
You're grinding. It's like every action you do.

1160
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,920
It's it's satisfying in the like the the like the egovania style.

1161
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,400
Or I don't know. I get like Secret of Mana kind of.

1162
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,320
We're running around.

1163
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,240
You're doing melee stuff.

1164
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,280
But you've also got this very satisfying long range combat that, to be honest,

1165
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,800
is a little hard to do with a thumbstick.

1166
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,880
It's a little bit imprecise.

1167
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,320
I feel like it maybe is better played with a with a mouse.

1168
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,400
But nonetheless, it it's really fun and you get party members are grinding.

1169
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,480
And there's this story that actually it's it's very much like a dot hack.

1170
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,920
That one dot hack show, there's like a million shows.

1171
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,560
But the one with that guy who's like in the world

1172
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,480
and they forget how Amnesia is like as a part of the narrative.

1173
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,000
But it's also very much it's like Greed Island.

1174
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,880
It's actually it's exactly like the Hunter Hunter Ark Greed Island

1175
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,120
that I just made a wee Agua about because it's about like a

1176
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,880
a real world place where people like warp in digital avatars to go explore.

1177
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,600
Like kind of in a in a kind of like in Avatar, the movie, how you like

1178
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,000
are to your consciousness like in Bade, something else you can possess or whatever.

1179
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,760
And you play as like a magical avatar sword art online.

1180
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,200
Well, only this is a real space or online's digital.

1181
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,400
But but nonetheless, it's super cool.

1182
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,320
And like it's got this this is the real hook.

1183
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,160
This is the real hook.

1184
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,680
It's just that you start the game, you get these mechanics, but there's a big

1185
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,360
there's the big hook I have as a player is just that at the very you're told

1186
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,080
that you start off with like normal like a normal neutral attacks

1187
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,640
that don't have any elemental properties.

1188
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,440
But like the main quest is to go and collect like the four elemental things

1189
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,960
kind of like Final Fantasy style, but like they actually give 10 like tangible

1190
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,680
gameplay bonuses because each new like elemental thing you get

1191
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,040
augments, your fighting like permanently, or it's just like a new

1192
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,320
it's kind of like a new beam you get in Metroid or whatever.

1193
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,440
You can just like activate them and you switch between them.

1194
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,000
And just like the aspect of being on a quest where I know I'm going to get

1195
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,720
like new ways to play and like new powers I'll be able to use in like creative

1196
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,480
ways against enemies with like elemental weaknesses and stuff.

1197
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,640
And the game like looks so good and is great.

1198
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,040
I don't know.

1199
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,360
The dialogue isn't like amazing or anything, but I don't know.

1200
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,480
The world's it's good enough.

1201
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,120
It's just it's everything about it just feels so appealing on just like on a

1202
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,800
gameplay level and the story is also pretty cool too.

1203
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,200
So I'm just I'm way into it.

1204
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,480
What do you describe me with the, you know, you know, you play you unlock

1205
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,920
more powers and stuff like that.

1206
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,760
Like that's just like most RPGs aren't aren't isn't it?

1207
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,880
It's just like it's different because this is actually, you know what?

1208
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,680
You're right.

1209
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,960
It's like it's like a fundamental thing, but it's really presented it in a

1210
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,720
very appealing way and they feel like really big landmarks and big

1211
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,240
achievements and I don't know.

1212
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,800
It's hard to describe, but just the way it's presented seems very, it's

1213
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,600
very appealing and very satisfying to pursue.

1214
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,200
I mean, like in a lot of RPGs, you just sort of unlock it on level up and stuff.

1215
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,320
Like, but if it's like, exactly, and I guess it's sort of neat, it's more

1216
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,880
satisfying.

1217
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,440
It's pretty Zelda like and stuff, but it just I'm watching the trailer and

1218
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,080
it looks like there's way more going on here.

1219
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,720
Also, there's a, there's a Saitama in it.

1220
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,760
I posted a screenshot in the thing in the chat.

1221
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,360
Oh, did you?

1222
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,480
Uh, let me see.

1223
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,880
A gross disgusting audio files.

1224
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,680
Oh, yeah.

1225
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,000
That's true.

1226
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,880
There he is.

1227
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,280
It's it's a indie game.

1228
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,000
So there's, you know, there's memes.

1229
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,760
There's I don't not like the portrait art style.

1230
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,680
The art is not amazing.

1231
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,560
You're absolutely right.

1232
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,480
It is not amazing.

1233
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,600
The sprites are nice though.

1234
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,520
So I'm just the little sprites are fine.

1235
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,000
How can you fuck those up?

1236
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:23,680
I like that.

1237
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,160
I sort of like all gets in tight.

1238
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,160
Thank you.

1239
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,400
I like the, I like the portrait of the girl though.

1240
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,880
It's fine enough.

1241
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,200
It has extra shading inside.

1242
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,960
Look, the story, the characters, the art, it's all bullshit.

1243
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,440
Who cares?

1244
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,000
The point is, it's a really satisfying game to play.

1245
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,200
And I'm having a great time.

1246
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,360
That's, that's satisfying games.

1247
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,120
Other than, you know, also, I bought Divina your drills and two, which

1248
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,600
I've been craving to buy for a while and I did.

1249
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
I only played a little bit.

1250
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,640
I just got off the ship and I barely did anything.

1251
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,800
But I stole eight buckets or I rather I took eight buckets.

1252
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,880
I put one on my head.

1253
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
It's a helmet now.

1254
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,480
Wait, what is this?

1255
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,280
Divina your drills and two.

1256
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,640
I, I, I, I, I regret not taking the skill to talk to animals

1257
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,120
because I missed out on talking to sheep, to two sheep and one squirrel

1258
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,240
riding a skeleton cat.

1259
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,280
So sex to be me.

1260
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,960
There's definitely a story there for sure.

1261
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,640
There's, yes.

1262
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,520
Maybe next time.

1263
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,040
It's fun.

1264
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,800
It's pretty fun.

1265
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,160
I hate the fact that the way you control the camera is a little bit clunky

1266
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,880
and it takes getting used to because I'm used to like moving the

1267
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,800
camera around with my right mouse button, but no, that's not how you do it.

1268
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,720
I have to assign a different button.

1269
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,240
I mean, like, I think there's a default button.

1270
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,480
Yeah, there's a default button, but I signed it to a different button

1271
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,120
just because it's more comfortable for me to have it on the mouse.

1272
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,760
But it's still, it's still just so, so annoying.

1273
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,080
If I forget how to do it, I just mess up the camera work.

1274
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,560
But thankfully it's a trend based game.

1275
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,400
So if I get into a battle, I don't, I'm not losing out on any time

1276
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,400
to readjust my camera and stuff.

1277
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,160
And I'm not like the old RPGs of like, like Baldur's Gate and stuff, right?

1278
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,440
He thinks I haven't played Baldur's Gate, so I wouldn't know.

1279
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:18,040
But yeah, it's very, it's very RPG, like with with nice enough graphics

1280
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,720
and not super quality ones.

1281
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,280
But I mean, they're good enough.

1282
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,880
They're quite neat.

1283
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,760
There's a skeleton dude that I may or may not romance.

1284
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,760
Who knows?

1285
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,680
I am a tall elf lady.

1286
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,080
I'm glad to see the flash to gain the memories of the dead, which is really cool.

1287
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,640
I just like that comic Chew.

1288
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,520
It's just Chew. No, no, no.

1289
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,120
He has no he can he's like a detective who can like eat something.

1290
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,080
And if he eats something, he can like it's sort of like Bruce Willis

1291
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,720
and unbreakable.

1292
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,960
He can just sort of like sense like where a thing was.

1293
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,360
And if he has to eat something to get it's like not its memories,

1294
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,640
but like its history.

1295
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,360
I think I've seen the concept thrown around.

1296
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,000
But yeah, like with these elves, the one elf I met on the ship,

1297
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,800
she all like she's a lot better at telling like reading memories of people.

1298
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,400
So like all she had to do was like my arm and you can let her look

1299
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
or your arm or not.

1300
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,960
And I let her let her look my arm and she could tell memories

1301
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,000
from my character's past, apparently.

1302
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,880
So that's neat. I like it.

1303
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,080
I like that's cool.

1304
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,920
Yeah, I accidentally became a slave to a red lizard.

1305
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,520
But I hate when that happens.

1306
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,640
Yeah, but I met up with him afterwards

1307
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,400
and he was like, I never mind being the slave.

1308
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,160
You saved me, so you earned your freedom.

1309
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,800
So I was like, OK, cool.

1310
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,560
You know, I happen to watch that.

1311
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,680
What's his fucking like Seth Cezniak or whatever that fucking YouTube guy

1312
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,840
with the weird name.

1313
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,560
I watched his video on Vampire, the Masquerades.

1314
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,120
You guys ever play that game because it looked pretty dope.

1315
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,480
I played the online one when I was younger.

1316
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,880
I tried playing it, but my computer couldn't run it.

1317
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,120
But it was kind of fun, but I didn't understand anything.

1318
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,200
I was just too stupid, I guess.

1319
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,480
It seems like a fairly large brain game.

1320
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,240
It was.

1321
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,320
I remember people talking about one of the Vampire Girls looking

1322
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,160
sort of like a trashy Harley Quinn version or something.

1323
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,880
Yes, that's right. That's right.

1324
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,040
There's a new there's a sequel of that game coming out.

1325
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,120
It's in there.

1326
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,040
They're working on it now.

1327
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,800
Yeah, but people are pretty, pretty hyped as I understand it.

1328
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,600
Right, right.

1329
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,120
It was sort of on sale the game, but wasn't on a big enough sale

1330
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,240
for me to justify buying the Masquerade game.

1331
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,000
Well, perhaps what I was just curious

1332
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,320
if you guys played this.

1333
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,120
Seth is a big fan, as it seems.

1334
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,320
I liked it.

1335
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,960
Yeah, I like I remember.

1336
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,000
I remember liking it.

1337
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,080
I just don't remember anything other than anything else about it.

1338
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,680
Well, that's it.

1339
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
That's that's my whole thought on that matter.

1340
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,560
Philosophy Tube.

1341
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,640
Philosophy Tube just did a video.

1342
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,920
It's really good.

1343
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,520
It's about I guess it's it's about the video game industry,

1344
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,880
but it's in particular about like the work of Jim Sterling.

1345
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,640
Yeah, I saw that thumbnail and you just dressed up as him.

1346
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,160
It's very interesting.

1347
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,240
Yeah, it's good.

1348
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,320
It's about how like it's about how like the tendency toward monopoly

1349
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,160
in in particular in the video game industry can can let like companies

1350
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,680
like basically buy their way out of the supposed advantages

1351
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,160
offered by the the free market.

1352
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,520
Monopolies of which companies?

1353
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,880
The developers or the distributors or publishers, right?

1354
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,080
Both, I guess.

1355
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Wherever the money is.

1356
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,880
I know just Jim Sterling usually has issues with publishers

1357
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,720
more than anything else.

1358
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,480
That's like his go to to make money.

1359
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,080
I would think so.

1360
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,120
Piss off the publishers, which is usually justified.

1361
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,440
Not the developers, in particular, so much.

1362
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,960
OK, OK.

1363
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,480
You know, stuff like loot boxes and what I say,

1364
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,600
though, what ways that like like like moves that the video game

1365
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,360
industry makes towards like extracting more value without

1366
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,120
providing a better product or like providing a service to more people

1367
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,200
or anything like that. Sure.

1368
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,760
I think we can all get behind that.

1369
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,400
And the rent the rent to your economy where you make money

1370
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,720
not by producing anything, but just by owning something,

1371
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,040
whether it's like a building that you rent or just like intellectual

1372
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
property rights that you just have.

1373
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,000
I'm sending a certain ideological bent to to some of these points.

1374
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,040
No, no kidding.

1375
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,160
All right.

1376
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,840
Well, I mean, those those are those are good things to talk.

1377
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,320
I mean, fucking, I wish that I was just thinking about a game

1378
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,320
that Oh, Metal Gear Rising, too.

1379
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,200
Metal Gear Revengeance will never get made because Konami has

1380
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,560
the fucking lockdown on and I mean, there's nothing to be done.

1381
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,120
Sometimes I think about that and I die a little bit more inside every time.

1382
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,920
I yeah, yeah, you know, I just saw a guy on 4chan who just had a thread

1383
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,560
with a picture of of Jack about to let her rip.

1384
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,840
I just beat Revengeance.

1385
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,760
Wasn't it sick?

1386
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,640
Wasn't it sick?

1387
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,920
It it was sick.

1388
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,000
It was dope. And you know what? I was I didn't expect to.

1389
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,880
But the senator was making.

1390
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,320
OK, dude, don't say he was making some strong red pill.

1391
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,640
Is it not?

1392
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,840
He was making some good points and many terrible ones.

1393
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,280
I mean, surely, you know, this is a sure reason.

1394
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah, sure. You got a pepper is some true some truth in there.

1395
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,720
Of course.

1396
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,600
Like his the whole premise of this thing was like, I want America

1397
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,400
and Americans to be great again from the war economy and to be free

1398
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,760
to fight for things they believe in, not be slaves of this like weird,

1399
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,880
fucked up, you know, fucking thing where they're fighting for values.

1400
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,000
They don't give a shit about it.

1401
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,320
They don't understand what it's basically like a criticism of neoliberalism.

1402
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
I understand as I understand it.

1403
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,280
But like I'm noticing that we saying is we want this for Americans

1404
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,080
and we will start wars to get there.

1405
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,320
Fuck everybody else.

1406
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,760
Well, OK, I mean, I don't know if I'm for starting many, many wars

1407
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,120
for the benefit of the Americans that survive at the end of the day.

1408
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,000
Is the idea is the idea that just America's got to like fucking

1409
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,000
conquer everything so we don't have to fight anymore?

1410
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,160
Is that the plan?

1411
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,160
I'm not going to lie.

1412
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,080
I need to see it again to fully digest his point because I he makes

1413
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,440
this rousing speech while he's beating the shit out of you.

1414
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,480
So there's a couple of things going on in the scene at once.

1415
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,440
I was I get the feeling that he's just like Luffy.

1416
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,440
He's just like, you know, the the like the king of the pirates

1417
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,200
is the is the one who's the most free.

1418
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,240
So America's got to be king of the pirates.

1419
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,840
I mean, he comes in and and you know, Ryden's fighting him

1420
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,280
and Ryden's like, oh, I know what you're up to, Senator.

1421
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,080
Like you're a selfish crook politician, just like everybody else.

1422
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,000
You just want to like start war to personally profit off of it.

1423
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,040
And then Armstrong comes.

1424
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,400
He's like, no, no, no, foolish child.

1425
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,680
You don't understand anything like he actually has sincere beliefs.

1426
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,920
But his sincere beliefs are like, first of all, you know,

1427
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,880
he literally says make America great again.

1428
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,200
It's fucking insane.

1429
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,640
The best the best moment in that epic in video games.

1430
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,720
Oh, my God, Trump ever fucking around.

1431
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,480
I mean, I think Reagan had said it.

1432
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,880
So like maybe they lifted from Reagan or whatever. It doesn't matter.

1433
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,880
No, he never said make America great.

1434
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,400
And that's why Trump used make America great again.

1435
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,280
It was like a callback.

1436
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,040
I'm sure someone in the past used the phrase make America great.

1437
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,040
I was just wondering if this was lifting something.

1438
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,760
It was Senator Armstrong, the legend.

1439
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,280
All right, of course.

1440
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,080
So what was the point I was making?

1441
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,520
Just so like Ryden assumes he's just an evil corrupt politician.

1442
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,000
Like in actuality, it's a bit more complicated.

1443
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,560
The senator, he actually wants like America to be free.

1444
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,680
He actually does seem to have this like libertarian mindset.

1445
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,080
He wants to be king of the pirates.

1446
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,400
I assume because free.

1447
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,880
Yeah, because he doesn't want to.

1448
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,640
He's he's not a fascist.

1449
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,160
He's just willing to engage in war to like destroy.

1450
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,720
He wants to like break down America.

1451
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,880
He I guess you'd call it accelerationism or whatever.

1452
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,440
He wants massive wars to like just to literally drain the swamp

1453
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,080
and shatter like the current existing status quo

1454
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,040
and then impose, as I understand it, like basically a narco capitalism

1455
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,400
or something where people are just on their own.

1456
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,280
Like the weak will be subjugated by the strong

1457
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,080
because that's how it should be, you know, things, things of this nature.

1458
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,880
OK, I see. I see. Yeah, that's some some randy and shit.

1459
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah, pretty much, pretty much. Yeah.

1460
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,040
And you know what? There's a lot of appeal.

1461
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,480
There's a lot of appeal.

1462
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,400
Epic. Like a banana.

1463
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,400
There's a lot of appeal going on here.

1464
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,920
See, Ben, it all works out for you

1465
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,000
because Ryden like slices his chest open and crushes his still beating heart

1466
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,800
as you was like it to be. It was fucking sick.

1467
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,720
It was fucking dope.

1468
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,200
I have seen I like I don't really

1469
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,800
I'm not a metal gear guy.

1470
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,360
I've like barely played any metal.

1471
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,680
So I haven't played Revengeance,

1472
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,960
but I've seen Matthew Matosis's video about Revengeance.

1473
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,360
So I know about the battle with Armstrong and it does look sick.

1474
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,960
Oh, you know, some people were saying that like Nate,

1475
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,120
a lot of people think this is the best final boss of all time.

1476
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,160
Like, what do you think?

1477
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,520
And I was like, it's definitely up there.

1478
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,640
I still, you know, Zemnas and Kmartz, too.

1479
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,640
What can I say?

1480
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,360
I mean, I mean, Armstrong is cool as hell.

1481
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,080
Yeah, no doubt. No fucking doubt.

1482
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,400
He is undeniably a bad man.

1483
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,840
I mean, after this point, he's just a fucking politician

1484
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,280
who then you think is just piloting a metal gear.

1485
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,560
But no, he's also a nanomachine powered monster, man.

1486
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,880
I was so happy.

1487
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,960
I played that game way late, but I didn't spoil myself on anything.

1488
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,280
So all of it was just like pure fucking hype.

1489
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,520
Holy shit.

1490
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,040
The amazing fucking cheesy line when Jack's like, you know, it's like,

1491
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,040
you know, I thought my sword was a tool for justice, but I might have been wrong.

1492
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,920
Besides, this isn't my sword.

1493
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,240
And I was like, oh, that's a great fucking line.

1494
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,040
Do this shit.

1495
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,560
That's a great fucking line. Oh, my God.

1496
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,640
You know, Ben, there's one other point.

1497
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,120
Speaking of one piece, as we were saying before, I was curious.

1498
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,520
Here, I'm going to post an image that apparently this came afterward,

1499
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,920
but I can't help but feel like there are a lot of similarities

1500
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,400
between like hockey in general and like the senator.

1501
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,520
Now, I don't know which came from which.

1502
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,560
Doesn't he turn his arms black with his whole body becomes black at various points.

1503
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,680
And my boy Virgo here is just, first of all, problematic black face,

1504
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,000
not appreciating that Virgo.

1505
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,800
Although I still argue he's black.

1506
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,600
I appreciate it.

1507
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,360
And I'm just saying, there's a lot of similarities between these two characters.

1508
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,320
And I believe one piece did invent hockey first,

1509
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,600
like a couple of years before Revengeance came out.

1510
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,280
So I'm wondering if perhaps Revengeance decided to crib a little bit from one piece.

1511
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,200
I don't know.

1512
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:36,840
I don't know.

1513
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,840
These things are fairly similar.

1514
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,440
I'll never know.

1515
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,000
I mean, I'll never know.

1516
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,360
I saw who was it?

1517
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,400
There was a, it wasn't Renegade cut.

1518
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,960
It was super bunny hop.

1519
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,640
Super bunny hop made a video.

1520
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,600
I was rewatching some super bunny.

1521
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,080
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1522
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,760
Just look at this.

1523
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,720
You might not like it, but this is what peak male form looks like.

1524
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,560
Fuck yeah, Virgo.

1525
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,600
Oh my God.

1526
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,920
What a legend.

1527
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,640
He's beautiful.

1528
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,280
He's nice.

1529
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,440
He needs to hang out with Tagorell immediately.

1530
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,240
They would be bros forever.

1531
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,880
Bundle.

1532
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,800
He's just a big bundle of ropes.

1533
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:11,840
That's correct.

1534
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,440
Also, he got so much bigger.

1535
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,880
It's just just for comparison sake.

1536
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,040
Look at him in the manga.

1537
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,600
Like he's he's still huge, but not on this level in the in the fucking anime.

1538
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,400
Well done, boys.

1539
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:22,880
Well done.

1540
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,760
I'm glad they dial it up to 11.

1541
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,480
That's incredible.

1542
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:26,960
Me too.

1543
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,960
But the super bunny hop did a video about

1544
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,640
Evangelion and Metal Gear Solid.

1545
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:32,880
Yeah.

1546
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,280
And, you know, there's a bunch to say about that.

1547
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,200
But like in particular, like, like Evangelion is like culturally ubiquitous over there.

1548
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,160
It's like it's like known in the way that like Star Wars is is is like widely known over here,

1549
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:45,920
which is incredible.

1550
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,800
I didn't I didn't really know that it was like to that extent.

1551
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,120
But I imagine one piece is probably like kind of the same.

1552
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,080
Like everybody knows one piece at least to a degree.

1553
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,080
They'll know Luffy.

1554
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,320
They'll know Chopper probably.

1555
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:57,840
Things like that.

1556
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1557
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,320
Yeah. So like I'd be I'd be kind of it wouldn't be surprising

1558
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,440
if like some concepts from one piece had bled into someone like someone like

1559
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,800
Oh, fuck, what's the what's the Metal Gear Solid guy's name?

1560
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,240
Raiden Raiden.

1561
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,280
No, the guy Kojima Kojima.

1562
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,800
Yeah, it wouldn't be surprising if some had bled into it.

1563
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,720
Like just from such like a hugely popular, culturally ubiquitous.

1564
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah, it's not crazy to think.

1565
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,160
And he's the kind of guy like like Metal Gear Solid is a fucking cultural

1566
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,600
mishmash that he just made up from shit that he'd seen like like any work of art is.

1567
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,040
Did you know that out of every five Japanese citizens,

1568
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,320
one of them has a one piece podcast?

1569
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:42,720
You know, it's just, you know, the podcast is just is just wrote daily life over there.

1570
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,360
So much. Yeah, there's you'll never run out of content to consume.

1571
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,160
Learn Japanese right now.

1572
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,600
It's wise, it's wise. Yeah.

1573
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,640
What?

1574
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,560
Munchie just called me.

1575
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,640
Munchie.

1576
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,440
Why did he call you?

1577
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,200
Munchie, if you have time to call back, you have time to be on the podcast.

1578
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,520
Into the show, why don't you?

1579
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,760
Yeah, disgusting.

1580
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,800
Well, he's typing.

1581
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,400
Let's let's let's let's get an explanation for this.

1582
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,840
Yeah, OK, well, I mean, I'll be happy.

1583
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,320
You don't have to say.

1584
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,240
But we don't have to wait for I don't know how long it'll be.

1585
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,080
We could go to the fucking.

1586
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,120
The whole novel.

1587
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Oh, yeah, voicemails.

1588
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,880
I mean, I got we've only got a couple here.

1589
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,840
But there's I think there's four total today.

1590
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,280
So not nothing, nothing too brutal.

1591
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,320
Yeah, all right, fuck you guys.

1592
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,760
We're good. Go to voicemails.

1593
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,200
I'm ready. Good, good.

1594
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,920
OK, let me see.

1595
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,480
Of course, everybody leave down below in the description.

1596
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,880
There's a link to the speak pipe.

1597
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,080
Leave us voicemails so we can play them on the show if they are of a quality

1598
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,720
persuasion. OK, let's let's go to first one.

1599
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,120
First up is let me see.

1600
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:45,840
Oh, yes, here we go.

1601
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,200
This is the no nut November comrade as in comrade.

1602
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,280
But C U M sends message to enemy Comers.

1603
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,720
OK, it's December 1st today.

1604
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,720
So the walls are splattered white across the nation, across the world.

1605
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,240
So let's let's see what he has to say for himself.

1606
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,200
30 of November 2019.

1607
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,440
T minus seven hours till the big nut.

1608
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,200
In a couple of hours, I will finally complete.

1609
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,360
No, not November and show all of you disgusting comers.

1610
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,880
That's how superior I am.

1611
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,880
It shows my willpower is so fucking strong

1612
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,440
that I can resist the urge to nut.

1613
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:37,640
You disgust me, you lowly peasants, who cannot handle your dick.

1614
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,600
You cannot handle to not handle your little dicks.

1615
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,240
Fuck off, die, Comers.

1616
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,600
I can't handle the responsibility.

1617
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,160
Damn, got me good.

1618
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,280
Oh, thank God.

1619
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,160
No, not November's over today.

1620
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,120
When we are recording this.

1621
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,280
Indeed, indeed.

1622
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:53,920
It feels good.

1623
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,800
I am sure this the our mighty comrade here has done just fine

1624
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,280
and is currently enjoying the fruits of his life.

1625
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Yes, congratulations, sir.

1626
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,080
Bless bless.

1627
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,080
All right, that's that.

1628
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,240
Blessed be.

1629
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,120
Let's go to the next one.

1630
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:08,520
What do we got?

1631
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,400
This is OK.

1632
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:10,760
I don't know.

1633
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,280
I don't actually know what this stands for.

1634
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,640
Any idea what it's called?

1635
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,880
U G W G E girl.

1636
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
No united gamers with girlfriends.

1637
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,320
I don't know.

1638
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,040
Maybe it's a Gwee, a Gwee E girl, a Gwee.

1639
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,720
I see, you know, I just don't know.

1640
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,760
OK, well, let's come clear.

1641
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,840
I don't know.

1642
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,520
OK, here we go.

1643
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,280
And here they go play.

1644
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,160
So I had a girl who was a big tinny got girlfriend.

1645
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,280
And she says, I should drink more.

1646
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,280
My own do tells me I should say the N word more.

1647
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,080
Who trash talks and gets in deep with face clan.

1648
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,840
One day, the 360 no scope silent shot her.

1649
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,760
She's in MLG.

1650
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,080
Quick scoping montage is all over the internet.

1651
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,040
I just want to see your game again.

1652
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:08,160
I just want to let her know that I don't care that she got pwned.

1653
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,680
So I joined the public lobby and go AFK.

1654
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,360
So my Katie ratio drops.

1655
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,600
And you know what?

1656
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,680
She calls me a noob.

1657
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,320
She unfriends me on Xbox Live.

1658
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,600
Now I see the full set.

1659
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,120
Now I'm always saying the N word, Nick.

1660
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,200
He finally sees the sunny side.

1661
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,720
I mean, wait, the funny side of life.

1662
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,000
Right. Right. Yeah, good.

1663
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,680
I've I've learned my new favorite euphemism is the gamer word.

1664
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,520
Yes. Yeah, that's good.

1665
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,920
I learned that recently.

1666
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,560
And sometimes you have a gamer moment

1667
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,520
when you say the gamer word happens to the best of us.

1668
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,360
What what is OK?

1669
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,840
What exactly is an e girl?

1670
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,400
Is it just a girl, you know, on the internet?

1671
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,000
I would argue it's a more specific thing than that.

1672
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,800
Like it's I mean, I thought that it was like a Titty streamer

1673
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,320
or like a like a male is a celeb.

1674
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,240
Right. I would think it's merely defamatory

1675
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,160
to just call any girl online an e girl.

1676
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,400
That doesn't seem. I thought it was like there's no distinction.

1677
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,840
We had some sort of like presence

1678
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,040
or trying to do something on the internet.

1679
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,960
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1680
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,520
Like you're not just on the internet.

1681
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,680
That's passively.

1682
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,840
Nate, Nate, you're trying to have an urban dictionary.

1683
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,200
Yes, she's right. Oh, you're right.

1684
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,520
She's right. Let's let's go.

1685
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,600
Why guess from the beginning?

1686
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,520
Well, because I thought it was like a female e celeb.

1687
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,480
But then I feel like people toss the word around

1688
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,040
in a way that it just means any girl on the internet.

1689
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,080
You know, I think it's it's kind of a nebula.

1690
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,760
Or it's got fuzzy and I just like everything on social media.

1691
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,360
It has multiple definitions, depending on who you are.

1692
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,440
OK, well, here's the top one on Urban Dictionary.

1693
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,040
E girl. Finally, we've got the authority way.

1694
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,080
And OK, here we go.

1695
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,000
E girl, an e girl is a species of emo usually found on TikTok.

1696
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,640
No, but commonly spends time on Tumblr.

1697
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,040
All right. I don't give a shit about the definition.

1698
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,360
I don't know what an adult has to say on the matter.

1699
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,400
I mean, you commonly found doing the me, me, me, meme dance,

1700
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,880
but has probably never seen it before.

1701
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,240
OK, some of these things do not have to be emo to be an e girl.

1702
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,760
OK, all right. Let's go to definition two here.

1703
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,400
This second definition is better, I think.

1704
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,920
OK, here we go. So definition one of section two here is OK.

1705
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,520
E girls are usually girls who play games online

1706
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,240
and can be found on either Twitter or Discord.

1707
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,200
They send nudes slash thirst traps or even sell them.

1708
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,080
They can also be found on Twitch.

1709
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,040
But the difference between a normal girl who plays video games

1710
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,200
and an e girl. OK, good.

1711
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,000
To make the distinction is that an e girl begs for money

1712
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,880
or sells herself for it.

1713
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,680
You can theoretically beg for money and not be an e girl.

1714
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,760
But if you're like selling sexy picks, that's definitely e girl.

1715
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,560
That seems much closer to my general understanding of I've seen.

1716
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,680
I've seen Discord servers

1717
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,960
like say that like we have e girls in our Discord server as like a selling point.

1718
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,120
But it sounds like a derogative.

1719
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,080
Yeah, I mean, I thought it was going to be a negative like stay away.

1720
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,400
We've got e girls in our ranks.

1721
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,840
Don't come in here, boys. Protect.

1722
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,360
No, like when I when I went on like various

1723
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,960
there are sites that like you can like search and find

1724
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,000
Discord servers on and I put endless war on a couple of them.

1725
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,480
Like, just to know Ben was googling how to meet.

1726
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,280
Someone tell me I saw and I would see the term ego.

1727
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,640
So I was like, like join our server.

1728
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,480
You know, we're a we're a cute, comfy community community based server.

1729
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,800
You know, we got custom roles.

1730
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,600
We got e girls. We got e boys.

1731
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,360
And I'm like, do we want those things?

1732
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,800
Are those good things? I don't.

1733
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,720
What? What's what's what happened?

1734
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,320
It depends on the perspective.

1735
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,440
But I'll be spending my evenings at the opera.

1736
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,440
Thank you. Not on your Discord server.

1737
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,640
I think when you call a girl and you girl,

1738
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,440
usually you could be taking as a bad thing to be called.

1739
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,560
But some people just wear it was unless you're pro slut.

1740
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,320
Pro slut.

1741
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,320
It really depends on the perspective and the person.

1742
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,560
We call it we call it sex positive.

1743
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,960
These days, you're right.

1744
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,240
I prefer my ancient term pro slut.

1745
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,840
But yeah, you're right. You're right.

1746
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,640
I don't know. It's open to interpretation.

1747
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,400
If you like it, great.

1748
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,280
Well, as a father or a mother,

1749
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,240
would you want your daughter to be an e girl?

1750
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,120
Perhaps that's the operative question to ask.

1751
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,680
Probably not in the strictest definition of the term.

1752
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,520
No, indeed, indeed.

1753
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,200
Oh, but, you know, like, you know, I was thinking that, like,

1754
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,840
if someone if like a girl is in a,

1755
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,160
you know, these, these Discord chat girls will come in there

1756
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,680
and they'll they'll start to throw around some oo-woos.

1757
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,160
They'll start to throw around some oh woes.

1758
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,840
Yeah, you know what they're doing.

1759
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,720
They're baiting me. I can't resist an oo-wooh.

1760
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,680
Especially capitalized, bolded, italicized.

1761
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,800
I'm putty in their hands.

1762
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,440
And this is female power and frankly, it's toxic.

1763
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,280
It has to be changed.

1764
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,800
Mages oolooing right now.

1765
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,120
It's not oolooing, it's nyoron.

1766
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,320
Okay, that's the I apologize.

1767
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,360
That's a whole other level.

1768
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,640
Mages advanced here.

1769
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,400
I'm not even ready to face that kind of demon.

1770
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,680
You know, I just thought I'd play this one briefly

1771
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,520
as an example.

1772
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,480
This seemed like a good voicemail,

1773
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,640
but just listen to how unintelligible this voicemail is

1774
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,400
from the ghost of scumbag, Chris.

1775
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,520
If you want to go listen to it,

1776
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,920
it's on the fucking SoundCloud.

1777
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,960
Just give this a listen for one second.

1778
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,200
Oh, oh shit, it didn't work.

1779
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,040
Wait, hang on.

1780
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:21,880
This is pretty bad.

1781
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,720
I got it, I got it.

1782
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,560
Okay.

1783
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,400
Totally in auto.

1784
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,240
Go.

1785
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,760
I just wanted to point out

1786
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,680
that personally, if you're applying for this November,

1787
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,760
it will only become the 20th of November.

1788
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,600
See, can you make out any of this?

1789
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,440
Hmm.

1790
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,280
I see the problem.

1791
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,120
Bits and pieces.

1792
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,240
Stop, stop, disconnecting.

1793
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,080
I heard the word November.

1794
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,680
I heard November.

1795
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,640
Yeah, no, not November was being discussed.

1796
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,880
I just, guys, you should listen back to your own shit

1797
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,000
if you listen, because that I just cannot fucking tell.

1798
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,720
Okay, no, no, no, no, listening back,

1799
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,360
no, no, listening back isn't gonna work

1800
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,000
because you know what it's supposed to say,

1801
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,960
so you hear it, ask someone else to listen it for you.

1802
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,080
You know, that's a better suggestion.

1803
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,280
If you're not sure, yeah, get a second opinion.

1804
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,680
Because some people I know,

1805
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,080
they'll like play something on a speaker

1806
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,400
and hold it up to their microphone

1807
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,360
and it gets more distorted or things of this nature.

1808
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,320
I know there are some ways around it

1809
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,000
that some people around here discuss.

1810
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,320
So this is just one of these public service announcements.

1811
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,480
If it's unintelligible, even if it sounds potentially good,

1812
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,920
obviously it's gonna be an issue for playing on the show.

1813
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,680
It's actually bad.

1814
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,440
It's actually not quality.

1815
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,760
Well, I mean, that's it, that's our last voicemail.

1816
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,000
Wait, really?

1817
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,240
Yeah, I mean, there was just a couple today.

1818
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,480
We've only gone, we're only on an hour and 18.

1819
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Uh-oh, stall for time, stall for time.

1820
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,320
Only an hour.

1821
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,480
Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry, I skipped one.

1822
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,440
I did actually skip one, now that I look at it, whoops.

1823
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,760
Oh, it better be a good one.

1824
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,840
It's gonna be a 40 minute voicemail.

1825
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,680
Save us.

1826
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,560
Oh, it's 100% not, it's, no, it's not.

1827
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,200
This is another kind of, okay,

1828
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,240
let me just fucking play it, all right, here you go.

1829
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,720
It's voicemail guide redemption, go.

1830
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,000
What's up, voicemail guide, try to make it quick.

1831
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,960
Okay, look, I don't think it's very fair

1832
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,280
that you're giving other people a chance

1833
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,800
to start arcs and finish their arcs

1834
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,280
when you're not willing to finish mine.

1835
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,440
If I just want some redemption,

1836
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,680
can you please finish my arc?

1837
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,160
Guess who I am, Hippo, Nate, Ben.

1838
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh my God.

1839
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,080
The most you guys could know me.

1840
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,320
Your other hint is Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts, okay?

1841
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,000
It'll all make sense in due time.

1842
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,640
Are you Keyblade Spirit?

1843
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,440
I don't fucking know, that could be you.

1844
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,640
It definitely could be you, but listen to the entitlement.

1845
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,760
Once again, it's not fair you finish other people's arcs.

1846
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,720
Okay, you know what?

1847
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,560
I'll give you that.

1848
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,680
Keyblade Spirit is a good guess,

1849
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,040
like I have no other guess beside that,

1850
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,800
so I'm just gonna go with it.

1851
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,120
Are you Keyblade Spirit?

1852
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,680
There you go, but, I mean,

1853
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,160
you must certainly understand a fair voicemail guide.

1854
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,000
Oh, hey, you know what?

1855
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,840
You know what happened?

1856
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,680
Yeah.

1857
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,480
Something funny happened in, it was during slime fest.

1858
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,520
Oh, wait, you know what, I wanna say something.

1859
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,120
People don't know.

1860
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,960
Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers is on a new channel.

1861
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,800
Oh, that's right, that's right.

1862
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,280
And the newest episode, like the full, like real episode,

1863
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,440
not a Twitch VOD re-uploaded,

1864
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,600
but like an actual, like me and Munchy sit down

1865
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,880
and make like a three hour long actual RFCK episode

1866
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,000
is up and is the most recent video

1867
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,120
on the Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers channel.

1868
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,720
And it's only got like 400 views,

1869
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,920
and I think a lot of people just don't know it's there.

1870
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,760
But it is.

1871
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,600
Yeah, I think you're right.

1872
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,440
We've moved to a new channel,

1873
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,320
link in the description for that.

1874
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,160
Okay, actually.

1875
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,000
Speaking of Munchy, did he ever explain himself to you

1876
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,840
why he called you?

1877
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,680
Oh, yes, he did.

1878
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,120
He said, oops, I didn't mean to call you,

1879
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,680
but I did mean to ask if I got clearance

1880
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,440
to listen to Storm Before the Storm,

1881
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,480
which is a book we were talking about

1882
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,900
that I did listen to on Audible,

1883
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,320
but I was gonna listen to it again,

1884
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,320
but I think he wants to do it.

1885
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,000
And yeah, I'm not re-listening to this.

1886
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,120
So the answer was yes.

1887
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,280
Word.

1888
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,120
Yes, been listening to books.

1889
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,000
So it was streaming.

1890
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,360
We were streaming Slime Fest yesterday.

1891
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,520
And at the end, at the very end of it, spoiler alert,

1892
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,000
I won the moral victory, as always.

1893
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,160
Way to go, which is another way of saying

1894
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,240
of losing the actual competition.

1895
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,080
That's not true.

1896
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,000
That's just not true.

1897
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,840
It's all in how you look at it.

1898
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,680
Okay, understood.

1899
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,440
Victory is a social construct.

1900
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,920
And so at the very end,

1901
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,040
we were talking about what the next contest would be,

1902
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,000
and I said a karaoke contest,

1903
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,360
and I was reminded of the karaoke contest

1904
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,640
between Christine Weston-Chandler and Solid Chris

1905
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,000
and Liquid Chris, when Chris challenged Liquid

1906
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,240
to a Singstar karaoke contest

1907
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,240
to determine who was the real Chris.

1908
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,280
And I said this, and then I went back to record,

1909
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,720
what's the word, to make the VOD,

1910
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,640
to highlight the VOD, so it'd be saved.

1911
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,840
And I see at the very end, after I said that,

1912
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,240
Chris appears in chat to say,

1913
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,280
like, hmm, a karaoke contest is to say,

1914
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,800
who's who, sounds a little too familiar.

1915
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,640
Lol.

1916
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,680
And I was like, lol, she heard me say the whole thing.

1917
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,520
That's hilarious.

1918
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,360
I think that was the only comment she made.

1919
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,800
She just shows up to my streams now.

1920
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,720
It's pretty funny.

1921
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,600
I mean, yeah, clearly invested in the narrative

1922
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,440
to some degree.

1923
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,440
It's pretty funny.

1924
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,160
I've been a little slower

1925
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,860
on the slime and punishment updates lately,

1926
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,960
but I've got a couple in the can ready to go,

1927
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,880
maybe later today or tomorrow.

1928
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,200
Sick, sick.

1929
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,560
I've been checking your feed, looking for him regularly,

1930
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,680
so you've got at least one person.

1931
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,560
You've got at least one person who gives the fuck.

1932
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,120
I'm really looking forward to it.

1933
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,960
I mean, I'm not gonna lie,

1934
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,560
I'm held in out for that keg standard cameo.

1935
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,080
Although I did see him in, what was it,

1936
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,800
Phantom Point was like thinking about something,

1937
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,680
and then he had a little thought bubble of a...

1938
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:35,240
Yeah, he's talking to Dupati and Tupati,

1939
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,560
and he's talking about the importance of,

1940
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,520
today I learned about the importance of loving your brother,

1941
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,880
even when you don't always get a long line crib

1942
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,040
directly from Friendship is Witchcraft.

1943
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:47,880
Oh yeah.

1944
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,880
I think, I guess it won't spoil too much.

1945
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,880
I think there will probably be a keg cameo in the epilogue.

1946
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,440
Sure, seems understandable.

1947
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,920
I think that would be an appropriate time for it.

1948
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,240
Hey, as long as it's appropriate.

1949
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,080
Yeah.

1950
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,400
No interference here with the artistic process.

1951
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,160
Yeah, and I won't say in what context,

1952
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,120
but that's a tentative plan.

1953
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,360
So guys, you can all put down your pitchforks,

1954
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,080
your favorite character, just give it a little time.

1955
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,200
All these bullshit meme side characters,

1956
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,280
they'll get out of the way soon.

1957
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,080
I'm really looking forward to having it done,

1958
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,960
because I feel like when I say, guys, it's done, it's finished.

1959
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,440
I feel like that's the point when a lot of people will be like,

1960
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,320
oh, okay, if it's actually done,

1961
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,840
then maybe I'll go back and read it.

1962
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,320
Because that's what I did with Balejap.

1963
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,960
Like when Hippo said, like, oh yeah,

1964
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,720
I just released the finale, it's over.

1965
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,360
I was like, oh shit, I guess I gotta read it now.

1966
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,680
And I did.

1967
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,080
People love a finished product.

1968
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,920
Yeah.

1969
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,760
Yeah.

1970
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,640
Speaking of finished products,

1971
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,560
we should show them the new bonus episode,

1972
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,400
because it's good or so.

1973
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,720
Oh, you know, I'm so glad you mentioned that.

1974
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah, maybe I would remember it at the end.

1975
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,240
But yeah, the new bonus episode is,

1976
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,280
the day of recording, I'll be releasing it after we're done.

1977
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,840
And it's game development,

1978
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,400
and there's a whole bunch of links to games we've made,

1979
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,240
including the ones we mentioned before.

1980
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,080
There's my little demo, I made it with my buddy John.

1981
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:13,280
I've untitled Music Jumper, featuring QT Bass Drop.

1982
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,800
There's the, of course, the Izumi game stuff

1983
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,280
is linked in there.

1984
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,600
Mage has some works,

1985
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,440
some artwork from various projects.

1986
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,280
Other things too.

1987
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,800
The Saint Comics, the champion game,

1988
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,680
which has just been up on SaintComics.com the whole time.

1989
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,400
But I linked that too, I guess.

1990
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,240
Indeed, indeed.

1991
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,080
Also a game.

1992
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,880
A world game bell I made with my buddy Rich back in the day

1993
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,800
in college, that was a good time too.

1994
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,240
An endless war.

1995
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,520
Slime game.

1996
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,520
If you could call it a game.

1997
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,840
Slime game, not a lifestyle.

1998
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,160
It's more of a lifestyle choice, yeah.

1999
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,880
All right, we've delayed long enough.

2000
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,360
We can wrap it up here, I think, boys and girls.

2001
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,480
That's, we've done our due diligence.

2002
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,440
We won't torment you any longer.

2003
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,920
So let's see what's going on.

2004
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,880
Of course, patreon.com slash the procrastinators

2005
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,080
is always going on.

2006
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,280
It's the hip-hoppin' in place

2007
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,000
for all your social media updates

2008
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,480
and currency draining exchanges.

2009
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,080
If you're on the Discord server,

2010
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,560
you don't even need Twitter anymore.

2011
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,880
It's just outdated that.

2012
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,840
Yeah, get off Twitter and get in the PCP Discord.

2013
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,680
That's it.

2014
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,520
Very true.

2015
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,840
That's what it's about.

2016
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,240
It's better, anyway.

2017
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,960
Oh, you know, the other day, someone in your Discord bed,

2018
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,500
first of all, they added me.

2019
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,400
They added me specifically.

2020
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,040
I just said like some, I mean, in my opinion,

2021
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,560
it was horrific bullshit, but I mean,

2022
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,640
the way that I read it, I won't say their name

2023
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,880
because we made peace.

2024
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,440
But it sounded like what this person's point was,

2025
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,840
like, hey, Nate, just so you know,

2026
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,120
like everything you've ever done

2027
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,440
is like a pale shadow of Digi and you're pathetic

2028
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,480
and I don't respect you.

2029
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,320
Oh, wow.

2030
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,640
I mean, okay.

2031
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,760
I'm exaggerating for comedic effect right now,

2032
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,840
but that was kind of the gist of what I read into it.

2033
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,080
What actually, as we, so I got very angry,

2034
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,280
but as we teased it out, their point seemed more to be,

2035
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,640
hey, Nate, I don't actually think content

2036
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,600
is the best use of your time

2037
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,320
and would prefer you to do like your big videos.

2038
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,240
And well, okay, just say that then.

2039
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah, that's a very different statement, right?

2040
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,120
But if they just said that,

2041
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,320
they wouldn't make you mad and get a response out of you.

2042
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,280
Oh my God, you've cracked the code.

2043
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,320
That's very true.

2044
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,680
That's, you know, that's true.

2045
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,520
Well, it's all right.

2046
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,360
It's all right.

2047
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,680
Interpreted better and all is well.

2048
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,520
What were we talking about?

2049
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,040
Oh yes, of course, money, patreon.com

2050
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,160
slash the procrastinators, $5 bonus episodes,

2051
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,880
game dev one, actually a good bonus episode, guys.

2052
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,720
Actually a good one.

2053
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,560
What do you mean?

2054
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,400
They're all gems.

2055
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

2056
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,400
They're all gems, but some sparkle more than others.

2057
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,160
Well, most of them are gems in the rough,

2058
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,640
so just lumps of coal,

2059
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,800
but this one is actually a semi-formed one.

2060
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,640
This one's particularly good.

2061
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,600
So we all have experience projects to share.

2062
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,360
Indeed, indeed.

2063
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,320
And go listen to that.

2064
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,920
End of the 31 other episodes,

2065
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,760
32 total of the bonus episodes

2066
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,320
for the low, low fee of $5 on the Patreon.

2067
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,320
$1, you're in the bonus, not the bonus,

2068
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,720
the PCB discord, the patron discord.

2069
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,080
Good times, be there, obviously, as you said before.

2070
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,000
And more, hey, as much as you want.

2071
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,800
You could also go give $5 a month

2072
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,440
to the PCP Minecraft server if you want as well.

2073
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,640
Play Minecraft with us.

2074
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,280
We got a stream coming up.

2075
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,640
I think right now we have it scheduled

2076
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,240
for Friday, December the 13th.

2077
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,520
So keep an eye out for that if you wanna play,

2078
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,880
so we will be there around then sometime in December.

2079
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,840
And what else is going on?

2080
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,560
At TPCrasnators on Twitter,

2081
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,840
updates and whatnot, retweets, et cetera, et cetera.

2082
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,160
And, of course, Speakpipe, leave more voicemails

2083
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,000
so that we can respond to them here on the show.

2084
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,040
Thanks, everybody for doing that.

2085
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,960
Voicemail God, I forgive you.

2086
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,280
All right, we'll see you next week, everybody.

2087
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,520
And there it is, character art concluded.

2088
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,600
Forgiveness, redemption.

2089
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,560
All right, see you next week, everybody.

2090
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,400
Bye.

2091
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,760
Bye, thank you.
