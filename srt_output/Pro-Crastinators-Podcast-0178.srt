00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,260
the best guy ever. Today we've got Tom Oliver.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,000
The time has come and so have I. I need to change my pants now.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Gibbontake is here.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Goodbye.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's Ben Saint.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Woo, slime, slime.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And Mage, lethal of Aurora version.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Take a sip of tea and chillax.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, yes.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That sounds excellent. Hello everyone. How has your week been going so far? Have you voted in the Minecraft poll from last week?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If not, do so. Tell us what you think about these potential server ideas. We would love to know.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I hope your current message is not going to be outdated by the time the episode comes out.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Current message? Will we have made up a different plan?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe we'll decide in the week and then this episode comes out.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They can vote. It's not going to hurt anything to keep voting even after we've decided, but maybe we'll have a plan in place by the time that's done.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your vote may be in vain.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The people, the peasants have a vote, but this is still a dictatorship at the end of the day.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We have a vote. We just don't do anything about it.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just like real life.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, yeah. Electoral college and whatnot.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What do they call them? Those special voters? The super delegates? That's the one that killed my boy Bernie last time.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We gotta end them.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's going on in your life, Gib? How's things?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, there's a few things I've been doing. I've been watching MLP Season 8 trying to catch up to the end of the show.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So far, the verdict on Season 8 is that I don't care about anything that happens with the characters I know and love.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I only care about the new characters that I know and love.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the opposite of what I was expecting you to say.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, it's just so boring. They're oxa-over and every time they have a friendship problem, this doesn't make any sense based on the years of you learning this over and over again.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's stupid.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, it's okay. Fluttershy is about baby steps. It's okay. She can learn the same lesson over and over.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm having more flashbacks. Don't go there.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not just Fluttershy. It's everyone. It's like, Applejack, why are you fucking stupid? Oh, it's just because of convenience for the episode. Whatever. Fine. It's a shit show.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The real moral of My Little Pony is that you're destiny set in stone and no matter how much personal improvement you make, you cannot change your decision to ever be taught in your own problems.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The thing that happens in the beginning of Season 8 is that Twilight decides to open a school of friendship and invites this after the movie, Season 8.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So like the Hippogriffs, the Griffins, the Yaks, the Dragons, they're all allied kingdoms now and the changelings and all that.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And the students from all those respective kingdoms are cool. They have it a lot of episodes together.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And the Crystal Map sends them to far-flung places like Saddle Arabia.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's like, yeah, all the new stuff, all the Starlight Glimmer is now my favorite pony of the main seven.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What? She's the only irrational one happening.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She's literally the only rational one, the one who will say, that's a fucking stupid idea, everyone.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, that's good.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This spicy take is making me want to watch the show right now.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If somebody, maybe I could go through and cross off all the ones that are bad, because it's mostly filler.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If only someone could review these episodes and let me know.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If only someone did that.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What a shame. What a shame that fandom's dead.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, well, I'm glad.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If only my boy drowning in horseshoes was still around to give me some guidance.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, he let us know.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Rest in peace.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But yeah, season eight, I'm finished at, yeah, I'm near the end.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's fine. It's bad and it's good and it's, I like Starlight Glimmer and Trixie episodes.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right, Trixie is a main character now.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, she's Starlight Glimmer's best friend. The two of them together are very good.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Discord loves Dungeons and Dragons and he's best friends and he has guys nights out with Spike and Big Mac.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh my God.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Dude, you're hard selling me right now. You're hard selling me right now.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's lots of little things that are new and interesting, but anything that is like well-trodden ground, I'm like, shut up.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shut up.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, it makes sense.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You said season eight, there's nine seasons, right?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, yes, I was getting through season eight and nine, I haven't seen.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Big Mac gets a girlfriend, I'm not sure if it's in season eight.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh yeah, Big Mac got a girlfriend, I think in season six.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What about Cherily, God damn it?

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She's cucked for life.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I haven't seen Cherily in two or three seasons. Where is she?

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She doesn't exist anymore because in season eight, the school, the main six run is the most important one.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And even the CMC are like, fuck, I hate Cherily's lessons, it's so fucking boring.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm gonna go into this new school and they have a whole episode about that.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, this is Cherily erasure.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They put her out of business.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What is a teacher gonna do when her competition is like the princess friendship?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Big magic coming in and crushing the Mod Pod institutions of education.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, no kidding.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, also.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The people need to rise up against these fucking monarchs.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Spike had a teenager episode and grew wings and now he has wings.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, I remember that. Shocking, but also good.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, it was pretty good.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A lot of things that I had seen hearsay of, like the grotesque image of the ponies, the fake main six melting in their faces,

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
like dropping, like falling to pieces and like, fuck you, chrysalis or whatever they said.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Directly out.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Like those things were in context.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They're like, oh, that's not as ridiculous or stupid as I thought.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Like Spike getting wings, I thought that's gonna be fucking stupid, but it was alright.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, alright.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I always was sad that he didn't have wings.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I thought, wow, what a sad, retarded little dragon who'll never be one of the cool guys.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But I guess you just need to grow up.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Jonah the yak is my favorite of the creatures.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, they say every creature now.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That was the thing.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They can't say every pony.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They have to say every creature in front of the creatures.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's fucking weird.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, it makes sense, but it is silly.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know what the worst part is, is that all these other people come in and they finally change their language,

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but our boy Spike had to endure it for six goddamn years of being a race.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's so true.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Spike sort of thought of himself as a pony to be quite...

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, because he's been brainwashed by the suppressed culture.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is fucking like cultural pony hegemony.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is fucking like all dragons are assumed to be ponies until proven otherwise.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everyone's assumed default.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No minorities, please.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's okay, Spike, you're one of the good ones.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Spike definitely has dragon guilt.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He does.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is fucked up.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't like it.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He must have said every pony referring to everyone including himself many times.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He definitely did.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He definitely did.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's straight up.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It just makes you wonder, so up till recently, look, the other kingdoms were nearby.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They weren't unknown.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Was a pony land or whatever so close, Equestria so closed off from these other countries?

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Basically, yes.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think whenever the map was introduced, they went to all these different kingdoms.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Up until that point, everyone was closed off from one another.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Equestria was the pony place, the yaks, the dragons.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why did it open up?

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because of various friendship envoys to make friends with everyone.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Was it the magic table that sent the main six to go around the world and solve everyone's friendship problems?

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is that what opened up the borders?

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you for making friends with the yaks.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I remember that one.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I remember the yak kingdom and the griffin kingdom and I assume there were probably others.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why hadn't Celestia opened up these trade routes?

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because she's a fucking stupid character and every time she's on screen, I'm like, you ruined everything.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, she was busy managing the sun and the moon.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It tastes like a minute in the morning.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you think that Celestia demands that the other kingdoms pay tribute for having soul power and control over the sun and moon?

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, that would be the wise thing to do.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You gotta bring in those six dollars somehow.

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Exactly.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, I don't think you can...

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You don't even have to charge them for it.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can just hold the hostage over their heads.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, no, I'll do this.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If you don't do what I want, I won't do it anymore and I'll plunge you into eternal life.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Is Pony world or whatever? Do we know that that's a globe world or could it be some sort of flat earth?

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where just like in the flat earth, the orbs just sort of move around in like concentric circles or whatever and then they...

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm pretty sure we don't know that it's an orb world.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It could definitely be a flat land.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You guys had your chance. You were in the same area with Lauren Faust and you didn't ask the important questions.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That would have been agreed.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, no, 100%. I wonder if maybe someone has asked the question and there is an answer and we just don't know it.

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's probably, I bet it somewhere.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
For the future, if anyone ever gets somewhere near Lauren Faust, the first question you ask is the Pony world around or flat?

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, that'd be helpful.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We need to know.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I do. I really do.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Where are the ice walls and where are they in Equestria? I need to go there.

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The world is very much unexplored, I guess, in other directions.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Was there any reverence of Pony?

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh wait, they came from Ponyland originally, right?

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's the lore in Heart Swarming Eve and then they came to Equestria.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They came from someplace that it was too cold.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Or do we assume it's Ponyland?

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Did it even have a name?

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't think a name was said. I think we assumed and we don't actually know.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The ancient Pony places where the kings and everyone's...

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then they went and they left and they went to form Equestria or whatever.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Twilight and Celestia and Luna did.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Shit.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well, there you go.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We've learned a lot, I guess.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We've learned a valuable lesson about friendship today.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Dear Twilight Sparkle, I learned...

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Nothing.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaking of learning a valuable lesson about friendship.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I learned I was racist against my dragon friend for six years.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's pernicious, not overt anti-dragon racism.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just subtle anti-dragon erasure.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That reminds me of this one episode that made me so sad for a spike.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So Twilight and...

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What's her brother's name?

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Shining Armor.

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Shining Armor.

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They used to apparently have this brother-sister competition sort of thing.

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Shining Armor I think used to win, but Twilight would really try.

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And like Spike, poor baby Spike, he was a baby dragon.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He really wanted to participate, but no one acknowledged him as part of the family even.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, he was a baby, I guess.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So we see the flashbacks, like they got stars or something, I think, for completing a task.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And Spike, he tried, he wanted a star too, but no one cared.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Spike is gonna grow up, become a full-size dragon and fucking murder these people.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's gonna be completely justified.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In the episode they do acknowledge that he's like,

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think the competition was like he had the best sibling or something.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Best sibling?

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So in the episode, they finally, after like six years or however long they lived for,

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
they finally gave him his star or something.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't remember.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, finally acknowledged him as a sibling.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, okay, but speaking of learning a valuable lesson about friendship,

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
are you guys following the Adventures of Phantom Horn in New Los Angeles City,

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
aka Neil Milwaukee?

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I love it.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This has been a fantastic journey, because I have to know,

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and I have to, I'm gonna give you the credit,

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm gonna give you the benefit that I doubt,

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and saying that this was the plan all along.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This was a slow burn fucking way of indoctrinating an entirely new group of people into your project

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
via Chris Chan.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's exactly right.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Exactly right.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The scheme slowly started to reveal itself,

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and I was like, this is fucking devious as shit,

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and I'm all about it.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, I mean I got the links in there.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's all good.

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No, this was the plan ever since Phantom and Keg recorded that very first podcast

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
with the still images.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was all leading to this.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay, okay, well like, fuck.

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like, fucking, I just, there's the part,

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
in Sonichu episode 12-9, nobody knows why it's numbered that way,

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but in Sonichu episode 12-9, you meet Nightstar, Chris's pony Sona,

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and she says, because Chris has heterochromia, or thinks she does,

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
you know, the green eye and the blue eye.

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Does Chris not actually have that?

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like so subtle that it's not, it's kind of bullshit,

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but it's part of her self-image,

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and Nightstar also has it,

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
but she explains that during a science experiment,

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
she got some slime in her eye, and it turned one of her eyes green.

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's absolutely canon, right?

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's 100% canon.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's in the comic, she says it.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The exact word slime is used.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, she got slime in her eye during a science experiment.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So I drew her getting slime in her eye, you know, ha ha,

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it turns her eye green, and then she sees New Los Angeles City,

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and then I drew a couple more stuff that was drew her sending

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
phantom and strawberry milk to New Los Angeles City,

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and then Chris at some point later acknowledged it,

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
you know, like retweeted it, like she said she wanted to use

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the pictures of Nightstar as,

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Chris is using those pictures of Nightstar going,

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
hmm, I get it, you're lying.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She's using those as reaction images on Twitter at people.

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh wow.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, she's doing it.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Like when she says someone says something she doesn't agree with.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I'm like, well, I gotta continue the story now.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I've drawn like 70 or 80 panels of it now.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, I just checked out the thread yesterday fully.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So not only did when Chris like retweeted,

261
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
it said like, not only is this canon,

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it's actually canon to real life because of the dimensional merge.

263
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This has been decreed as I understand it.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, I mean, it's, yes, but with the caveat that like

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
literally everything is canon to real life,

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
because Chris believes that basically all fiction occurs

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in this other dimension called C197,

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but it occurs all in one dimension,

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
not even in different dimensions.

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, there might be, there are other dimensions,

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but like the world where like cartoons live is C197.

272
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And it is, our dimension is dimension 1218

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that is merging with C197.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So this is why all cartoons are going to become real.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Does anime live in the same world as cartoons,

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
or does it have a separate anime dimension?

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I would assume, yeah, I think it all happens in C197.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, you have a direct line to Chris now.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can just ask these questions and get to you.

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah, like she followed me and she's,

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
okay, yeah, she's retweeting, okay.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
She was retweeting the bits and pieces of the comic

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and she was making comments about it.

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She made a fucking huge 40 tweet long essay

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
about the comic, talking about why Nightstar did all that.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I talked to her a little bit and we discussed

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
why did Nightstar send the New Los Angeles City

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and I said, oh, well, it's so they could learn

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
a valuable lesson about it.

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
She contacts me and she's like, this is the story.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to tell this in the show.

292
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
She contacts me and she's like, okay.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So fan, love the comic.

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Love the comic, Ben.

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Big fan of your work.

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Definitely going to tell everyone to patron you

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
at patreon.com slash ben saint.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Nice.

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But, Nightstar would never be so cruel

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
as to banish them to New Los Angeles.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She would never throw them through the portal,

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
but it's okay.

303
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh boy, here comes the editorial comments

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
from the peanut gallery.

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But it's okay.

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We can explain it as a nightmare that they had.

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I'm like, all right, Chris, that's fine.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But consider this, she actually did them a favor

309
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
because she sent them through the portal

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to learn a valuable lesson about friendship.

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And she's like, oh my God, you're absolutely right.

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yep, no, you're right.

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're right.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That is what literally happened in real life.

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
She said, listen, this is true.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is true.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm going to scroll back.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to quote her directly.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
All right.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She says, oh, well, she was thrilled to meet

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the creator of Phantom Horn.

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Did she know Phantom Horn specifically?

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, she did.

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think she knows Phantom Horn and give and take

325
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
from TF2 analysis anarchy.

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh my God.

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Here we go.

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Here we go.

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Quote.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Quote.

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And keep in your mind, heart.

336
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wait, what?

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Wait, hold on.

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Keep your mind, heart, and mind's eye open.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You will personally meet Phantom Horn

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and everyone else very soon in good tidings

341
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and combined working efforts against our foes.

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I sense the magic in you.

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You shall do well for yourself, Ben.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that a private message?

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is a private message, she said to me.

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So Christian can sense the magic in me.

347
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Damn.

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You have possibly like the first extreme,

349
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
like first party direct line of contact with Chris

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
for your part two of the Christian lecture.

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know.

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Nothing has to be left of the speculation anymore.

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can get around the phone like during the lecture.

354
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

355
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know, I've been wondering,

356
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you're a Christian guru.

357
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
A Christian historian, yeah.

358
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How much like saying like,

359
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
oh, the dimensional merge is real life and stuff,

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but then also coming to you,

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the artist of a comic and explaining

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
like how what you wrote is like not true,

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but then when you have told her

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
how it could be true, she has made it real,

365
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but like here's how much of it is actually like,

366
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
like she's just being like a performer,

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
sort of like creating this fake,

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
you know, this idea of the dimensional mode,

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
like how much of it is actually real?

370
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Here's what I think.

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think that to Chris,

372
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
an artist, someone who's creating a story

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
is basically like a prophet

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and that they are basically receiving visions

375
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
from another world.

376
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They have their glimpsing into another world

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and seeing what is transpiring there.

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So like...

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Quick question on that front.

380
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I mean, you can debate the legitimacy of prophecy, right?

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So it's not that like everything that everyone writes

382
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
is necessarily true, they can be wrong

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and Chris can debate and say,

384
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
oh no, that can't be what actually happened, right?

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If I were to come up with an OC right now on the spot

386
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that did not exist before,

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
does that make that creation real by doing such?

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Or was it already real?

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm merely tapping into this.

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It was already real.

392
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're just like realizing them.

393
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're communing with things beyond us.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, it's not even like this is a stupid idea.

395
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Like I've had...

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I mean, not that it's literally real,

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but the idea that like everything fictional exists,

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it's just like you have to tap into,

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
like when you have a great idea,

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
you know, your brain is like linked to this real character.

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean, this isn't like a far out concept.

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, it's like a cool, like a world connecting thing.

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I know people who function with this mentality,

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
not like taking it seriously, but just for the sake of...

405
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, what I'm curious about is how much of it is taken seriously.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I guess you could never know, truly.

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's a good question.

408
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay, what was the name for that?

409
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Like there was the other kin,

410
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and then there was like a faction of other kin

411
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that believed that they were fictional characters.

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the idea was that...

413
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Fiction kin?

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Fiction kin, I think.

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is that right?

416
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay, well, yeah, and the idea there was the same.

417
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's that like, you know, in an infinite multiverse,

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
all possibilities are true.

419
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Therefore, every fictional idea you could possibly have

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
must have occurred in some alternate reality,

421
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
just by like matter of probability.

422
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Therefore, every fictional character you know

423
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
does exist in some other timeline.

424
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And therefore, it is possible for me

425
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
to be the reincarnation of Ty from Digimon.

426
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Right, even granting all that is true.

427
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
To then go on and say, the dimensional merge is happening

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
with the cartoon world, and we will soon meet Sonichu and Mario,

429
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and we will be best friends.

430
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's another step forward in the calculus.

431
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That is a...that's kind of a new...

432
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's a relatively new development.

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a bold new idea, yeah.

434
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Some guys called the idea guys, I think,

435
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
put that idea into her head.

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean, I think she probably wanted to...

437
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The idea guys are a big thing.

438
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is something I need to research more,

439
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
because understanding modern Chris,

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
you cannot understand it without the idea...

441
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And the idea guys are shrouded in mystery

442
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
because they are literally criminals

443
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
who fucking like embezzled and stole money from her.

444
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They're not cool at all.

445
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's some of the stuff that they made her think is funny,

446
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and they are bad guys who I hate.

447
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You know, Ben, you've long claimed to be an idea guy yourself,

448
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
as I recall.

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm an ideas man, not the idea guy,

450
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
not even the same.

451
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I understand.

452
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm going to feed this file, not a profile.

453
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I think we're ignoring, though, a very important question.

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think we're wearing a very important question.

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Nate, I recall a few scant years ago,

456
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you sat in the very seat I'm sitting right now,

457
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and turned down the opportunity to be in TF2 Analysis Anarchy.

458
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
How does it feel to know that that decision

459
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
closed the door on Chris Chan, recognizing you...

460
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Chris will never know keg standard.

461
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, we'll tell him how upset can I be,

462
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
being that I am merely a vessel through which we perceive

463
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the events of the fictional universe that would happen

464
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
regardless of our interference.

465
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because we're just low immortals at the end of the day.

466
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was only the illusion of choice, Tom.

467
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It was only the illusion of choice.

468
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You have to tell yourself to let you sleep at night, Nate.

469
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's fine.

470
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, y'all know.

471
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's exactly what I will hear tonight.

472
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
No.

473
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay.

474
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In like Chris's first DMs, she says like,

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
you know, she says like,

476
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
oh, it's great to meet the creator of Phantom Horn.

477
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I love Phantom Horn.

478
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He's a pretty unicorn.

479
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He's a great unicorn.

480
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He's an inspiration.

481
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think the implication is that he's like a trans inspiration.

482
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Although I didn't...

483
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I wish I'd asked more about that,

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
but I didn't press her on it, but it doesn't matter.

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But she says like...

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
She's like, you know,

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I loved you in...

489
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You know what?

490
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll just...

491
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll just fucking find it.

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
She said something about like the lore.

493
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
There's like lore about Phantom Horn in an Alice's Anarchy.

494
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't even know.

495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Really?

496
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Something shenanigans.

497
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
She says memes can be funny with a laughing emoji.

498
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So that's great.

499
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Agreed.

500
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Hard agree.

501
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Y'all have some common ground there.

502
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That's great.

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, here we go.

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Here we go.

505
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I am a fan of blah, blah, blah, blah.

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Dr. Wolfe does awesome work.

507
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And getting into Anarchy during BronyCon in 18 and after,

508
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I got to show and got to know and appreciate everyone else in that group as well.

509
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Shame Phantom Horn was outside of the Respawn Generator range.

510
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, no.

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Just working his oats and asserting his magical identity.

512
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And I looked on everyone else's channels.

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So I guess the idea is that Phantom was killed in Team Fortress 2

514
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and Alice's Anarchy because he died,

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
but he was outside the range of the Respawn Generator or something.

516
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Who came up with that?

517
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Did it come up with that?

518
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't know.

519
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That was not addressed in the official videos.

520
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Unless they mentioned it later.

521
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Somebody needs to get in contact with Dr. Wolfe.

522
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We got to nail down the details.

523
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I wonder if people asked them like,

524
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
hey, what happened to that guy who was in the first episode and never came back

525
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and someone had to be like,

526
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
oh, when he died, he was outside the Respawn Generator.

527
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I know for a fact that they have done that with my character when I was replaced.

528
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Really?

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That same sort of thing.

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They explained what happened to me.

531
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Was it the same explanation?

532
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What happened again?

533
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No, no.

534
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The thing with mine was like, when I left, I said,

535
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
tell them I left to become a pirate because I was doing the Pony Coast.

536
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, that's right.

537
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So I was trying to make it all canon, all slot together neatly.

538
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So I think they just reiterated that.

539
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That I became a pirate.

540
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

541
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's what I know.

542
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, Phantom Horn is canonically dead.

543
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He'll be like, everyone else died.

544
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
He's the...

545
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
No, literally, they fucking Zuckerberged him.

546
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He got fucking Zuckerberged.

547
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Do you guys know this terminology?

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No.

549
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't.

550
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In Slime City, you can perm a kill somebody by Zuckerberging them

551
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and you just have to make really sure that their body and slime don't get into the sewers

552
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and they don't come back.

553
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Okay, so you bury them in filthy dirt.

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's what Slime Corp did to Mark Zuckerberg

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
when they legally acquired Facebook and all social media.

556
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know, I criticized them, but it was probably the right move.

557
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, I think so.

558
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The amounts of capital generated really justify any eggs that needed to be broken.

559
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They speak for themselves.

560
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So yeah, I've been fucking drawing this Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk

561
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
in New Los Angeles City Comic.

562
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's fucking great.

563
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm cranking it out.

564
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm very, very excited.

565
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I've been very prolific.

566
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Check it out on Twitter.

567
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm cataloging it all in a big Imgir thread.

568
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's pretty cool.

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
My concern over the manipulation of Chris is at a low to medium, so that's not a big deal.

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Low to medium?

571
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, what am I doing?

572
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh, come on.

573
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know.

574
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Telling it funny.

575
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm having a goof.

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm writing a comic.

577
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm telling a story.

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, literally the only thing that could be conceived of as bad is that you're shilling

579
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and that's not even that bad because endless war is not like a paid thing.

580
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You just jump in a discord.

581
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

582
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I just want to fucking get the word out there and also it would be really cool if Chris

583
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
were to draw Phantom Horn or even better New Los Angeles City in the comic, which I

584
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
don't think is outside the realm of possibility because, oh, oh, sure.

585
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay.

586
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So Chris, okay, this is my final note on the subject if you want to move on, but Chris

587
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
was a little, okay, Chris did not disavow.

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
She didn't be like, okay, this is a troll.

589
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's never mind, right?

590
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It wasn't like that.

591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
She was still defending it even after the 9-11, right?

592
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
9-11, but she was clearly a little uncomfortable with the 9-11 thing, but she didn't say like,

593
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
this is not, she literally said in her responses, like, this is what Ben said.

594
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
She added me on Twitter.

595
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
She's like, this is what Ben saw happening in the timeline.

596
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,400
This is what he saw in C1 to 9-7, like this is canon, you know, and remember, this isn't

597
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
New York.

598
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
This isn't a real 9-11.

599
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
This is fake 9-11.

600
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,120
This isn't, this isn't the buildings.

601
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
It's all fine.

602
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
It's fine, guys.

603
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
It's fine.

604
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,600
Like, she went out of her way to establish that it's fine because no one was in the buildings,

606
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,720
but this event did happen and fucking Paradox Crocs and Sweet Mouse did these incredible

607
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,800
spiral pirouettes off the, oh my, you know, I got a huge laugh out of that moment.

608
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,480
I did not know where that was going when I saw that they performed yet.

609
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
This might be the best 9-11 yet.

610
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
That was tremendous.

611
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
A record-breaking 9-11.

612
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
That was a tremendous laugh.

613
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Are you going to explain how the reviving system works so that minds can be said at

614
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
ease?

615
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Ooh, no, I'm not going to spoil it.

616
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Not going to spoil anything.

617
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Ooh.

618
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Not going to spoil anything.

619
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Okay, okay.

620
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,400
But what I wanted to say about that was, um, fuck.

621
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh, no.

622
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Where was it going with that?

623
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Oh, no, no.

624
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Dude, just describing the comic, you were talking about how Chris was talking about the 9-11

625
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
and saying that that was Canon still.

626
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,400
It was Canon, but she was a little uncomfortable with it.

627
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Can't imagine why.

628
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,500
But, um, oh, no.

629
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,400
She said it was Canon anyway.

630
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Yeah, but I was going somewhere.

631
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay, you know what?

632
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
If you want to move on.

633
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, you take a minute.

634
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
I have a question or two about this.

635
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Yeah, sure.

636
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,400
Because one of the things that I had, me and Michelle were looking at the comic.

637
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,800
Here, think about it while I ask, yeah, we'll have a minute.

638
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I was curious because it seems like the friendly folks over at Kiwi Farms seems to have taken

639
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,500
an interest in the comic and the Chris involvement here.

640
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm just wondering, is that, what's going on with that?

641
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Anything of note happening there?

642
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Oh, wait, I remember.

643
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,300
Wait, I remember what I was going to say.

644
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,800
And that is that Chris said in one of her tweets that, don't worry guys, Phantom and

645
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Strawberry are protected by fate because they still have big things ahead of them in, like,

646
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,300
back in their home, which makes me think that she might incorporate them.

647
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,800
And I don't know this for sure, but I want to believe that they might make a canonical

648
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
appearance.

649
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
And this is the most exciting thing.

650
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Well, I mean, I mean, and when I say canonical, technically this is already canon because

651
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Chris has canonized it.

652
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
But I mean, like, Chris might.

653
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,800
If Chris could actually draw them or draw, like, that would be so fucking happy.

654
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Okay.

655
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Phantom and Keg, I know, live in Ponyville.

656
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Yes.

657
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Maybe Strawberry Milk does as well.

658
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Yeah, yeah, Strawberry Milk.

659
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Does Chris's ponies live in Ponyville as well?

660
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Who?

661
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Are they there?

662
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Who?

663
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
You know, Nightstar and whoever else?

664
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Yeah, Nightstar lives in Ponyville, I think.

665
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Okay, so they're from the same town.

666
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Okay.

667
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Okay, cool.

668
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Yeah, they must be.

669
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I'm almost positive that Nightstar.

670
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I mean, Nightstar is kind of a dimension-hopping jet-setter fucking Rick type.

671
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
She's a Rick type.

672
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
She just goes all over the fucking place.

673
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
But I'm pretty sure she lives in Ponyville.

674
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Yes.

675
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Okay, so my question was, I noticed...

676
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Oh, yeah, go on.

677
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Yeah, that's all I was saying.

678
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah, Kiwi Farms.

679
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Kiwi Farms is just noticing some of it because, like, because Chris was retweeting it, which

680
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
is pretty...

681
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
It's kind of funny.

682
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I gotta say, I mean, I like...

683
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
I don't...

684
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
They did some fine work over at Kiwi Farms.

685
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Okay.

686
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
They kind of do...

687
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Like, I kind of appreciate that, like, you know, they document all of it.

688
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
And, you know, I can appreciate having a healthy interest in all that.

689
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,800
But I gotta say, the caliber of discussion on Kiwi Farms is poor.

690
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
They are...

691
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Okay.

692
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
The guys on there are, like...

693
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,800
They're making literally decade-old observations and, like, acting like it's still funny, guys.

694
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Like, they are behind the fucking curve on this Chris subject.

695
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
They really are...

696
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Well, not everybody's an expert like you, Ben.

697
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Maybe they're just getting up to speed.

698
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Maybe.

699
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
It's kind of funny sometimes.

700
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Largely, I'm not impressed with what they're doing over there.

701
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I mean, whatever.

702
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Keep on keeping on, guys.

703
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
But try to do better.

704
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I don't know.

705
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
They're like...

706
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Remember that time with...

707
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Remember that time Chris hit that guy with her car?

708
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Well, they all stalwartly stick to using he-him, which really annoys me, but whatever.

709
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm sure I'm not gonna convince anyone over there to do anything about that, so...

710
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Unlikely.

711
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Unlikely.

712
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't know.

713
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Do better, guys.

714
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Do better Kiwi Farms.

715
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I believe in you.

716
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Okay.

717
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
That's interesting.

718
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Anyway, that's what I have to say about that.

719
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I was wondering if they were causing some any issues or...

720
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
They were talking a bit...

721
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
No, no, it's fine.

722
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
We're talking a little...

723
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I checked the Chris thread in there.

724
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
We're talking a little bit about...

725
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Okay, Chris keeps misnaming it New Milwaukee.

726
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah, I saw that.

727
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Even over and over again, I say Neo Milwaukee.

728
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I saw other people being like,

729
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I don't know what the fuck this New Milwaukee is.

730
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
I was like,

731
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
No, you have to say the full name.

732
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Neo Milwaukee, A-K-A.

733
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Yes, I know, but that's not what it's called.

734
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
That's not what it's called.

735
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
It's unacceptable.

736
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
It's unacceptable.

737
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
New York.

738
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
That's how we should...

739
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
The Los Angeles City, A-K-A, Neo Milwaukee.

740
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
God damn it.

741
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Get it right.

742
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Put some respect on the name.

743
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Chris, come on.

744
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm a little concerned...

745
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I mean, it's too early to...

746
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I'm a little concerned that maybe Chris might have been put off by the 9-11 thing,

747
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
because it's been like a whole day,

748
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
and she hasn't liked any of my tweets or retweeted anything I said.

749
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
And I'm freaking out over here, guys.

750
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
It's been like a solid 24 hours.

751
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
That's what happens when you fly too close to the sun.

752
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
You're nervous at all times about that melting wax.

753
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Yeah, you gotta put some more content out.

754
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,800
I guess I gotta put some more content out, and I will.

755
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I've told a couple of people I have the entire arc of...

756
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Basically, this is like chapter one.

757
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I have basically the entire rest of the chapter plotted out.

758
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

759
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,800
It might even be done by the time this episode comes out,

760
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
but not necessarily,

761
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
because we're probably more than halfway through it,

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
or close to it anyway.

763
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,800
But I'm really fucking on this hype train.

764
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
It's very exciting to me.

765
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
It is very interesting.

766
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm having a lot of fun with it.

767
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I don't mean to say this in a critical way,

768
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
but it strikes me that I think you'll have very little problem

769
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
continuing to have Chris's attention,

770
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
because it really does strike me that anybody who made...

771
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Obviously, I like your art a lot,

772
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,800
but anybody who made favorable artwork of Chris's OCs,

773
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
he's going to love it.

774
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
I love it when people make art centered around the things I do.

775
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Yeah, you're right.

776
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
That's a positive prospect.

777
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
You know what I think it might be?

778
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,800
It's not that she was upset about the 9-11 thing.

779
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Maybe it's just that Nightstar herself

780
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
has not been in any panels in a while.

781
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
That is definitely going to be an issue.

782
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Nightstar is more of a background presence right now.

783
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
At the very end, we'll see Nightstar again.

784
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Because for anyone that's not aware,

785
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
the framing that I have set up for this

786
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
is that this is basically...

787
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Phantom Horn is the Twilight Sparkle to Nightstar's Celestia,

788
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
and that Nightstar has tasked him with writing her letters,

789
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
telling him about the friendship lessons

790
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
that he learns along the way.

791
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
His adventure is in New Los Angeles City.

792
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Here's a quick screenwriting lesson here.

793
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
What if you got two characters at some point in the discussion,

794
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Nightstar should be mentioned at least once.

795
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Whenever Nightstar is in the room,

796
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
the subject of the matter should be about Nightstar,

797
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
and whenever Nightstar is not present,

798
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
everyone should be asking,

799
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Where's Nightstar?

800
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
This is the wrap to success.

801
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Okay, no, unironically,

802
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I should find any excuse to depict Nightstar.

803
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Whenever anyone talks about her,

804
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I should put a little face of her in the corner.

805
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Ben, have her dimension hop in.

806
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
She can do this shit.

807
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Have her pull at Chris and pop into the narrative

808
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
and lecture at length about...

809
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Whatever, I don't know.

810
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
She can pop out of the dimensional rift

811
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
just like Chris would pop out of a time void.

812
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
To punch that guy in Four Cent Garbage Towers.

813
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
You gotta have a legendary moment.

814
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Try and have a fake friendship lesson.

815
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Try and get back to Ponyville quickly

816
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
and just dimension hop in.

817
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Give him a lecture.

818
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I can tell that you're faking,

819
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
and then pop back out.

820
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
That'll get Chris's attention again.

821
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
It will.

822
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Just having Nightstar in the panel

823
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
is like, that's what it's gonna take.

824
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
We all know narratively,

825
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
the way you're writing it is better and good

826
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
to have these guys go do things.

827
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Nightstar is like the omniscient god

828
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
organizing all this stuff to happen.

829
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
The Rick, exactly as you said.

830
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Doing things and opting much more important things

831
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
and really shouldn't waste your time on this.

832
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
But you have to pay that cost.

833
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
You have to pay the piper to keep Chris's ear.

834
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
I mean, my purpose here is twofold, right?

835
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
There's the tie-in with Chris and Sonichu

836
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
and that cannon, right?

837
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
So that's the Nightstar angle.

838
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
But also, I want this to be a showcase

839
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
of New Los Angeles City and RFCK.

840
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Of course.

841
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
So right now, I'm focusing on the RFCK.

842
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
You should have Nightstar in, like doing a tour.

843
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Being like, wow, look at all these wondrous sights

844
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
and sounds of Neo Milwaukee.

845
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Well, did you see the part with Discord?

846
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Yes.

847
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Yeah, we're Discord.

848
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I think it's a lovely little town.

849
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
That's true.

850
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
It's pure chaos.

851
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm thinking of getting a summer home there.

852
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Ah.

853
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
And great Discord impression.

854
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Okay, one more thing about the Kiwi Farms, right?

855
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
This is the level of Kiwi Farms discussion.

856
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Like, they'll literally just make posts

857
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
like, they'll literally just post something

858
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
to be like, boy, Chris sure is stupid.

859
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Like, boy, Chris sure is delusional.

860
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Like, huh, Chris?

861
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Boy, he sure is delusional.

862
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,800
And it's like, yeah, great, great observation.

863
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Like, I'm so, I'm really impressed

864
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
that you were able to make this trenching point

865
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
about like the nature of Chris

866
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
and what's going on with that.

867
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Like, okay, fuck off, right?

868
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Like, yeah, we can move past this.

869
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
We can move past, I have moved past this

870
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
to more fruitful ground, all right?

871
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm doing something with my life, right?

872
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I'm actually doing something about it, right?

873
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Okay.

874
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
This is what separates the casual trolls

875
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
from the true Christians,

876
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
is being able to move past the surface and dig deep.

877
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Like, I get it.

878
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
It's wacky.

879
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
It's funny, all right?

880
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
We can all see that.

881
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
We can agree that that's true

882
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
and then move on to like, okay, what now?

883
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
What's next after we've all acknowledged this?

884
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
You guys are acting straight like level five crooks

885
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
when you need to be acting like level 100 bosses.

886
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
This is your main issue.

887
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Exactly right.

888
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Couldn't have said it better myself.

889
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Well, there's that.

890
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
There's the scoop, I guess.

891
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
There's the story.

892
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Not to monopolize the conversation or anything,

893
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
but the Kickstarter, the Vapors 2 Kickstarter

894
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
is going like gangbusters.

895
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
We're over, it's over 6,000.

896
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
At 666, we're doing communism.

897
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Everybody gets a dollar.

898
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Everyone who, well, and then I'm thinking,

899
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm thinking that the next stretch goal,

900
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
and I don't know when this is going to be,

901
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
it'll probably be a couple thousand beyond,

902
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
maybe eight or nine or 10, I don't know.

903
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
The next one, the next stretch goal will be,

904
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
you know, my St. Hart logo,

905
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
a little St. Hart in the circle.

906
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm just going to make that a pin,

907
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
but I'm just going to give it to everyone for free.

908
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Like, if we hit whatever the goal, the next goal is,

909
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
I think like,

910
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Oh, that reminds me.

911
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
New pin and everyone gets one.

912
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Everyone, yep, and that's just going to be a backer word

913
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
for everyone who backed the Kickstarter,

914
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
is just a new pin and everyone gets it,

915
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
and that's going to be a cool one.

916
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I've been thinking about making that pin anyway,

917
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
but I didn't have any,

918
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I didn't like where the fuck would I sell it under what,

919
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
this is it, this is the time.

920
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
So that's what we're going to do after the next stretch goal.

921
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I saw comments on our latest piece of the episode,

922
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
someone said like,

923
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
it's illegal to send money through the mail

924
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
because remember the plan you had with sending...

925
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I don't give a shit.

926
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
I don't care about that.

927
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I read that, I can't possibly believe that that's the case.

928
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I think it is like frowned upon,

929
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
if not outright illegal, but who cares?

930
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Nobody, yeah, I'm sure nobody sends like $1 bills

931
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
to send money for family,

932
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
for happy birthday, here's $20.

933
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Maybe they do gift cards.

934
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Sending money in the mail is like

935
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
making money off a Minecraft server.

936
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
It might be looked down upon, but nobody cares.

937
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
You're not supposed to do it.

938
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
But you're going to do it anyway.

939
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I did look at the terms of service,

940
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
because I was worried about this,

941
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
as like a Kickstarter terms of service thing.

942
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Did I talk about this last episode?

943
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I hope I'm not repeating myself.

944
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
No, I don't think so.

945
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Well, okay, I'll tell you.

946
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm interested.

947
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Okay, I thought maybe it might be

948
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
against Kickstarter terms of service, but it's not.

949
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
The things that are prohibited,

950
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
you're not allowed to build a Kickstarter

951
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
in such a way that backers will profit, right?

952
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Sure, sure.

953
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,800
You're not allowed to do a Kickstarter

954
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
where backing the project gives you

955
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
future equity in a business, you know what I'm saying?

956
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
But that's not what the...

957
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
And you're not allowed to structure

958
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
so that backers make a profit.

959
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
But that's not what I'm doing.

960
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm basically just giving a $1 refund.

961
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
And it's only to people who actually get a physical thing.

962
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
So you had to spend $15 and more.

963
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
So that's not what this is.

964
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
It's just a $1 discount in the form of a physical dollar bill.

965
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I don't think you're fine.

966
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
You might see it as.

967
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
So I'm pretty sure...

968
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
So there's nothing in the terms of service

969
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
that says that this is not okay.

970
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
You would have to like...

971
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
You would have to interpret it pretty...

972
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
You would have to do some acts of...

973
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
some pretty active reinterpretation to get there.

974
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
If you wanted to fucking fan me

975
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
and cancel me off this project.

976
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Maybe it's worth reaching out to them

977
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
just to make sure.

978
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
But I mean, it sounds fine to me.

979
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I don't fucking know.

980
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
All right, Ben.

981
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Here's the important question.

982
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
This is like everything we've been talking about

983
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
so far is leading up to this.

984
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Vapors 3 Kickstarter.

985
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Chris Chan, Vaporette, make it happen?

986
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Yes or yes?

987
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Dude.

988
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Dude.

989
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Now, can Chris really be expected

990
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
to generate something of this nature

991
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
to someone else's script?

992
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I feel like...

993
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm skeptical.

994
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I mean, Chris did do that one crossover page.

995
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
You know, she was doing the crossover

996
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
with like Planet Dolan.

997
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
But she did like one page

998
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
and then it fell apart.

999
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
So, you know...

1000
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
I feel like it would be an uphill battle

1001
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
to get that to happen.

1002
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
You got at least a year

1003
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
to figure it all out.

1004
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I think I just got another backer.

1005
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Did I?

1006
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Yes.

1007
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Yes, I fucking did.

1008
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Who is it?

1009
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Who is it?

1010
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Who is it?

1011
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Okay, it's a real name.

1012
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm not going to say the real name.

1013
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Their name's Chris, but it's not that Chris.

1014
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Oh, man.

1015
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Thank you.

1016
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Excellent.

1017
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Dab.

1018
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Dab.

1019
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Looking...

1020
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm very much looking forward to my rewards.

1021
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
What was it?

1022
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Oh, yeah, Planet Dolan.

1023
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Okay, I mean, I'm going to try it.

1024
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm really excited that, like, Chris wants to talk to me.

1025
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Even if it's just because she thinks that I'm her...

1026
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Oh, she messaged you too, Hippo, right?

1027
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Hippo?

1028
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Oh, Hippo's...

1029
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Oh, there it is.

1030
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Okay.

1031
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Like, even if it's just because she thinks we're her in

1032
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
with the analysis anarchy crowd, I don't care.

1033
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I'm excited to have this relationship.

1034
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I want to nurture it, right?

1035
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I want to water it.

1036
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Like the Truffula Tree.

1037
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Like the Truffula Tree in Needville.

1038
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Let it grow.

1039
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
And so, I don't know.

1040
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Yes.

1041
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Crossovers is Chris Chan.

1042
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Definitely happening.

1043
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Dab.

1044
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Dab.

1045
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Dab.

1046
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
That's what's up.

1047
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
That's what's up.

1048
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Okay, I've talked for a long time about my shit.

1049
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Well, that's cool stuff.

1050
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Hey, I've got an update to an ongoing...

1051
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Kickstarted.com.

1052
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Slash.

1053
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Project.

1054
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Slash.

1055
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Ben Slane.

1056
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Slash.

1057
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Vapors2.

1058
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
No spaces, no underscores.

1059
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
Type it in your URL bar right now.

1060
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Link in the description.

1061
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Link to charity and that charity is me.

1062
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
There you go.

1063
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
All right.

1064
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Be me.

1065
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Nate.

1066
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Best person on the planet.

1067
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I'm at the movies yesterday.

1068
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Me and Michelle, we went to see It Part 2.

1069
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Pretty decent.

1070
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Not terrible.

1071
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
It was okay.

1072
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
So we're watching it.

1073
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,800
As we're watching, having a good time and the nice comfy chairs they got.

1074
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I hear some loud voices like talking in the theater.

1075
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I've had very few experiences with people being loud in the theater before.

1076
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
But in this case, it was happening.

1077
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
It was like a seat directly behind us.

1078
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
It was like a few people.

1079
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
It was a few women making noise.

1080
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
And I was like, oh man, what are these?

1081
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm not going to turn around and look at them.

1082
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
It wasn't enough to be particularly distracting.

1083
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
But it was a horror movie.

1084
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,800
And I heard him saying things like, oh lord, don't go in there.

1085
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I wouldn't go in there.

1086
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
You're going to die and things of this nature.

1087
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
And I had a flashback.

1088
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I had a flashback to a few PCP episodes ago.

1089
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Where when Jesse, the man, Endless Jess was saying, black people be yelling at the screens.

1090
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
It's not racist.

1091
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
You know it's true.

1092
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
And I had a brain blast.

1093
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
I thought to myself, could it be true?

1094
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Could this possibly be the experience that Jesse had described previously on this very

1095
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
podcast?

1096
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Wait, were they of the black persuasion?

1097
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
I had no idea.

1098
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
I was just sitting there in my theater watching a movie.

1099
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
You had no idea.

1100
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I didn't turn around.

1101
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
I didn't turn around and look.

1102
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
I didn't want to be, I don't know, weird.

1103
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I thought you were going to bring up Jesse saying when he punched somebody in the face

1104
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
in the movie theaters.

1105
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,800
I thought you were going to fucking deck that.

1106
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Some people were making noise throughout the whole movie.

1107
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,800
I thought you were going to earn your name for a change, best guy ever.

1108
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
These people were making a bunch of noise.

1109
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,800
There was a bunch of women all together.

1110
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,800
The end of the movie, I finally trampled, turned around.

1111
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
And indeed it do be like that sometimes.

1112
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Black people do be yelling at the screen.

1113
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
And I just want to let everybody know.

1114
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,800
You've just set our culture back decades.

1115
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
It's true.

1116
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,800
It might have been the case, but you shouldn't say it.

1117
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Look, Emerson, it do be like that sometimes, of course.

1118
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
We can't make any generalizations here.

1119
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Cool.

1120
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
But I grew up a little bit that time.

1121
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
What a fascinating experience.

1122
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Jesse, I stand with you, brother.

1123
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
But that's it.

1124
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
That's my whole story.

1125
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
That's my whole story.

1126
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,800
And I'm using anecdote from the life of one great best man.

1127
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,800
Pre-conceptions confirmed.

1128
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Established for the first and very first time.

1129
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Yes.

1130
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I was like a virgin, untainted, but now I know.

1131
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Sad.

1132
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
All right.

1133
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
What else is going on?

1134
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Mage, Tom, what's new in your life?

1135
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,800
All I've been doing for the past week and three days is the stupid Minecraft server.

1136
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I wake up at 6 a.m.

1137
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
How dare you call it stupid?

1138
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,800
It's a great Minecraft server.

1139
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Stupidly brilliant.

1140
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
It's going to be a wonderful time.

1141
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Okay.

1142
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Yeah.

1143
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
I can tell you've been working.

1144
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
These screenshots you post, I'm amazed.

1145
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm amazed by what I'm seeing.

1146
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
You will see it one day soon.

1147
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
It's so cool.

1148
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
I mean, you will be blown away.

1149
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
I'm glad.

1150
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Really excited about it.

1151
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,800
The thing is, I haven't even just been building because there's like, I've never really hosted

1152
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,800
a server before.

1153
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,800
I didn't even know much about Minecraft hosting servers before I took on this thing.

1154
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,800
I thought it would be a bit faster or a bit easier.

1155
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Don't get me wrong.

1156
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Now that I know these things that I know, it is quite not as difficult.

1157
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,800
But when I just jumped into this and I was just like, and I don't know how to swim.

1158
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,800
I'm just like, oh my God, I'm drowning in this.

1159
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Me and Mage have been, she's been doing all the heavy lifting.

1160
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
I've been her test dummy on occasion.

1161
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Obviously she's worked 10 times as much as me, probably more so.

1162
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,800
When you see what she's done, I built myself a little house out to the south of spawn point.

1163
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm going to build a road out to it.

1164
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Finally established.

1165
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Come pay me a visit.

1166
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Am I a wonderful little house I've got?

1167
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,800
I said in the comments of the last episode that we would never abandon Bufalantopia.

1168
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Oh my God.

1169
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,800
Why would you lie to people like that?

1170
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Okay.

1171
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Well, you know, we will build a new and better Bufalantopia.

1172
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Bufalantopolis.

1173
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Bufalantopolis.

1174
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,800
I like Bufalantopia with the number two in there.

1175
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
We'll vote on it.

1176
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,800
And then I will fucking seize the means and ignore the results of the elections.

1177
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,800
One of the first things I did when I got into the new server for testing, I caught a Bufalant.

1178
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
I'm riding my Bufalant around.

1179
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Very good.

1180
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Very good.

1181
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Keep it going.

1182
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Okay.

1183
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
All right.

1184
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
We can make it work.

1185
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
And just for those who are crying about Bufalantopia, it's going to be obliterated in eight months,

1186
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,800
no matter what we do.

1187
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Less than eight months right now.

1188
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
So less than eight months now.

1189
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
That's server.

1190
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
That server is like closing.

1191
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
It's a ticking time bomb.

1192
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
Okay.

1193
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,800
Why would we live there?

1194
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
That's better to get out sooner.

1195
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah.

1196
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,800
So part of the reason, a very small part of the reason why we are making the server is

1197
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,800
just because I didn't particularly want to work on the Bufalantopia server, not the server

1198
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,800
of the town.

1199
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Just because I know it's coming.

1200
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
I knew the militia is coming.

1201
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
So why?

1202
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
It's a black cloud over our heads.

1203
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I was going to make the coolest house, but why am I doing this?

1204
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
By the time I'm done, it's just going to be erased.

1205
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,800
So Mage did indeed seize the means of production from the authority and has established her

1206
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,800
own kingdom now and it is a glorious one.

1207
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:35,160
One day, I spent one entire day just trying to program shopkeepers into the game that could

1208
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,800
sell the vanilla blocks and buy the vanilla minecraft blocks and it almost nuked the whole

1209
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
server.

1210
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
That's how bad it was.

1211
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Thankfully, I was graced by the presence of one kind stranger because I am in the server

1212
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
for the Pixelmon.

1213
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Sometimes I ask for help and don't always receive the help, but yeah, this one person

1214
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
was like, hey, I wouldn't mind looking at the logs.

1215
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
I have a minute.

1216
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
Oh, that's nice.

1217
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Yeah, and that minute turned into several hours and he didn't know why my server was

1218
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,800
breaking down and oh, that was so much trouble.

1219
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,800
I had to completely, thankfully, I made backups of the server before messing with it.

1220
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,800
So I made the backup, I started messing with it and it just kept going to shit.

1221
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,800
Every time I restarted the server, just more and more errors popped up.

1222
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
I was like, what is this?

1223
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,800
This is spreading this curse.

1224
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,800
I had to completely reset the server to the previous state I had saved, thankfully.

1225
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,800
I didn't do anything other than trying to mess with the NPC.

1226
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,800
It's like, how difficult can it be to just program a stupid NPC to stand there and sell

1227
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,800
blocks to you and buy blocks from you?

1228
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,800
And I told the guys, I'm going to scream if the error is literally just one misplaced

1229
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
comma or something.

1230
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Okay, and I was wrong.

1231
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
It was three misplaced commas.

1232
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,800
It was slightly more than that, but very slightly.

1233
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Just a few syntax errors, something like that.

1234
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,800
Like three commas, then one apostrophe or something like that.

1235
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
I don't remember exactly.

1236
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Syntax errors are the worst because you're just like, how am I so dumb?

1237
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Why is this not working?

1238
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
And it's just like, oh, I hit the wrong key.

1239
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
I was so tired.

1240
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,800
My vision was blurry.

1241
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,800
I was scrolling through like hundreds of lines of code trying to find the one misplaced

1242
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
comma.

1243
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Damn.

1244
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
It was awful.

1245
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,800
I'd like to take a look at this sometime, just for fun, if it's available.

1246
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Listen to all this pain that Mage has gone through, and you're going to sit there and

1247
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,800
not give us money on whatever we end up deciding to use to find this.

1248
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Fuck you, buddy.

1249
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,800
I mean, are we allowed to talk about what I'm seeing in these screenshots?

1250
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Yeah, but they're kind of the episodes that we're probably going to have a video posted

1251
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,800
showing off the server, so go ahead.

1252
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,800
I mean, I'm seeing.

1253
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,800
I mean, okay, I just, there's a fucking, there's a big ol' like battle arena.

1254
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
There's the saloon.

1255
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,800
There's an endless war made out of slime.

1256
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,800
The arena, there's the Royal Rumble Arena of PCP.

1257
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Okay, I don't know if this is like a mod thing or if they have this in vanilla.

1258
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,800
There are like light blocks, right, that are illuminated.

1259
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
I want to go in.

1260
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,800
I want to make his eye out of light blocks.

1261
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,800
I could, but the light blocks are yellow.

1262
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,800
I can make them as light as they can.

1263
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,800
What's the eye color of the pupil, the very center?

1264
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
I think it's black.

1265
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,800
You know, it's kind of open to it.

1266
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,800
The pupil's black, but like, it's open to interpretation, really.

1267
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,800
Just as long as it looks like an eye.

1268
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Okay, I'll do that.

1269
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,800
You won't be able to mess with stuff at the spawn, so all these buildings,

1270
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
you won't be able to break blocks or anything.

1271
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Actually, no, the eye is green.

1272
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,800
I did make it like, actually, it is kind of like a green glass

1273
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
that has like black borders around it.

1274
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,800
It's a fancy new block, so I nailed it both on both fronts.

1275
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,800
I mean, I might fuck with it.

1276
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
I might go in and just fuck around with it.

1277
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
You won't be able to.

1278
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
I don't know, but I can't.

1279
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,800
You can't.

1280
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,800
You won't be able to.

1281
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
No one can get in except me and Mage until they get whitelisted.

1282
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,800
But even after that, other than me, no one will have any sort of extra privileges.

1283
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,800
Not even if you're an ACP.

1284
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Oh, that's true.

1285
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Everyone's equal then.

1286
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Everyone's equal.

1287
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Except for Mage.

1288
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
I am God.

1289
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
I have privileges.

1290
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
You can't.

1291
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,800
If I wanted to make some minor cosmetic modifications,

1292
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,800
you couldn't just give me some temporary modifications or something?

1293
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
No, I can't.

1294
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
There's only two roles.

1295
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
The admin role and the default role.

1296
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
And making a new role is like too much trouble, honestly.

1297
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I don't want to bother.

1298
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
I can't.

1299
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Let me know what you want changed and I'll do it.

1300
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
I don't mind.

1301
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
I mean, that's fine.

1302
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
One spawn is done.

1303
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
You've made it a lot of work.

1304
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,800
These should be the whole start of the spawn point area with all our buildings that we've got.

1305
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Basically, this should be a thing where we modified at the very beginning.

1306
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
We can probably give Mage notes if things need to change.

1307
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,800
Actually, she and I changed a couple of little things here and there.

1308
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,800
But once that's done, this is done forever.

1309
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,800
The rest of the world can be modified at our pleasure.

1310
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,800
I actually spent a bit of today outlining the spawn area, so to speak.

1311
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:37,800
If you press J and open up the map, you'll see white dots outlining the area you cannot build in.

1312
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
That's very helpful.

1313
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,800
Yeah, directly outside of it, you'll be able to build.

1314
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,800
Okay, well, I might give you a couple of minor design notes.

1315
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:55,800
Okay, but each floor is a themed floor based on the gym leader that is inside the floor.

1316
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
That sounds incredible.

1317
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
That sounds so cool.

1318
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,800
It is incredible.

1319
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Mage has been an amazing amount of work detailing all the spawn area things with dope-ass items.

1320
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
I'm legitimately excited, and I fucking hate my friends.

1321
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,800
You all should feel excited.

1322
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

1323
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Go watch the video that's either up already or coming out soon.

1324
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
You will be excited.

1325
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,800
You will brain blast your fucking dick.

1326
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Suck on that.

1327
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,800
I can't wait to build my mud hut.

1328
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
My mud hut metropolis.

1329
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,800
Wait a minute.

1330
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Mage, you said you were building a place, a hole in the ground for PvP.

1331
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
What about the mud puddle?

1332
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,800
What about the mud puddle?

1333
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
That's a hole in the ground.

1334
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,800
I could.

1335
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,800
How should it look like?

1336
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,800
The mud puddle is basically just swampy.

1337
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,800
If you've ever seen a Dark Souls swamp, it's basically that, but with Germans in it.

1338
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
With who?

1339
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,800
Count me out.

1340
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,800
What's the reference?

1341
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,800
The reference is like the mud puddle.

1342
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,800
My Discord server is filled with Germans for some reason, and that's funny.

1343
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,800
That's funny.

1344
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Mage, you just got to look up a German flag somewhere.

1345
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,800
And you'll get some aesthetic reference.

1346
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,800
I guess I'll have to tell the Spaniards as well.

1347
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,800
It's a very EU server.

1348
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,800
I'm not sure if I'll be able to theme it properly.

1349
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Okay, I'll consider mudpull it, but I'm also considering the theming it RFCK because it is PvP sort of thing.

1350
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,800
We don't want everything to be all RFCK.

1351
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,800
That was how fucking I wanted the RFCK.

1352
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,800
They get all wrapped up in their little gang wars.

1353
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
No, it's thematically makes sense.

1354
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,800
If it's PvP, RFCK is PvP.

1355
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,800
I get it.

1356
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
I mean, we already have the Royal Rumble Arena.

1357
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
That seems like a good place for PvP.

1358
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,800
No, that's Pokemon.

1359
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
And that's not PvP.

1360
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
No, that's Pokemon battles.

1361
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
I mean, that's not RFCK.

1362
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,800
I was considering thinking maybe every now and then we can host Pokemon tournaments,

1363
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,800
and then I gift a Legendary or something to the winner.

1364
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
Yeah, it sounds great.

1365
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Actually, while I was building, Legendaries kept spawning around me from time to time,

1366
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,800
so I would capture them and they're going to be in my gift reservoir.

1367
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,800
I'm not going to keep any of them.

1368
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I see you've got a Xerneas and a Varisian here.

1369
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
I have such dreams.

1370
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,800
Listen to all this work you just done.

1371
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Listen to all the slaving away she's done for this project, and it's barely even like two weeks in.

1372
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:36,800
If you guys don't give money and join this project, it's clear that you just hate women.

1373
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
So if you don't want to.

1374
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Yeah, that's, you know, it's hard to dispute.

1375
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,800
I just think, you know, the fact that the economy values this work at $0 is unacceptable.

1376
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
This is why we need Yang.

1377
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,800
This is why we need UBI, you know.

1378
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
That's not true.

1379
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
This is why we need UBI.

1380
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
Vote Bernie.

1381
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
Vote Bernie.

1382
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Vote Bernie.

1383
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Vote Bernie.

1384
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,800
We, you know, talk of coding.

1385
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,800
I've been, I've been like half-heartedly doing a coding thing.

1386
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,800
And it relates to the mud puddle.

1387
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,800
I was using Java just because I don't know anything and I was sort of like fucking around.

1388
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,800
But I wanted to make a discord bot for my server called Endless Mud.

1389
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,800
And the only thing in my discord at the moment is that there's tears.

1390
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,800
There's rolls, which are just like burgundy blood, like all the bloods from the Hemo Spectrum from Homestuck.

1391
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Red Man Me has all the blood.

1392
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,800
And I can bestow blood upon others if they ask.

1393
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,800
But I kind of want like an endless mud bot to like give people the rolls.

1394
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:48,800
And just that in itself was like a gargantuan task because discord is not that easy to work with.

1395
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,800
There was a lot of tutorials and I burnt myself out.

1396
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,800
But I got this thing working where in my own personal server, if I run the bot on my computer, I have it open.

1397
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,800
Then I can type, exclamation point, get blood.

1398
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,800
And then Endless Mud will respond with, you get blood.

1399
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,800
And that's as far as I got.

1400
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
Nothing actually changes.

1401
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
There's no currency or anything.

1402
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,800
But that's, it's hard.

1403
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,800
God coding is hard.

1404
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,800
I couldn't even imagine like making something like Endless War.

1405
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Yeah, um, crack.

1406
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:35,800
You know, I try, I was like, I was like, I was like, I know, I'll open up a like a beginner Python tutorial and start from absolute scratch and try and make this spot.

1407
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
I can make this spot.

1408
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
It would have been so much harder than I thought.

1409
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,800
And then crack just came along and was like, I can make it.

1410
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,800
And like, I could never have done the stuff.

1411
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,800
Like, like, I didn't know anything about databases, right?

1412
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,800
It's all like database.

1413
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,800
It's database based and it's based.

1414
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,800
And um, I don't know.

1415
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
He fuck crack fucking made it happen.

1416
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I don't know.

1417
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
I don't know if anyone else.

1418
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,800
I mean, I don't know.

1419
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,800
It's fucking the point.

1420
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,800
What I'm saying is how it actually works like, like the nuts and bolts of it.

1421
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,800
That's like its baseline level, how RFCK works.

1422
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
It's like completely beyond my understanding.

1423
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,800
Like, like getting it to, to work with discord is the hardest part.

1424
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
And it's the first step.

1425
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,800
Do you know that took like three or four days of like dying at the computer?

1426
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Like, I just want to, you ever feel like when you're working on something that's

1427
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,800
stressing you out, it's like really difficult that you just sort of like heat up.

1428
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,800
And then the back, your back sort of feels prickly.

1429
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
Okay.

1430
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
Yeah.

1431
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Oh yeah.

1432
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
I know that in a way that you're getting frustrated.

1433
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
That's like, yeah.

1434
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,800
I think just doesn't work.

1435
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,800
You don't know like, oh my God.

1436
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,800
I know the, the hot.

1437
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,800
I know the heat, the heat of rage.

1438
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
Yeah.

1439
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
I want to, I got that a lot.

1440
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,800
I don't, my back doesn't get prickly, but I'm sure I have other physical symptoms.

1441
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
Oh, it's so annoying.

1442
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,800
And my back or like, like below the stomach as well.

1443
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,800
I just get so frustrated because of the, I feel like it more frustrated because of

1444
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,800
the heat rather than whatever upset me.

1445
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Yeah.

1446
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,800
It's like, oh, this is happening again on top of all this stress.

1447
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,800
I need to go outside and jump in a ice bath like.

1448
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,800
Yeah.

1449
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,800
I just want to.

1450
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,800
It's all that blood you have boiling over.

1451
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,800
I just want to quickly say to the editor of this episode, I'm, my audio might have

1452
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,800
distinct at least two times so far.

1453
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,800
I'm not sure.

1454
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,800
So just check in on that.

1455
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Okey dokey.

1456
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,800
We'll sync at the end.

1457
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Hopefully.

1458
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Sorry.

1459
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Sorry.

1460
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
My oblivion has had to deal with it as well.

1461
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Frile by fire.

1462
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Oh yeah.

1463
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
Okay.

1464
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
All right.

1465
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,800
It just like starts lagging and like HIPAA was lagging out really bad for me, but the,

1466
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,800
so I couldn't, I couldn't hear it most times.

1467
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
It should like reorient.

1468
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
I think it's mostly discord.

1469
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,800
Yeah.

1470
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Unless you're looking at the, the play head and it's sort of lagging itself.

1471
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Well, this, this is why we sync.

1472
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
This is why we sync at the beginning and end now.

1473
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,800
It helps.

1474
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,800
Yeah.

1475
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,800
I think I might have been partly responsible because of that because of the.

1476
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,800
It was me.

1477
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,800
It was, for some reason, my audio was, it would always like get like a second out of sync

1478
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,800
by the end of most episodes.

1479
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,800
I think some of it is to do with like the bit rate of the recording.

1480
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Like if our, if an audacity is like 40,000 something something.

1481
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,800
We should, we should all have like a hundred versus 48,000.

1482
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
Okay.

1483
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,800
After this episode, we should all like set the project rate, whatever, to a certain rate.

1484
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
So we're all on the same rate.

1485
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,800
I'm recording it.

1486
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,800
I mean, I don't know.

1487
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
This is inside baseball.

1488
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,800
This is, this is extreme inside baseball right now.

1489
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
They're not supposed to see this.

1490
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,800
Okay.

1491
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
Instead of this.

1492
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,800
It's just literally speaking out of the computer.

1493
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,800
I, when I look at these Minecraft images, I want to build, I've already got a house

1494
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,800
that's okay.

1495
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:47,800
It needs a lot more, but I want to build some sort of BGE face floating in the sky, smugly

1496
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,800
smiling down and everyone like a new son.

1497
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
That's one thing I want.

1498
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,800
And then also I would love to build a slime corp HQ skyscraper building somewhere.

1499
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,800
Yeah.

1500
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,300
I would hope that I can lie with the degenerates of the RFCK server and we can team up and

1501
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,400
construct this, this office building.

1502
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,800
It was extremely cold clinical, you know, no soul only calculated numbers.

1503
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,800
It's just a cube, just a cold steel cube.

1504
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Oh, that reminds me with that little logo on top.

1505
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:27,800
There are, there'll be like places in the spawn that you can buy within game currency.

1506
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Literally just in game, you won't be able to buy it with any other currency.

1507
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Just making it clear.

1508
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,800
Can we sell in game currency for real currency?

1509
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
No.

1510
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
You can sell it for slime corp.

1511
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Oh, but maybe we should make the server free and just fill it with Minecraft.

1512
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
That sounds like a great business plan.

1513
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
No.

1514
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
And ironically, it's whatever business is doing, right?

1515
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
No, no.

1516
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,800
I have such a grand vision of like, okay, let's say we buy like a little plot near the spawn.

1517
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
We build slime corp HQ there.

1518
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,800
But the thing is, you can make permission set so that only, like I was already testing this.

1519
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,800
Like you can have like pressure plates or switches that only activate with people you've given permission to.

1520
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:16,800
So we could give specifically access to slime corp HQ only to employees of slime corp and everybody else just gets kept out and they cannot even enter the building.

1521
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:22,800
There are slightly different sizes of the plot you can get and like the prices reflect that.

1522
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,800
So, you know, you gotta get a big one.

1523
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
Yeah.

1524
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,800
There's like fellow executives team up with me.

1525
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,800
Like the bigger ones and like the large ones are just for you to flex there.

1526
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,800
They are the most expensive ones and they're by the crew layer by the horseshoe crew layer.

1527
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,800
I haven't posted a screenshot of that horseshoe crew layer.

1528
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,800
I can't wait to buy the smallest plot I can get and just build like the tiniest little castle.

1529
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Just like the most minuscule little like just little purple stone tower or something.

1530
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,800
Speaking of Tiny Ben.

1531
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1532
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:02,800
My gun girl, the one of my cop killer OC.

1533
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:11,800
In Endless War you can create slimeoid pets and I made Tiny Baby Ben Saint.

1534
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I love it.

1535
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
I loved it so much.

1536
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,800
Tiny Baby Ben Saint's first day of slimeoid school.

1537
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,800
Make sure to kill anyone who fucks with you.

1538
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
Have fun.

1539
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Let me read the description of Tiny Baby Ben Saint.

1540
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Gun girl, you are accompanied by Tiny Baby Ben Saint, a one foot tall slimeoid.

1541
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,800
It is vaguely humanoid.

1542
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
It sounds just like me so far.

1543
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,800
Its face is a single huge eye.

1544
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,800
It walks on legs.

1545
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
It crackles with stored electrical energy.

1546
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,800
It is covered in a coating of slippery oil, again just like me.

1547
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,800
It can generate harmful frequencies with its brain waves.

1548
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
It is usually staring off into space.

1549
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Its dark purple hue gives it a brooding edgy appearance.

1550
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,800
It will huff and groan when given orders, like a teenage, like a teenage,

1551
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,800
rebelling against his mom in the most flaccid way possible.

1552
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,800
It has just a little bit of moxie, almost no grit, and almost no chutzpah.

1553
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,800
A pitiable baby, this slimeoid has no clout whatsoever.

1554
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
It has overalls adorned.

1555
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,800
That's the in-game description of Tiny Baby.

1556
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,800
It's adorable, please protect him.

1557
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,800
I love him.

1558
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
I'm honored.

1559
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,800
He's just such a perfect little guy.

1560
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,800
I always walk, exclamation point walks slimeoid.

1561
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
I would have to agree.

1562
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,800
And with the whole apartment things, I've got an apartment,

1563
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,800
and you can change the apartment description.

1564
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Something about him just makes me trust him.

1565
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,800
I have Gun Girl's apartment description.

1566
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,800
She's got a gun workbench and Tony Hawk Pro Skater and a PS1.

1567
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,800
Yes, we have real estate. There is real estate in RFC Canaan.

1568
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,800
Also, just outside the kitchen is a playpen covered in oil.

1569
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,800
Tiny Baby Benzane gets brought home after a long day of fishing and stuff,

1570
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,800
and she puts him in the playpen while she plays Tony Hawk.

1571
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,800
That's the law, and I really love it.

1572
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Speaking of real estate, I didn't get to finish about the Minecraft server.

1573
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,800
Sorry for going back to it.

1574
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,800
I'm just really excited because I said that people will be able to make claims

1575
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,800
and they'll be able to sell claims and buy claims and stuff,

1576
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
hence the little towns.

1577
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
I'm really excited, or at least hopeful.

1578
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,800
This is going to turn into a capitalist night.

1579
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,800
It's already going down there.

1580
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,800
I really hope that people will buy those plots and build really neat things

1581
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
and have a little town.

1582
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,800
Are they pre-existing plots that are set up ahead of time,

1583
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
or can you define your own plot and buy them?

1584
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,800
No, I set up because there's limited space in these spawns,

1585
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,800
so I set them up.

1586
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Smaller ones are cheaper, bigger ones are more expensive,

1587
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,800
and they're like the flex plots that I call them because they're super expensive.

1588
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,800
In all directions out, take a fucking step beyond spawn,

1589
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,800
and there's tons of space in there.

1590
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,800
I went south quite a ways to build my house.

1591
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Okay, I just don't know how this works.

1592
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,800
In the server right now, you can basically just go anywhere

1593
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
and just set up a plot for yourself.

1594
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,800
Can you still do that?

1595
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,800
Yep, this is just like...

1596
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Oh, this is like crime re-existing.

1597
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Yeah, basically if you want your structure to be in your spawn

1598
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,800
where everyone starts and stuff.

1599
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Okay, I get it.

1600
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,800
Is the map going to be endlessly spawning, or is there a cap?

1601
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,800
Because a map that keeps going will inevitably...

1602
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,800
There should be some cap.

1603
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,800
It should be really big, but there should be some cap

1604
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,800
because people like to travel forever in a server without a cap,

1605
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,800
and it lacks the server however many chunks have been created.

1606
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,800
I'll look into that, if you have a point to have and consider that.

1607
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,800
Just to reduce processing demands,

1608
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,800
putting a limit on the rendering distance.

1609
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
I have no idea how Minecraft works.

1610
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
Does that render stuff?

1611
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,800
But also, if people are so spread out, they won't interact as much,

1612
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,800
and we want them to be players in the game world.

1613
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,800
But it's part of the fun of Minecraft is exploring

1614
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,800
and finding your own little corner.

1615
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,800
Okay, alright, so we'll figure it out.

1616
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,800
We'll optimize.

1617
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,800
This server is going to be ribbed for your pleasure, dear viewer.

1618
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,800
It's happening. It's coming, so you better get ready for it.

1619
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
I'm kind of high for it, honestly.

1620
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
I'm looking in the Patreon chat here and there.

1621
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
I see people being like, you know,

1622
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
suddenly I'm getting that craving.

1623
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,800
I'm getting that craving to mine, and to craft,

1624
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,800
and to explore, and to spelunk, and to soar in the skies.

1625
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Can we set up a military police state

1626
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,800
that will punish anyone who mines at night?

1627
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,800
I think a faction should exist and be formed in this Minecraft world,

1628
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
specifically to do so.

1629
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Yeah, like, there's a team that goes out mining at night,

1630
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
and then there's another team that goes out,

1631
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
like, specifically to just, like, fight.

1632
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,800
You know, I was going to say,

1633
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
alright, the sun's going down, everyone,

1634
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,800
get your weapons ready.

1635
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Okay, quickly, PvP is disabled for the overall,

1636
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,800
but the PvP is enabled for the nether.

1637
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,800
So, like, so be careful in the nether.

1638
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,800
It's okay, though.

1639
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,800
These cops can still enforce the business.

1640
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,800
For example, if you catch someone mining at night,

1641
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
and you're an agent of the law,

1642
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,800
then, oh, I don't know,

1643
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
maybe drop a couple of stacks of TNT

1644
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
at important places in their mine,

1645
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,800
and just let loose, you know?

1646
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Let God do its justice.

1647
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,800
What's the thing with, like, in 2B2T,

1648
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
that people would, like, fight with beds?

1649
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
Oh, because they explode in the nether or something.

1650
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Oh, yeah.

1651
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
Yeah, you could fall asleep on the bed,

1652
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,800
like, yeah, you explode.

1653
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
I don't know how you fight with that.

1654
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,800
Like, that's the only way to, like, kill someone through.

1655
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
They're, like, fully upgraded diamond armor.

1656
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,800
It's, like, the, like, I don't know.

1657
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,800
It's a massive explosion.

1658
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Something about that, yeah.

1659
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1660
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,800
So, we'll work on that.

1661
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
We'll get that going.

1662
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,800
It'll be exciting for everybody.

1663
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
It's gonna be great, everybody.

1664
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
We've been working on it a long time.

1665
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,800
I've been playing around, goofing around in there quite a bit.

1666
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
Very, very happy.

1667
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,800
Very excited.

1668
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
All right.

1669
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,800
Well, any, what else is going on?

1670
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
We could just go to the voicemails.

1671
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,800
I mean, I got them ready to go.

1672
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:23,800
Hippo is, I don't know, he's got any shit to raise.

1673
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,800
Yeah, any developments, developments in anyone's life, huh?

1674
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Any juicy, juicy drama?

1675
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
No drama.

1676
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,800
I made soup today.

1677
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,800
That's the only drama.

1678
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,800
That's the only drama.

1679
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,800
I did, I have been marathoning the Angry Video Game Note again.

1680
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:50,800
He has those, the seasons of his show, which consolidate an entire year's worth of episodes,

1681
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,800
like season one to ten, I think.

1682
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,800
He's got more years than that.

1683
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,800
He's been doing it.

1684
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Season four and five, I think, is the peak.

1685
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:08,800
But watching all of those again really puts me, puts you in the mood to do the video game review thing.

1686
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
I've been thinking about it a little bit.

1687
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,800
Oh, man.

1688
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,800
I've been thinking about, like, it's not like I'm secretly, desperately wanting to come back and making videos,

1689
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,800
because I often have ideas that I'm like, well, too bad I don't like doing the video thing.

1690
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,800
I'll just, you know, think about it, and that'll be the thing I think about.

1691
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:34,800
But I do want, like, I would like a good reason to come back.

1692
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
I just can't think of one.

1693
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,800
Dark Cloud 3 comes out.

1694
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
The dream.

1695
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Because, like, I was thinking about, like, the point of the reviews initially.

1696
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,800
It was because I wanted to tell people about certain games that I like,

1697
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,800
and so that they know about them, and explain why they're good.

1698
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,800
And I just feel like that, like, ran its course, and I don't feel like I need to explain that,

1699
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,800
because so many games are completely covered by thousands of people.

1700
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,800
And there's, like, the only thing that's, like, could be unique is to do, like, obscure games.

1701
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,800
But I don't really give a shit about obscure things, if I don't know them.

1702
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,800
It was, like, a very limited thing from the beginning.

1703
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
Sure.

1704
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
And then there's, like, oh, well, do it for fame.

1705
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Like, YouTube fame is stupid. Do it for money.

1706
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,800
You'll never make money on YouTube. That's a stupid idea.

1707
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:32,800
Like, there's a lot of, and, like, content that is, it's just the reason.

1708
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,800
Like, I don't know. I don't know what reason I could have to make videos again.

1709
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,800
But it would be nice if I could find one.

1710
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,800
So you have the general desire, but no specific plan at the moment.

1711
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:47,800
I like the idea of having a legacy like AVGN that's, like, ah, remember Hippocrates.

1712
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,800
I mean, people do, like, occasionally, somebody references one of my videos, and I'm like,

1713
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,800
ah, you remember. I don't even remember.

1714
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,800
And it's, it's nice.

1715
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,800
I remember.

1716
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:06,800
And it's, like, I clearly don't have the same sort of clean record, because I stopped and started so many times,

1717
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,800
and it took such a long time for so few videos, and not all of them are, like, that great.

1718
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:17,800
I did a whole, like, tier list video of my reviews at one point on Give and Take.

1719
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
Right.

1720
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,800
But, like, if I came back and I keep making videos and they're good, and it's, like, really cool,

1721
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,800
then I, people would, it would be good, and it would be like,

1722
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,800
maybe you could get money and patrons from it, and I'm like, I don't know.

1723
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,800
I mean, yeah, you obviously did them because you enjoyed doing them, at least at a part.

1724
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,800
And I doubt that urge will ever completely go away.

1725
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,800
So, yeah, I mean, I eagerly await the next video, if and when, do you ever make one?

1726
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
Well, yeah, there's no plans, really.

1727
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,800
It's just sort of, if I ever do it again, I want to be sure that I know what I'm doing.

1728
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,800
Like, I could say, oh, yes, I'm making a show, and it's called Hippocrite,

1729
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,800
and this is the conceit of the show, and this is how many episode ideas I have.

1730
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,800
Like, if I was pitching it to, like, a TV studio or something,

1731
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,800
what is the purpose of this? I need to answer those questions.

1732
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,800
That's a very good point, and I think a lot of people, yeah, like,

1733
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,800
when everybody starts their YouTube with, like, a good idea,

1734
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,800
but as you keep going and you get into the thing of, like, I'm a guy who does YouTube now,

1735
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,800
then you're like, ooh, I gotta make something now.

1736
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,800
Gotta, like, find something, and then that spark can definitely go away.

1737
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,800
I certainly know what that is like, but, yeah, I mean, ultimately,

1738
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
you want to be in a place where, like, you're doing YouTube

1739
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,800
and you're purely doing the things that you love and you're passionate about,

1740
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,800
and I would say probably because you know that you'll be fine no matter what.

1741
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,800
And, like, if you've got, like, a great other career

1742
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,800
that, like, allows you to just do YouTube as a hobby

1743
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,800
and you don't need to make it successful, you can just do exactly what you want to do,

1744
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
that's a pretty great place to be.

1745
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,800
That's definitely the thing, like, it's in a hobby territory at the moment.

1746
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,800
It's just, if I, like, making something as long or as intense

1747
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,800
as, like, one of those skit heavy, like, YouTube reviews of stuff,

1748
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:08,800
then it would take a lot of time, and I would need a very good reason to spend that sort of time.

1749
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,800
And I feel like spending not so much time on it, making it, like, less of an interesting product,

1750
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,800
is, like, completely a waste of time.

1751
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,800
I'd rather, like, have a good idea and find the time to put it together

1752
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,800
than, like, come back half-heartedly and say,

1753
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,800
I'm just sort of, like, reviewing neurogames and with no visuals,

1754
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
like, or something stupid.

1755
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,800
I mean, having it be a hobby is always a good idea,

1756
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,800
just because you get that extra freedom.

1757
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
So, there's no pressure at this point.

1758
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,800
I mean, because you're already, you know, you're doing your professional quote-unquote work,

1759
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,800
so there's not any pressing need to, like, have a strict upload schedule or anything like that.

1760
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,800
So, you know, if you get the itch again, just throw something out and just let it be that.

1761
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
I've often thought about, I've never done this,

1762
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,800
but I've often thought about the concept of, we all have this urge,

1763
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,800
when we make a project, we want it to be, like, big and impressive,

1764
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:07,800
largely because we feel that, like, we've only got one shot to make our video on thing.

1765
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,800
But, like, well, let's say I wanted to make a video on, I don't know,

1766
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,800
uh, like, Fooly-Cooly the Sequels,

1767
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,800
which is something I've wanted to talk about at some point.

1768
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,800
What if I could make, like, I don't know, let's just say theoretically,

1769
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
I made, like, a wee-ag-wa on them or something,

1770
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,800
and then I'm like, those are okay, but I actually want to make a big video,

1771
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,800
and also make a big video that's actually good later.

1772
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,800
You know? That's, that's, like, allowed.

1773
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
You're allowed to do these things.

1774
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,800
But I guess you just don't want your initial work to go to waste or something.

1775
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
I don't know.

1776
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,800
Yeah.

1777
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
It's like, um, I don't know.

1778
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,800
You feel like, you feel like you have these precious feelings about your work,

1779
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,800
like, oh, I gotta make my, gotta make my thing and it's gotta be perfect.

1780
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,800
But, like, you know, I have that instinct too,

1781
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:57,800
but it's not a good instinct because, like, creativity is a river, right?

1782
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,800
It's not, it's not a, it's not a one single squirt.

1783
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,800
It's a, it's a, it's a continuous flow, right?

1784
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,800
And if you're, and you gotta be, if you're making stuff,

1785
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,800
if you're making stuff, making stuff, making stuff,

1786
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,800
that's how you make something good, right?

1787
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
The way that you make something good is that you're just making stuff,

1788
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
making stuff, making stuff, and sometimes some of it's good.

1789
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,800
It's not that you, like, stop everything and you just work on one thing,

1790
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,800
and you just make, and you do all this work into one thing.

1791
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,800
And then, and then because you worked on it so much, it comes out really good.

1792
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,800
That's just not how it works.

1793
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,800
My estimation of, like, the heights of human genius have become so low,

1794
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,800
like, in that way, that, like, a genius just stands up and does amazing thing.

1795
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,800
It seems like it's almost always extremely busy people

1796
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,800
or extremely prolific people who are just continually producing.

1797
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,800
It's someone who's been doing stuff for, like, a long, long time.

1798
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,800
And then, one day, they happen to do it in a certain way.

1799
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
That is, like, whoa.

1800
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
This is what's happening.

1801
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,800
I think, as we go on, that's gonna start becoming more apparent.

1802
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,800
I think the meme of, like, the genius is gonna die

1803
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,800
just because social media allows everyone to document what they're doing

1804
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,800
and everyone has, like, a history.

1805
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,800
So you can't just be, like, a flesh-in-the-pan guy

1806
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,800
because you'll have, like, you know, five years' worth of tweets

1807
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,800
of trying to do things before your big breakout success.

1808
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,800
Every fucking famous artist has, like, their embarrassing old deviant art

1809
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,800
of, like, where they drew fucking Ed Ed and Eddie Heddy.

1810
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
Ty, you go back up.

1811
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,800
There's this little person over here.

1812
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
Yeah, you all know who I'm fucking talking about, but you get it.

1813
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,800
And then some of those people continue to do that

1814
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,800
and make their career in that.

1815
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,800
Yeah.

1816
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Ed Ed and Eddie Heddy, yeah.

1817
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

1818
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
The brave, the few.

1819
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
The blue-haired girl.

1820
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
Uh, Lapis Luzuli.

1821
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
You know, the canker sister.

1822
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,800
I don't remember.

1823
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,800
I've seen those.

1824
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
I never actually watched much Ed Ed and Eddie.

1825
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
Oh, her. Yeah, I don't know her name. Lucy, I think? Lucy?

1826
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
No, I don't think so.

1827
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,800
Wait, maybe.

1828
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,800
Okay, whatever.

1829
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,800
It doesn't matter.

1830
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,800
Blue canker sister.

1831
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
I like the Johnny Test sisters.

1832
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
They're cuties.

1833
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
It's literally Dexter.

1834
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Just two of them and a female.

1835
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,800
The one with the straight hair.

1836
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,800
Canonically in Johnny Test.

1837
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,800
Straight hair one is hotter because the other one's like a tomboy.

1838
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
And who would like that?

1839
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,800
It's just shrug shoulders.

1840
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
Dab sweat off brow.

1841
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,800
Rings, you know, sweat out of blanket.

1842
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
Whip crack sound.

1843
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Well, I'm glad we have that figured out.

1844
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
That's it.

1845
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
You're welcome.

1846
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,800
I was going to just, I was just going to say like,

1847
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,800
the reason AVGN got me on this puff of thinking is because...

1848
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Mary, is that the motherfucking PCP?

1849
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Is that the motherfucking...

1850
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,800
Yes, Munchy.

1851
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Hello.

1852
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,800
Hey, Munchy.

1853
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,800
In my America, with the Republican in the White House,

1854
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
progress is podcast in this generation.

1855
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
I don't think so, buddy.

1856
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,800
You came to the wrong neighborhood.

1857
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,800
Oh, no.

1858
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,800
They don't make them like they used to.

1859
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,800
Hey, hang on.

1860
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,800
Gibb was finishing a point.

1861
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,800
Let him finish that.

1862
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,800
Yeah.

1863
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,800
All right.

1864
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,800
You interrupted me.

1865
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1866
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
Okay.

1867
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,800
The reason it was AVGN that got me on this sort of train of thought

1868
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,800
was because his videos, the subject matter never matters to him, really.

1869
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,800
Like it's either a game he remembers renting and it's bad,

1870
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,800
or it's just a game he's been brought attention to and it's bad.

1871
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,800
And he's always thought of it as like he's making short films

1872
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,800
of him playing a character called the Angry Video Game Nerd.

1873
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,800
And with a lot of other people, myself included,

1874
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,800
I came into it with like,

1875
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,800
these are my actual opinions about video games and all that.

1876
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,800
And like the character stuff was sort of like,

1877
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,800
I'll throw that in there because it's funny or it was never really the focus.

1878
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:40,800
The fact that AVGN has like this focus as this was a character he created

1879
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:48,800
and he's continued to, you know, to use that as like the basis of the show,

1880
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,800
he has a very clear understanding of what he is doing.

1881
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,800
And I think when an if I ever make anything like that again,

1882
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,800
it would only be because I have like an idea for a character,

1883
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,800
for a show, for it to be like an entertaining thing.

1884
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,800
And the video game stuff should like take a backseat.

1885
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,800
Otherwise, I mean, it's not impossible to like have it be the other way,

1886
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,800
but you'd need to be like very good at talking about video games

1887
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
like a Mathematosis or whatever.

1888
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,800
And I'm not actually that analytically minded.

1889
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
I'm more of a funny minded person.

1890
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,800
So like the entertainment, you know, it's just sort of cool

1891
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,800
because like the way he talks about the video games, the videos themselves

1892
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,800
are just very casual.

1893
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,800
It's just like he's a guy and he's saying this game sucks.

1894
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,800
Look at this bullshit. Fuck.

1895
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Angry video game nerd is an artismo, you know, he makes shit by hand

1896
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
and he has an idea of what he wants to make

1897
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,800
instead of it being like a sequence of like,

1898
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,800
what childhood game can I mine the experiences of in my brain?

1899
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,800
Like what can I like break out that I have like a sentimentality towards

1900
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,800
which is where all the heart and gold comes out from stuff like you and maybe John Tron.

1901
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,800
If nothing else, that approach is going to help with longevity

1902
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,800
which is exactly why he's been doing it for, I believe, 80 years at this point.

1903
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,800
Because as long as you're being a character, that character can react to anything.

1904
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,800
You personally, human being, have only had so many experiences

1905
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
that are worthy of mining for anything.

1906
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
I think that separation is really good.

1907
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,800
Not only for that content sort of thing,

1908
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,800
because it kind of divorces you personally from the work to a certain degree.

1909
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Yeah, it's smart.

1910
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,800
It gives you more flexibility.

1911
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:35,800
It's easier to get hung up on a certain video when it's your own opinions being broadcast.

1912
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,800
It's like, I got to get this video about my favorite game, perfect.

1913
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,800
But if you're just a character, then it's like, you know, it's not the same thing.

1914
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,800
You can sort of think of it as a product.

1915
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:50,800
It's also easier to dismiss criticism that are just like, you know, bullshit in the comments.

1916
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,800
You're saying you're retarded.

1917
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,800
You're like, yeah, the character is supposed to be retarded.

1918
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
Like, I'm not going to care about this anymore.

1919
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
Okay, that's all well and good.

1920
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,800
And I can understand like the pros of that, right?

1921
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,800
I understand that like, yeah, like his Nate said that that's great for longevity.

1922
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:09,800
You know, it can be way more stable a thing to do if, you know, it's more versatile like that.

1923
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:15,800
But isn't like the best videos ones where it's like a person really cares about what they're talking about

1924
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,800
and it's like a really like personal or even just interesting sort of thing like that.

1925
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,800
I can imagine that being way more filling and creating like artistically just inherently.

1926
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:35,800
Well, yeah, I mean, it's not that I want to emulate AVG and exactly, but it's just that aspect of like the videos are they're not all great.

1927
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,800
And there's certainly like an element of nostalgia there.

1928
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,800
Like I really like the older ones that I remember.

1929
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:51,800
But it's that that that ability for it to remain good to me after all this time and still be like entertaining.

1930
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,800
The fact that people like and it's just sort of like a nice thing and people react that way to my videos.

1931
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
And I'm like, maybe I don't agree.

1932
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:06,800
But I sometimes sometimes like if I had a good idea, it would be nice to make another video.

1933
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:14,800
And if I didn't have a good idea, like I don't at the moment, then I will just never say it just it just got me thinking about the whole thing.

1934
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,800
I haven't watched the Angry Video Game Nerd since I was in fifth grade and I remember not really liking it.

1935
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,800
So I think that like the idea of a character really just relies on like it being something that you're into.

1936
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Whereas like if it's like someone who's talking about something that they like really care about and really enjoy it, right?

1937
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,800
I feel like I can basically listen to any of that.

1938
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:40,800
Even if I hate the thing that they're talking about, their passion can often just come through and it doesn't really matter what it's about.

1939
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
As long as they're interested and I can watch anything.

1940
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,800
But if it's like a character, it's like it can go on for like a thousand episodes.

1941
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,800
But if I don't like it, then I'm just not going to watch it no matter what.

1942
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:59,800
I think that regardless of all of these like different things, the main thing that I want to make clear is that if I ever make anything in the future,

1943
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,800
it won't be to make a money out of it.

1944
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,800
It would just be if I have a cool idea and I really want to make one.

1945
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:12,800
Like longevity or like relativity or big money.

1946
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Like it's not going to sway me more than like having a really burning passion for making a video.

1947
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,800
Well, good.

1948
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,800
I don't know.

1949
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,800
That's the reason.

1950
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
Makes sense.

1951
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
Hey, that's my thought.

1952
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,800
It's me, Munchie.

1953
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,800
Munchie wears tiny hats.

1954
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,800
I'm recording you live.

1955
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,800
Cool guy.

1956
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,800
On my dormitory.

1957
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,800
I'm the scenic boss in Massachusetts.

1958
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,800
It's me.

1959
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
I'm in college.

1960
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,800
Remember how we used to have those long episodes where it's like.

1961
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,800
Yikes.

1962
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,800
Yeah.

1963
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
We're still doing it.

1964
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Yeah.

1965
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Yeah.

1966
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,800
And the evil, evil one.

1967
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,800
The evil one.

1968
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
Yes.

1969
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Agreed.

1970
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Well, now I'm here and now I'm going to, I'm going to get really loud and everyone's going to like bang on my door.

1971
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,800
It's going to be like that.

1972
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
Yeah.

1973
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,800
That's why I did that.

1974
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Yeah.

1975
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,800
That's why.

1976
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,800
Okay.

1977
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,800
All right.

1978
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
I don't remember that being the case, but all right.

1979
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,800
Yeah, it is.

1980
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
It is a joke.

1981
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,800
Fucking fake Nate fan.

1982
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
Anyway, I made that as a joke and you took it.

1983
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,800
You took like a hook line and sinker, Munchie, but whatever.

1984
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,800
Anyway, hey guys.

1985
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,800
Well, with hippos talking about creating, you know, thinking about the stuff that you're

1986
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,800
going to make.

1987
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,800
Oh, you know, I'm going to think really hard about the like, the, the, the, the, the, the

1988
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
artistic process of this one here.

1989
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
I'm really going to put a lot of thought in that.

1990
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
Listen, that's all like fake.

1991
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,800
And you know what?

1992
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,800
That's not even like just like, nah, bro.

1993
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,800
Nah, dude.

1994
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,800
Listen, guys, I've been on just like, I've just been coming.

1995
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
I'm going to love with you guys right now.

1996
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,800
My door room is just flooded with semen because I've just been having a fucking gay old time.

1997
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,800
Oh God.

1998
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,800
Someone's calling.

1999
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,800
Let's see.

2000
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
Let's get the speaker on.

2001
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
Yeah.

2002
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,800
Hey, what is it?

2003
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,800
Hello.

2004
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
Oh God.

2005
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,800
Jesus Christ.

2006
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,800
I love that guy.

2007
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,800
Yeah.

2008
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,800
Fuck that guy.

2009
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,800
Anyway, the point is, is that after coming to art school and interacting with all the

2010
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,800
people I have so far, I just come to agree that just to say that it's all been great.

2011
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,800
You know, I'm only like three weeks in, you know, I can't all describe what the experience

2012
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,800
will be like in like a month or maybe even tomorrow.

2013
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,800
But just, just so far, I've just, the synapses have been firing my friends.

2014
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,800
My heart has been beating.

2015
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:16,800
My mind has been just completely altered, like completely addled by all the substances

2016
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
and people that I've known so far.

2017
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
And it's great.

2018
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,800
And it's great.

2019
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,800
And I'm on the other side of the line.

2020
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,800
I'm on the other side of paradise right now.

2021
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,800
I'm letting you guys know that I'm in heaven.

2022
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,800
Like I finally figured it out what it was like.

2023
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,800
And it's great.

2024
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,800
It's great.

2025
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,800
Well, that's great.

2026
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
That extended adolescence of college is a hell of a time.

2027
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,800
You know, it's a great, it's a great experience.

2028
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Literally.

2029
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,800
What, what is your, your projects, your, your work?

2030
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,800
What's, what's you're doing?

2031
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
So some of it is.

2032
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
I mean, he's like a, he's like a freshman.

2033
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
Yeah.

2034
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
It's like a second week.

2035
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,800
It's not, it's not, it's not.

2036
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,800
I mean, like, you know, I want those pictures of Spider-Man.

2037
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I want those pictures of Spider-Man, Munchie.

2038
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
Get them on my desk now.

2039
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,800
I'm just, I'm just curious to see like what, like the, the experience of the learning,

2040
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,800
like how they teach you and what they're teaching you and stuff.

2041
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,800
So, well, it depends like a lot on like what the class is.

2042
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,800
There's no, it's sort of like, so the thing at this school, right, is that everyone starts

2043
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
out with the same freshman year.

2044
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,800
And there's like very selective that you can take to figure out what you want to major

2045
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,800
in down the road.

2046
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,800
And then once you get to your second year, then things really start to like get super

2047
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,800
niche and super specialized based on like what you want to do.

2048
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,800
But right now it's pretty general.

2049
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,800
So I'm taking stuff that may not like directly apply to any of your students.

2050
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,800
May not like directly apply to anything that I'm doing in the future, but will just be

2051
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,800
like sort of general skills that like I can, I can, um, not, not so, let me re, let me

2052
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,800
rephrase that.

2053
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:43,800
Not so much that won't be beneficial to what I do down the line, but more so is just a

2054
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,800
sort of generic thing that anyone can benefit from in any way.

2055
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,800
So I'm studying really basic things like, you know, I'm studying 2D space, how to do

2056
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,800
composition.

2057
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,800
I'm doing like sculptures and I'm doing stuff like that.

2058
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,800
That's like, you know, these are the sort of things that you can really take to anything

2059
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
and apply them in various different ways.

2060
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,800
So if you want to know very specifics, uh, I just bought a bunch of cardboard and I'm

2061
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:08,800
making like a cardboard, fucking mechanical, like weird, like, like utilitarian sculpture

2062
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,800
thing.

2063
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:13,800
Uh, so I'm going to be making tubes and shit right now and boxes.

2064
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,800
Sick.

2065
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Yeah.

2066
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,800
It's cool.

2067
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,800
It's, I feel like I'm two years old again.

2068
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,800
But it was like, it was like, uh, my, my, my roommate, um, Lorenz does architecture

2069
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,800
school and he's always like, he's always like building weird shit out of cardboard.

2070
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,800
I don't know.

2071
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,800
Yeah.

2072
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,800
I don't like it.

2073
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,800
Yeah.

2074
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
You're not into it.

2075
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,800
I'm against it.

2076
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,800
Yeah.

2077
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,800
I mean, I understand.

2078
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,800
I've never, I had like worked with colored pencils for the first time since like, you

2079
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,800
know, second grade.

2080
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,800
Um, that was cool.

2081
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
It's, it's cool.

2082
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,800
It's cool to have to, oh, you know what?

2083
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,800
Okay.

2084
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,800
Okay.

2085
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,800
Here's something that really just struck me.

2086
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
It was very, it was very interesting.

2087
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:56,400
So there's like a very clear divide and it's really interesting when you're able to like

2088
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:03,480
just see the amount of faces in my freshman class that I know I won't see like by the

2089
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,840
end of this year, meaning that I can clearly make out like the weeds.

2090
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,400
I can separate like the cream from the chaff so easily.

2091
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,960
And it's not like I have like a really, I'm like really like better than those guys.

2092
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,000
Like I'm like a really perceptive, but it's illustrated in the fact that like all the

2093
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,440
seniors and all the upperclassmen, right?

2094
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,920
They are like, you know, cool and, and really like, you know, interesting and kind of weird

2095
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,360
and kind of off being kind of the people that I imagined that I would see.

2096
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:36,080
And in my like dorm room, like my roommates and all my people in my floor, all of them

2097
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,880
are, and this struck me, they're all like Snapchat normies.

2098
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:45,360
They're all like, like really just like the most like generic human being I can imagine

2099
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,760
like in my life.

2100
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:52,880
And you know, like kudos to them, man, I'm not, it's just like, you know, it's just what

2101
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,880
I didn't expect.

2102
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,760
I thought people are going to be more well adjusted.

2103
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,760
I don't know.

2104
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,240
Yeah, they're just like, they go out to parties and things and like, you drugs and stuff.

2105
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,240
Oh, man.

2106
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:04,800
So fucking that's, that's bizarre, man.

2107
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,800
Who would have guessed?

2108
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Yeah, I know.

2109
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
I know.

2110
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,800
What the fuck?

2111
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,400
Um, no, freshmen suck, dude.

2112
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,400
No, freshmen suck.

2113
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,400
No, fuck it.

2114
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,400
You should haze them.

2115
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,400
You should start hazing all the other freshmen.

2116
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,400
You should start hosing them.

2117
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,400
Yeah.

2118
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,240
I basically take a note that anyone who does weed, I won't see by the end of sophomore

2119
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,240
year.

2120
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,240
That's, that's false.

2121
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,600
But okay.

2122
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,600
Yeah.

2123
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,640
There's, there's some people, but many, many, I agree.

2124
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:33,280
Many will, you know, those, those are the types who are likely to wash out.

2125
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,280
I'd say.

2126
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,760
Well, you know, it probably, you know what?

2127
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,280
It probably does make it more likely.

2128
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,280
It more likely.

2129
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,600
It probably doesn't make it more likely that they will because they don't have their,

2130
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,960
they don't have their, they don't have their eyes on the prize.

2131
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,960
I don't know.

2132
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,760
We weeds, weeds bad for your focus.

2133
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,360
Now the kids are doing Adderall.

2134
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,360
Those are the top of the class.

2135
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,360
The ones that are popping all the way.

2136
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,960
Well, you're speaking to yours truly.

2137
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,160
Oh yeah.

2138
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,160
How do you think I get by?

2139
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,160
Yeah.

2140
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
Anyway, I don't need to make this the school episode, but that's just obviously the most

2141
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
interesting thing about me that's happened.

2142
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,680
No, I talk for like three hours about Phantom Horn in New Los Angeles City.

2143
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,360
So have you been following that by the way?

2144
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,080
We shouldn't go on a whole other diversion of, I just want to know if you're, if you're

2145
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,080
keeping up with that.

2146
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,080
Yeah.

2147
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,080
Well, okay.

2148
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,080
So it's hard, right?

2149
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,080
Cause they don't go on Twitter.

2150
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,080
Yeah.

2151
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,080
So you just have to like ask Kazzie every day, like, is there a new page now?

2152
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,080
And she'll tell me yes or no.

2153
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,400
But there is a, there is a post that I keep retweeting that is just all the images collected

2154
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
into one Imgur album.

2155
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,400
Oh, okay.

2156
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,400
I've been snagging the link for that too, so we can put it in the show notes and shit.

2157
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,400
Yes, I will snag the link.

2158
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,640
I'll just bookmark that then, I guess.

2159
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,640
Yes.

2160
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,640
Yeah, do that.

2161
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,640
I mean, good idea.

2162
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:36,640
I can't wait for the Kickstarter for that comic.

2163
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,640
Oh my God, Munchy.

2164
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:38,640
I'll fucking print a book of it.

2165
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,640
Why not?

2166
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:46,960
Munchy, have you seen, are you up to date with Ben's comic there?

2167
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,600
Have you seen like the very last page that's been produced?

2168
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,600
Is it the one?

2169
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,600
Well, the last I left off.

2170
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,600
Let's just say it's an explosive page.

2171
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,600
Oh, yes.

2172
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,600
I've seen that.

2173
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,600
I've seen that.

2174
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,600
There's actually been two more since then.

2175
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,600
Oh, okay.

2176
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,600
I guess I missed those.

2177
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,600
Okay.

2178
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,600
I want to make sure you saw 9-11.

2179
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,600
Yeah, no.

2180
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,600
I definitely saw 9-11.

2181
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,600
Spoiler.

2182
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,600
Oh, sorry.

2183
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,600
Oops.

2184
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,600
Oops.

2185
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
It was the best one yet.

2186
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:15,520
Oh, by the way guys, sorry, let me just, on the 7-9-11, did you guys see the arch that

2187
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,040
someone made for us on Twitter of our character 9-11 in full green screen?

2188
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,040
No.

2189
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,040
It was sent to us on 9-11.

2190
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
Yeah, you posted it on 9-11.

2191
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,040
And then you in some chat was like, I don't know if we should have refweeted this today.

2192
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,040
I did not.

2193
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,480
Look, on 9-11, people are actually sad and like, you know, grieving.

2194
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,480
Yeah, fuck them, dude.

2195
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:35,960
After that, it's fine, but I just didn't want to, you know, it's actually a day of grieving

2196
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,760
for real people, which I'm not one of.

2197
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,760
For babies.

2198
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,760
For baby people.

2199
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,760
It's over.

2200
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,760
It's old.

2201
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,760
I get it.

2202
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,760
I get it.

2203
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
I just don't care.

2204
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's funny.

2205
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I mean, I agree.

2206
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It's funny.

2207
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's hilarious.

2208
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
But, you know.

2209
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,840
But by the way, I just wanted to say that Ben, about that comic, I, this is something I've

2210
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,160
been thinking about a lot lately, but first of all, Endless War, as I do every single

2211
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,040
day of my fucking life, just thinking about it.

2212
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,720
But in relation to like an Endless War comic and stuff, it's just so like, Endless War

2213
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,440
is the best like inspirational tool ever.

2214
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,280
Like you can just like think about it for a second and then just ideas just start to

2215
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,400
flow from your fingertips and your mind and your cock.

2216
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:22,000
Like there's just so many different ways that you could take it that it's just like, I think

2217
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,160
like the, like, I'm going to describe like the quickest from like thought to creation

2218
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,880
that I think can happen.

2219
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,400
Like as soon as I get it in this war idea of any kind, like an update for it or an extra

2220
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,600
curricular thing, I just like immediately like, okay, this is just like completely taken

2221
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,600
over my mind.

2222
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,600
Like I can't think about anything else.

2223
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,480
I'm just going to do this because it's like the best idea anyone's ever had.

2224
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Yeah.

2225
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,000
That's the plan.

2226
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,640
That's the plan, baby.

2227
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,160
Munchy, Munchy, have you had that moment at school yet?

2228
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,160
I'm wondering if this has happened yet.

2229
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,440
Have you had that moment where the, your contemporaries have realized just how much better you are

2230
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,440
than them yet at, you know, doing stuff in real life?

2231
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,360
Well, I mean, I mean, you're a freshman, so you're surrounded by other freshmen.

2232
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:08,760
So I have no doubt in my mind that plenty of your contemporaries are just complete hacks

2233
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:14,640
who do not belong there and will drop out when they realize that it is not for them.

2234
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:23,040
I saw the funny fucking cartoon, Pro-Mare, and I went to a premiere or just a showing

2235
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,920
in Boston and it was great and we can talk about that maybe.

2236
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:31,720
But the point of that is I went with three classmates and I went there just to have fun,

2237
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,880
you know, hang out.

2238
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:40,280
And I, after the movie, I was stopped not once, but twice by two separate fans who

2239
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,600
asked me to take pictures with them in front of my classmates.

2240
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,760
And by the way, I had been trying to keep my, like, all of my art online, like a secret

2241
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,760
from all of them.

2242
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,760
Like, I went intentionally trying to not let anyone know my power level.

2243
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

2244
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,840
And so, like, I was intentionally dodgy, like, as much as I could be.

2245
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,280
And so, then, like, they see, like, all these, like, people, like, like, line up for photos

2246
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,280
with me.

2247
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:10,040
Munchy, you were both lording that club and holding court simultaneously.

2248
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,040
Yeah.

2249
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,560
They were dripping wet after seeing this spectacle.

2250
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,560
I have no doubt about it.

2251
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,480
Did your classmates ask him up?

2252
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,960
Yeah, they were like, what?

2253
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,960
It is that.

2254
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,960
I was like, I just make stuff online.

2255
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,960
Oh, my God.

2256
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,960
Yeah, play a coy boy.

2257
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
That's the way.

2258
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:24,960
That's the way.

2259
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,960
Keep him guessing.

2260
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,960
Yeah.

2261
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,280
You know, they think you're the coolest guy, as of that.

2262
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:34,480
Well, that's how you get hired by, like, Heart to Network.

2263
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,480
Yeah.

2264
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,480
By lording the club.

2265
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:43,720
Anyway, so I basically, like, have, yeah, tried to keep everything a secret.

2266
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:50,680
Oh, oh, hey, actually, so speaking of endless war and school, actually, so I have, I came

2267
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:55,560
to the school knowing that, like, the first, like, month or two is just gonna be me trying

2268
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:01,320
to pan for gold as fast and as hard as I fucking can, like, I'm fucking a cat or something.

2269
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,280
So I'm just, I've been going to, like, every single club and extracurricular activity in

2270
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,560
every class and everything that I possibly can to, like, analyze the situation, look

2271
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,840
at everyone that's, you know, in the club or just around me, like, rapid fire, like,

2272
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,840
hey, what's up?

2273
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,840
They respond in two words.

2274
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,360
I can tell if I'm gonna like them or not.

2275
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,360
Yeah.

2276
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,800
Obviously, that's the latest, you know, obviously, there are gonna be people that are gonna be

2277
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,000
lost through cracks right there.

2278
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
People are gonna say something, you know, weird or awkward, and I would have liked

2279
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,720
them a lot, but I just didn't give them the time of day because I'm a fucking asshole.

2280
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,280
Yeah, listen, I understand, I know, that's, that's what the rest of the years are for.

2281
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,600
Right now, I'm trying to build a solid base for which I can jump off from, like, listen,

2282
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,080
you know, it's, you know, am I an asshole?

2283
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,080
Sure, whatever.

2284
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,080
Fuck you, it doesn't matter.

2285
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:44,200
The point of this is that I've been going to a bunch of clubs and in order to get a bigger,

2286
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:49,560
you know, like, just as many people in front of me and get to know as many people as possible,

2287
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,560
I have made a Discord server, and you know what this is?

2288
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:58,440
It is an endless war clone themed after my school, so I've, like, I have, like, coded

2289
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:03,320
my own, like, personal, like, weird, like, offshoot spinoff of endless war, and I've

2290
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:07,480
just made it in this thing so I can, like, introduce all the people in my school to not

2291
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:11,240
only endless war, but also me, and then we can, I can, like, lord over to them the fact

2292
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,040
that I've made something cool and that they'll have to cry.

2293
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:17,800
This is just for, like, people you know from school and...

2294
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,920
No, I'm posting up flyers and posters and stuff like that.

2295
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,920
Oh, okay.

2296
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,920
Oh, also, wait.

2297
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,920
Are they supposed to kill each other?

2298
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,920
Yeah, no, they kill each other.

2299
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,920
Oh, thank god.

2300
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,920
Well, technically, they make each other drop out.

2301
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,920
There is slime, though.

2302
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,920
Okay, okay.

2303
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,920
Well, also, wait, wait.

2304
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,920
How long is there slime?

2305
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,360
Quick aside, quick aside, by the way, I went to a socialist club, and I went to a place

2306
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,360
called...

2307
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,360
Wait, a socialist club?

2308
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,360
Yeah, I went to a thing called the Finway Socialists.

2309
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,360
Very nice.

2310
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,360
Oh, okay.

2311
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,360
Media.

2312
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
And you should come with me next time.

2313
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,360
Should I actually?

2314
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,360
Yeah, I was allowed.

2315
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,400
I mean, it was basically...

2316
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,360
It was boilerplate shit that, like, I've heard a thousand times before, and they didn't really

2317
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,360
care.

2318
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,360
But you know what?

2319
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,360
Okay, great.

2320
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,360
Cool.

2321
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,360
Sign me up.

2322
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,360
I mean, maybe I'll...

2323
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,360
Your friends have been for so long before it all becomes boilerplate.

2324
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
That's right.

2325
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,360
That's right.

2326
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:05,360
You know, I was just scrolling through the mentions on the PCP and my personal Twitter,

2327
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,360
because I think he sent it to both of us.

2328
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,120
I cannot find this 9-11 image.

2329
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,120
I'm worried that this person felt the need to, like, delete it, because they felt, like,

2330
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,360
uncomfortable about it.

2331
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,240
Bro, please don't.

2332
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,720
Just bring it back if you did.

2333
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,000
I don't even remember who it was who made that.

2334
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,840
But I'm mildly concerned that they felt like they shouldn't have done it or something.

2335
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,160
But no, it's hilarious.

2336
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,160
Don't apologize.

2337
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,160
Don't delete...

2338
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,160
Unless I'm wrong.

2339
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,160
Do what makes sense.

2340
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,000
Please link it to me.

2341
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,160
I want to retweet it.

2342
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,160
It's hilarious.

2343
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,160
Oh.

2344
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,800
You probably didn't see this since you're not on Twitter, but I made a really funny drawing

2345
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,480
yesterday, and I want to tell you about it.

2346
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,960
Was it the church where you were?

2347
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

2348
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:43,960
I saw that one.

2349
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,760
Listen, okay, that's a fine image and all.

2350
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,600
But you gave Tirstworthy a shirt.

2351
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,600
And that's just...

2352
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,600
That implies that he's, like, a furry.

2353
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,440
That implies that he wears clothes, and I'm, like, really not about that.

2354
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,440
I'm really upset about that.

2355
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,440
You're right.

2356
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,440
No, you're right.

2357
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,440
No, this is not canon.

2358
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,440
Hopefully that can be retconned immediately.

2359
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:03,040
And Tirstworthy, actually, he wears a headband, right?

2360
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,040
Yeah, yeah.

2361
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,960
He wears, like, a Ryu headband.

2362
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,960
Yeah.

2363
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:07,960
This was...

2364
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,960
I mean, I just had to communicate that he's a rowdy, and that he wasn't a fucking tie-wearing

2365
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,960
Republican.

2366
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,960
He's not a GOP, remember?

2367
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:14,960
Yeah.

2368
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,960
Yeah.

2369
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,960
I mean, those get mixed up all the time.

2370
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,880
Dimension C197 is the cop killer shooting Tirstworthy.

2371
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,280
Dimension 1218 is Ben St., killing the GOP.

2372
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,000
The joke is that they're both elephants.

2373
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Get it?

2374
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Because Grand Old Party, the Republicans, elephants.

2375
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Very funny.

2376
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Yes.

2377
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I had to...

2378
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I had a fucking brain blast, right?

2379
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I had to...

2380
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,160
I was like, I have to make this connection in a new way that makes people make a new

2381
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:40,200
realization about the world and makes them go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2382
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:45,440
Tirstworthy picture in the show notes is Tirstworthy with his mother back in Africa.

2383
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,440
That's great.

2384
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,440
Why is it giving me this...

2385
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,440
Oh, it's...

2386
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,440
Okay.

2387
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,440
He's shooting fucking guns.

2388
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,440
Oh, I see.

2389
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,120
By the way, Munchie, Munchie, tell me you've been to the Promised Land.

2390
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,680
Tell me you've been to the Anime Club.

2391
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,680
Please, I need to hear these words.

2392
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,680
Okay.

2393
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,680
There isn't one.

2394
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,680
There isn't one.

2395
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,680
What?

2396
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,680
You need to found the Anime Club then, Munchie.

2397
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
No, no, me.

2398
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,680
This is your job.

2399
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:09,960
The reason why there isn't one is because Anime Club is just the school name.

2400
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:15,240
Literally everyone is that person that you would see at Anime Club.

2401
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,240
I'm just curious.

2402
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:20,760
In my school, there was an Anime Club and it was a Japanese culture club.

2403
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Does that exist?

2404
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,760
I'm just curious.

2405
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,760
No, there's nothing like that.

2406
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,760
All the clubs are very...

2407
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,760
So they hate Japanese.

2408
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,760
They're racist.

2409
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,760
They want to re-enact World War II, Hirasaki, Nagashima.

2410
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,760
I got it.

2411
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:37,160
There's a weird preponderance of Chinese people at the school, not really ethnic.

2412
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,960
I'm saying literally like from China, like they are from the country.

2413
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,560
Like their English and stuff.

2414
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,360
Don't they say that America's chief export is education or something?

2415
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,360
Is Chinese people?

2416
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,360
Yeah.

2417
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,360
We might have them, we ship them off.

2418
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,360
I don't know.

2419
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,360
So I've been to a few clubs.

2420
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:03,560
Chief among them is the Game Design Club, the Game Jam Club, which was cool, fine, maybe,

2421
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,560
whatever.

2422
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,160
I went to a comic club and the comic club was like, okay, I'm going to make like a really

2423
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:14,760
like fucking like funny ass, like lame ass, normie comparison to an anime that I've seen.

2424
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,360
I think you guys have seen Mob Psycho 100 probably.

2425
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,360
You know that?

2426
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,360
I don't even know what it's called.

2427
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,360
The club that like does nothing, you just waste time.

2428
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,360
That's the comic club.

2429
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,360
I tell them to use this club or whatever it's called.

2430
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,360
The Psychic Club.

2431
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,360
Yeah.

2432
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,360
Yeah, that.

2433
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,360
Okay, it's that.

2434
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,360
So it's just like people like show up and they're like, yeah, so like I've been working

2435
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,160
on like this characters for like 10 years and like I like I like written down something

2436
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,560
but I was hoping someone else here could draw it for me.

2437
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,660
Like I'm thinking that we could like collaborate and like that's that's what it's like.

2438
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,360
That's what people that's my heart.

2439
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,160
That's what it's my one call for a wish.

2440
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,660
That's what people who want to get into comics are like, they are script writers who need

2441
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:51,260
an artist to draw their shit for them for exposure.

2442
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:54,360
This is that it's an it's an epidemic.

2443
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,160
It was like it was like that at my school.

2444
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,160
I mean, we didn't have a comic club, but there were there were people like that.

2445
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,660
But I have this great idea for a comic.

2446
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,160
I just need someone to draw it for me.

2447
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,160
There you go.

2448
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,160
I need something to do all the work for me.

2449
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,160
Pretty much.

2450
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:10,160
You're sizing them up much so you know these people can be thrown directly into the trash

2451
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,160
and moved on.

2452
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,160
Yeah.

2453
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,160
It's also all okay.

2454
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,160
Listen.

2455
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,160
All right.

2456
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,160
Also this is an art school.

2457
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,160
So why the fuck are they doing that there?

2458
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,160
They should know how to fucking draw.

2459
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,160
People think art school is fucking easy.

2460
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,160
Maybe they're in the writing program.

2461
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,160
That's the reason.

2462
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,160
Yeah.

2463
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,160
Yeah.

2464
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:28,160
They say you have to go to a college and it's like, I guess drawing's easy.

2465
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:32,160
I'll go to art college and then a bunch of people come to an art college.

2466
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,160
They realize it's hard and then they leave.

2467
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,160
Yeah.

2468
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,160
Okay.

2469
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,160
Let me go to art school.

2470
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,160
If I did, I did the exact same thing.

2471
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:45,160
The thing with like freshman year, like there was a bunch of like normal people in there

2472
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:50,160
who did not give a shit and they they just enjoyed like acting as if they were still in school

2473
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:55,160
and like enjoyed, enjoyed posting about how much they're not doing their homeworks.

2474
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,160
Like I haven't even done it yet.

2475
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,160
Yeah.

2476
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,160
And it had a lesson shit.

2477
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,160
Oh, it's terrible.

2478
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,160
It's horrible.

2479
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,160
Okay.

2480
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,160
Yeah.

2481
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,160
Okay.

2482
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,160
It's so weird because it's such like a weird paradigm, right?

2483
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:08,160
Where I talk to the people and they're like, oh, my fucking teacher sucks.

2484
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,160
I have to do homework.

2485
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,160
I have to draw an art school.

2486
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,160
What the fuck?

2487
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,160
Oh, damn.

2488
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,160
And I'm like, I am like, my mom didn't make me come here.

2489
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:18,160
Like this was my parents decision to come to this school.

2490
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:21,160
Like I like came here of my own accord to like, you know, participate.

2491
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,160
How do those people?

2492
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:26,160
I mean, this is why when we like, when we would always talk about college, we're always like,

2493
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,160
we have a goal.

2494
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:29,160
Don't just go for no reason.

2495
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,160
Yeah.

2496
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,160
Yeah.

2497
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,160
And so it's like, it's so literally who just like mindlessly went there.

2498
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,160
There are other decisions in life and rack up dead.

2499
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,160
Yeah.

2500
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,160
All that business.

2501
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,160
Okay.

2502
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:42,160
Let me know if this is like bad of me to get annoyed at.

2503
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,160
So I'm at the comic club, right?

2504
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:49,160
And I'm talking to people and one of the girls there is like, dude, she like, she just like

2505
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,160
doesn't want to do comics.

2506
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,160
You know, she's just there to like hang out and talk about like fucking cartoons or whatever.

2507
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,660
And she's like, guys, you know what?

2508
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,660
I love Samurai Jack.

2509
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:59,660
Somehow the talk of Samurai Jack comes up and she just talks about how much she loves it

2510
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:03,660
and about how it's like her favorite thing about how she just, oh, she's such a Samurai

2511
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:04,660
Jack fan.

2512
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,660
Fuck yeah.

2513
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,660
It's finna fleek, bro.

2514
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:11,660
And then, and then it's, and then someone else asked like, oh, have you seen season five?

2515
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:14,660
And they're like, I've only seen season five and adult swim.

2516
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:19,660
I've only seen like the newest, latest, most mainstream version of this thing.

2517
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:23,660
Is I, is it okay for me to want to kill that person?

2518
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,660
Absolutely.

2519
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:25,660
Absolutely.

2520
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:30,660
I mean, the elitist about your media is one of the fine joys of life.

2521
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:34,660
It's one of the most wonderful experiences that you and me can have.

2522
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:41,660
I feel like Samurai Jack is old enough and I assume it's not on TV in the rotation anymore.

2523
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:46,660
And it's been like that for long enough that it's like, I don't, I don't think it's like

2524
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:49,660
that fair to like shit on them immediately.

2525
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,660
Like you can, you can tell them.

2526
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,660
I mean, they can Google search, watch Samurai Jack online.

2527
01:46:56,660 --> 01:47:00,660
Maybe you should watch the old ones.

2528
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:01,660
Yeah.

2529
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:03,660
And you can feel superior to them because they haven't thought of it.

2530
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:04,660
You know what?

2531
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:05,660
I'm going to, I agree.

2532
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:09,660
I think it would be the real crime would be if you were like, if they, if they were like,

2533
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:14,660
I haven't watched the old ones and I never will like fuck that.

2534
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:15,660
Right.

2535
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:16,660
Right.

2536
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:20,660
But probably like if they liked season five and they're just excited about it and maybe

2537
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:23,660
they'd want to see the first and they just haven't gotten around to it yet.

2538
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,660
I mean, that would be fair.

2539
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:25,660
That would be fair enough.

2540
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:31,660
Well, I feel like I don't begrudge anyone for not starting Samurai Jack at the beginning.

2541
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,660
And then this, you know, this isn't just Samurai Jack.

2542
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,660
This can be anything again.

2543
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:37,660
I don't have any religious Samurai Jack, but like it's not the fact that like they just

2544
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:40,660
watched that season and not the rest and they aren't a real fan.

2545
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:44,660
It's the fact that they like go, they went on and on about how they are a real fan.

2546
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:45,660
Yeah.

2547
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,660
That's what I like.

2548
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:47,660
This is safe.

2549
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,660
But no one heard me say anything.

2550
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:50,660
Lol.

2551
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,660
Get wrecked.

2552
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:52,660
Yeah.

2553
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:53,660
Yeah.

2554
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:54,660
Exactly.

2555
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:55,660
Sure.

2556
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,660
Sure.

2557
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:57,660
Sure.

2558
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,660
Sure.

2559
01:47:58,660 --> 01:47:59,660
Sure.

2560
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:00,660
I mean, I mean, you know, I guess it would depend, right?

2561
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:01,660
There.

2562
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,660
Yeah.

2563
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:03,660
I guess it would have to depend on like, I would have to been there and heard her spiel

2564
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:04,660
to be like, this is weird.

2565
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:08,060
It's weird that you're talking about yourself this way when you haven't even seen four fifths

2566
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,060
of the show.

2567
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:15,540
Uh, was it like, was it like people were saying, are you, you're not a real fan?

2568
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,020
If you've only seen the fifth one, she's like, no, I am a real fan.

2569
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:21,740
Or is it she just talked about how she's a real fan out of nowhere?

2570
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:27,140
There's definitely would be a weird way to do it.

2571
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:31,100
Someone was like, like they were listing off the things that they like about themselves

2572
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:34,300
and they're like, oh, I used to watch Samurai Jack as a kid and the other person was like,

2573
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,260
oh, do I fucking love Samurai Jack?

2574
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,260
And then they went off.

2575
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:47,500
Oh, that reminds me of a thing that happened like, back when Final Fantasy had been children

2576
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,060
released.

2577
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:50,060
I watched it and I loved it.

2578
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,060
I loved it.

2579
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,060
You're the only one.

2580
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,060
You're the only one.

2581
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,060
At the time.

2582
01:48:54,060 --> 01:49:01,060
To be, I've never played any Final Fantasy games, still haven't, sadly.

2583
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:05,420
I've only seen that one movie and I just absolutely fell in love with Vincent Velland.

2584
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:06,420
Oh my God.

2585
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,420
Jesus.

2586
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,420
That's such an amazing thing to do.

2587
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:15,540
I remember I talked to people just about how much I loved Vincent Velland.

2588
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,540
I knew his height.

2589
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,540
I knew everything about him.

2590
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:24,420
I'm played and I feel like I might be the only person in the world who played Final Fantasy

2591
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:30,500
7, Durage of Cerberus, which was the, oh yeah, I knew about this game solely because I liked

2592
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,500
Vincent Velland.

2593
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:38,100
It is just a very polished, very pretty shooting gallery, but it is the fucking side story about

2594
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:45,340
Vincent Valentine, who is the edgiest boy in this, even in the post-Cyberpocalypse of

2595
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:48,420
the Final Fantasy 7, Vincent Valentine is the edgiest boy.

2596
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:49,420
Yeah, pretty much.

2597
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,420
I love him so much.

2598
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:51,420
I mean, he's pretty cool.

2599
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,420
I still do.

2600
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,420
I still like him too.

2601
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,660
Yeah, Durage of Cerberus is not a great game, but whatever.

2602
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:59,060
I still enjoyed it, so I guess I can understand.

2603
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:01,860
Quote on quote, the edgiest boy is very magecore.

2604
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,860
Yeah, that's true.

2605
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:03,860
Yeah, that's true.

2606
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:04,860
Yeah.

2607
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,420
It's kind of mecore too, in a way.

2608
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:09,260
I mean, yeah, no, I really liked Vincent too.

2609
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,540
Nate liked him so much that he caused feelings.

2610
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,220
One of these feelings of superiority, I mean, you know what it's going to be.

2611
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:20,620
Just to use the loaded example, it's like in a couple years or whatever, when someone

2612
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:24,900
plays the Final Fantasy 7 remake, and then I'm talking to them, and they just say, like,

2613
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:29,100
we just met each other, and they're like, oh yeah, I love Final Fantasy 7, and I'm like,

2614
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:33,900
oh my god, and then I go on my spiel about, you know, and then they're like, no, no, no,

2615
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:34,900
stop, stop, idiot.

2616
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:40,140
I'm talking about the remake, and then I'm like, oh god, no, it can't be.

2617
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:45,620
And before it was cool, even in 2019, before the game was even released, I was a huge fan

2618
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:46,620
of the trailers.

2619
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:47,620
Exactly.

2620
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:48,620
Yeah.

2621
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:49,620
Epic.

2622
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:55,340
So look, it's not wrong for them to feel that way, but I absolutely give myself permission

2623
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:59,060
to simply feel superior to them, because I do know more.

2624
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:03,260
But if you want to be a real fan, you need to at least have an opinion about the original

2625
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:04,260
versus the remake.

2626
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:05,260
You probably should.

2627
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,340
I think that's very criteria.

2628
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:11,900
The thing about these sorts of conversations, where somebody shows that they're just a little

2629
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:18,660
baby about some media, and then there's that one guy who does the deep sigh and lets them

2630
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:23,860
know, like, you aren't cool guy, you're not a real fan, that guy as well.

2631
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:27,260
No, I love that guy, that's me.

2632
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,260
You're right.

2633
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,860
Because here's the thing, right, fandom is all about commodification, right?

2634
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:35,500
It's all about, it's all capitalist nightmare, we're playing right into the, we're all playing

2635
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:39,460
right into the big corporation's hand when we have these conversations, oh, you're not

2636
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:42,060
a real fan, because you haven't seen the spin-off, you're not.

2637
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:44,580
Because you have consumed product XYZ.

2638
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:49,100
You're saying you don't own, you don't own all the figurines, but you're not a real

2639
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,100
fan.

2640
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:54,540
Wait, you don't have the Chewbacca figure with, like, the extra bandolier that only

2641
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:58,220
costs like $22.99 extra, you have to custom order it?

2642
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,220
Idiot.

2643
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:02,900
Yeah, so this is what we're doing, we're playing right into Disney's hand, right?

2644
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:09,060
And as, you know, as soon as, first, here's how it's gonna go, first Google buys Facebook,

2645
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:14,220
then Google buys Twitter, then Disney buys Google, then they own us, then they've got

2646
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:18,780
us by the balls, right, then they form the one world government, right, then there's

2647
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:23,540
the tribulation, right, the tribulation, the thousand years of tribulation, then the Antichrist

2648
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:28,140
appears, then Jesus comes back, right, but it's too late, because we've all given up

2649
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:31,140
our faith, right, we don't believe in Jesus anymore, we just believe in-

2650
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:33,460
And they're like, you're not a real fan of the Bible, you don't even know that hell

2651
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,580
isn't real, it was never even in the original text, dude.

2652
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,580
Yeah, exactly.

2653
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:41,420
Wait, you didn't read, wait, you didn't even read Dante's Inferno, you're not a fucking

2654
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:42,420
real fan, alright?

2655
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,420
You didn't, that's fucking fan fiction.

2656
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:44,420
You're not a fucking goddammit.

2657
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:47,920
Goddammit, it's not, yeah, no, you're not, for that example, bad example.

2658
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:52,900
And after all that, endless wars to our heart happens, it's like, under Disney, slime is

2659
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,700
invented, and then everything goes to shit.

2660
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,260
Well, under Jesus, slime is invented.

2661
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:00,580
I just wanna say, like, you know, like how people get keepin', like, get annoyed, it's

2662
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:05,740
like, oh, you've only consumed this media, and it's kinda sad, because like, I find

2663
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:09,660
it really cool that people get interested in the media, and then like, you have something

2664
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:11,140
to talk about with them.

2665
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:16,140
I think the most annoying thing is if they get a big head about like, oh, I watched the

2666
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:21,140
remake of this thing, and then like, they talk down to you as if they know better than

2667
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:23,300
you, I think that's the most annoying thing people do.

2668
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,300
That can be annoying.

2669
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,660
Yeah, but like, in general, I really like it when people get into it, even if it's not,

2670
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:32,260
you know, the OG or only part of the thing, like, I think Never Paint recently started

2671
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:36,900
like, their first Pokemon game ever, and I'm like, yes, you're playing Pokemon, that's

2672
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,900
so cool.

2673
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:42,340
You're experiencing the things, and that's really neat, and I like that, and I'm happy

2674
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:43,340
for them.

2675
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:48,740
Look, I agree, gatekeeping can be a bad thing, but I believe in benevolent gatekeeping in

2676
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:54,700
a big way, which, namely, like, okay, remember in Hunter Hunter, remember in Hunter Hunter,

2677
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:59,060
and they go to save Killua from that house, and there's literally a big gate in the way.

2678
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:04,500
There's a big gate, and in order to go rescue Killua, they had to do a sick shonen montage

2679
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:08,100
to get strong so they could push open the gate to get through.

2680
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,860
This is exactly how I think about, not even like fandom, but like, like the game Sekiro.

2681
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:16,700
So many people got filtered by Sekiro because it was too fucking hard, and they couldn't

2682
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:20,660
summon Solare to save their pansy ass, and they weren't willing to put in the dozens

2683
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:23,860
of hours of work to get good at that fucking game, and good!

2684
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:27,540
They don't deserve to get through because they didn't work for it.

2685
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:31,860
These things should exist so that we have some filtration system, so that we know.

2686
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:39,860
I don't see the connection between skilgating in a video game and fandom of, like, Samurai

2687
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,860
Jack.

2688
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:45,180
Okay, if you're in a Discord server that's about, like, deep-level discussion of, let's

2689
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:51,580
just say, anime, like, you're like a Ukrainian Zagok, or you're like an econ, or a Digibro.

2690
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:53,780
You're one of these people who has deep-level knowledge.

2691
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,780
The three-level knowledge.

2692
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,780
The three-level apocalypse right there.

2693
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:56,780
Yeah, exactly.

2694
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:00,100
These guys, they know shit, alright, they know shit.

2695
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:06,900
Like sure, could a newcomer come in who has barely seen any anime and like engage in discussion?

2696
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,060
Sure, they could do that.

2697
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:12,220
They probably wouldn't have been able to contribute to that kind of conversation.

2698
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:16,380
What they should do is, what I would want that person to do is be like, okay, I can

2699
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:20,940
see the conversation is above my pay grade, I could participate, but really I should

2700
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:25,500
just go and, like, learn some of these examples that are being discussed before, like, you

2701
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:31,260
know, like, annoying people by trying to interject myself into situations where I just am at

2702
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:36,340
operating at a way lower intellectual level of information than, like, the other people

2703
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,340
here.

2704
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,340
That's what I'm saying, which seems like a perfectly reasonable way to look.

2705
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,340
Here's my, well, here's my take, right?

2706
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:47,540
You don't, you do not need, you do not need to have, to be an expert to have an opinion

2707
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:49,020
on something, right?

2708
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:52,620
Like you don't need, you don't need to have seen everything to have an opinion about a

2709
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,660
movie, for example.

2710
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:01,580
But I mean, you should know, you should just know that, like, I mean, you should, you know,

2711
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:05,620
you should just fucking be reasonable about it and be like, okay, well, I only know, I

2712
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:08,180
only know about the things I've seen.

2713
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:11,220
And if there are things that I haven't seen, then I don't know about them, right?

2714
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:14,980
Just keep, keep that guideline in mind and you'll, you'll be okay, dear, dear.

2715
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:22,380
But specifically when it comes to video games, it's a little different where, because the,

2716
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:27,060
the amount of the game you end up playing can differ from person to person.

2717
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:32,060
If you see a movie, most people finish the movie, not everybody like skips a scene or

2718
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:36,460
like starts halfway through and thinks they've seen the movie.

2719
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:40,740
Maybe some people do, but like, they're quickly shot down with bullets.

2720
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:46,100
If somebody plays Sekiro, for example, and they can't get past a certain boss, but they

2721
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:51,540
say they're, they like the game and they try to participate in certain conversations,

2722
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:56,300
it's difficult because on the one hand, they are a fan of the game because they've played

2723
01:56:56,300 --> 01:57:00,860
it, but they aren't a person who has completely completed it like some of the other people.

2724
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:04,340
Okay, but what if they watched the Let's Play and they saw how it ended?

2725
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:06,340
Okay, there's things they can and can say.

2726
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,620
There's a visual feeling of like playing the game is different from Let's Playing.

2727
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:10,180
I think everyone understands that.

2728
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:14,340
The person can say they enjoy the game, they like playing it, they love the lore, they

2729
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:15,460
can say all those things.

2730
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:20,180
What they can't say is that I beat the game if they didn't beat the game and that's perfectly

2731
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,940
fine, a distinction to make.

2732
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:24,420
It's just, you know, depends on what the conversation is.

2733
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:28,780
Well, it just makes it a little more complicated because like, say for example, somebody has

2734
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:35,220
beaten 90% of the game or, and having a conversation with somebody who's just started, like a game

2735
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:43,300
takes a long time to complete, and a movie or an anime, it's like a start and stop.

2736
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,060
You watch the thing from the beginning to the end, and if you haven't done that, then

2737
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:51,140
it's very clear that you're not, you know, you can't participate.

2738
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:55,900
I think it really depends on what the topic of discussion is and what exactly they're

2739
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:56,900
discussing.

2740
01:57:56,900 --> 01:58:00,980
If they're just, you know, talking about the things they liked and liked so far and stuff,

2741
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:07,460
you know, just naming things, sharing experiences, I think both a starter and an expert can find

2742
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:12,460
things to talk about, but, you know, like if they talk about some sort of in-depth lore

2743
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:16,820
or future spoilers or something, or like the feeling of defeating the boss, then, you know,

2744
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:20,340
the newbie wouldn't be able to necessarily relate.

2745
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:23,420
I want to make a new OC, possibly an endless war.

2746
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:24,420
They're called the Gatekeeper.

2747
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:26,900
This is all they do.

2748
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:31,620
They know all the lore, and if you ever reveal that you don't know every single thing about

2749
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:37,780
a mechanic or the lore or a character or anything, you will be sought out and destroyed if you

2750
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,380
reveal this about yourself.

2751
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,380
The mate of the time reaper.

2752
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:45,780
Ooh, that's a good one, too.

2753
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:46,780
Yes.

2754
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,300
Well, Munchie, is there anything else interesting going on at school in your life?

2755
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,020
Because it seems like a fascinating new change.

2756
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:55,020
It is.

2757
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:56,460
I mean, you know, I'm really early in.

2758
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:02,980
There's probably one person who I've really pissed off with the series of, like, haha,

2759
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:05,140
I'm having so much fun.

2760
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:11,180
Ooh, I feel like, oh, wow, some people are going to not make it through the freshman

2761
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:12,180
year.

2762
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:13,180
Haha, I say naively.

2763
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:19,660
Ooh, I am upset that someone didn't watch Office Emerit Jack.

2764
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,820
So I can imagine there's one person really upset about that.

2765
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:25,420
That's really just boiling in their seats or sorry to them.

2766
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,780
They're not going to make it anyway.

2767
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:27,780
Yeah, you know what?

2768
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,780
That's fine.

2769
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:32,860
Anyway, in school, I mean, there's like a lot of things, there's so many things that

2770
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:37,820
have happened over the past couple of weeks, you know, that it's hard to really pick apart

2771
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:38,820
all the things.

2772
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:39,820
I mean, I'm just having a lot of fun.

2773
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,820
I'm really enjoying it.

2774
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:41,820
Are your roommates all right?

2775
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:42,820
How's the roommate situation?

2776
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,060
Well, you see, well, you've seen it.

2777
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,740
I'm in my dorm right now.

2778
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:49,780
I don't know how the walls are.

2779
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:58,100
And I do know, I do know that one of my roommates is possibly listening to this very show right

2780
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,100
now.

2781
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,100
Oh my God.

2782
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:04,380
So, listen, I can't talk about any one of them because I don't know how secure it is.

2783
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,380
Fuck you, David.

2784
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,380
You crazy shit.

2785
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:07,380
No, no, no.

2786
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:08,380
Go back to Scandinavia.

2787
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:19,620
Listen, I can't really speak too much about that, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoy

2788
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:21,340
my dorm.

2789
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:22,340
Well, that's great.

2790
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:23,340
There's no problems there.

2791
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:26,140
But I will refrain from specifics.

2792
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:33,580
I will say that today and for the past couple of days, I have been like just fucking like

2793
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:42,980
in my own eyes slaying, slaying like a queen because I've really gotten a hold of the routine

2794
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:47,100
because, you know, it's somewhat hard to adjust going from, especially like me, like, you

2795
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:53,060
know, living off the chain, you know, you know, fucking sick nasty without having basically

2796
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:56,980
any like actual routine in place.

2797
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:59,980
Obviously, I've talked many times on the show about having like a set in place routine

2798
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:06,620
that I impose upon myself, but how different is it from a self-imposed to like an outside

2799
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:07,620
impose routine?

2800
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,620
I mean, that's crazy.

2801
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:16,740
But anyway, the point is, is that I have a school schedule now, so I've had to like

2802
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:22,540
work around my life around that as opposed to, you know, work my like art around myself.

2803
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:27,540
And so it's been a really, you know, hasn't been like, you know, agonizing, but I finally

2804
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:31,140
now actually just put it away and finally been able, I've woken up at seven for the

2805
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:34,780
past couple of days, like how I want, and I'm just in a routine.

2806
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:38,700
I'm writing my journal way more than I used to, and I'm cooking on myself.

2807
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:39,700
I just, I feel great.

2808
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:40,700
I feel a master of my own demand.

2809
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,220
I'm getting work done as soon as I get it.

2810
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:44,340
And it's just, I earlier today, right?

2811
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:46,100
The reason I'm all jazzed up about this.

2812
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:52,260
Earlier today, I took a long walk to art supply school, art supply store to get stuff for

2813
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,260
my homework.

2814
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:57,180
And just on that, like I just got an idea for something that I want to create, like

2815
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:58,580
an art project I want to make.

2816
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:02,580
And so I just got off of the road and I just stopped in a cafe and I just spent like two

2817
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,060
hours in a cafe.

2818
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:07,740
And then while I was in there, it wasn't like the usual, like, you know, I sit down to write

2819
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,340
and like, oh God, what am I going to do?

2820
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:12,940
Like I have an idea that I kind of want to eke out of my brain, but like it's so ill

2821
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:13,940
to find a way.

2822
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:17,900
It's like, I just have to sit down like make like, oh, the characters of this character

2823
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:18,900
is this.

2824
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:24,420
No, it just so easily transferred from my brain to the page to the point where it's like,

2825
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,020
I have something that I can like just do.

2826
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:32,780
I've never felt like I always feel like no matter how much of the art that I've made

2827
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:37,140
online, no matter how easy it gets, how much of a process I work out, it always feels when

2828
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:41,860
I start a new thing that I'm doing, it always feels like, oh God, there's so much to do.

2829
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:45,900
I have so many things that I have to like, oh, I have to write so much for this project.

2830
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:47,420
I have to do so much for this.

2831
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:48,540
I don't feel that way at all.

2832
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:52,580
I feel, I think it's a large part due to like me being in a new environment and me feeling

2833
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,580
kind of fresh.

2834
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:54,980
I feel spry, guys.

2835
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:57,740
I feel like, I feel like I'm alive again.

2836
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:02,980
I feel like I'm just so brimming with things that I want to do and like it's weird, right?

2837
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:07,020
Because I've had so much time before and now that I have less time to do things that I

2838
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:10,460
want, I'm more, you know, incentivized, or not incentivized, but I'm more inspired to

2839
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:11,460
do it.

2840
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:14,460
Life works out like that, but it's just like, I feel good.

2841
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,620
I feel really creative.

2842
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:19,420
I feel really like, like I'm making things and like I'm not working hard, but it's

2843
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:20,420
stupid.

2844
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:23,660
I feel like I'm working smart and also hard and it's great and I'm alive right now.

2845
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,380
I feel so good.

2846
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:30,860
I like that romantic idea of just sitting at a cafe, like, you know, just doing that

2847
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:36,380
was like, hmm, I'm gonna be like a creative, I'm gonna sit at a cafe and I'm gonna like

2848
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:38,420
write on it in a little book.

2849
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,420
Oh, dude.

2850
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,420
Okay.

2851
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:44,220
Based on what you just said right there, I've actually made a vow.

2852
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:51,340
This is a scary thing for me, but I'm now officially saving up for an iPad.

2853
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:52,340
I've made the decision.

2854
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:58,220
I'm gonna get an iPad because I want, because my laptop is like really terrible and really

2855
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:03,020
bad and like sucks and I need something that I can go around and write with.

2856
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:08,220
So I was writing and as I just said, it worked out great and I got a lot of stuff down on

2857
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:13,540
the page that I think is like really valuable and it was great, but I was just like texting

2858
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:18,700
on my phone basically and it was like kind of a nightmare with that interface and I've

2859
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:21,540
just been teeter on the edge of being an iPad for a while because I really like the pencil

2860
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:24,740
or like the idea of I can just like go out on the go and I can just draw whatever I want

2861
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:25,740
to.

2862
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:30,860
So yeah, it was romantic hippo, but it was offset by the fact that it was on a, I'm just

2863
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:34,460
like on my fucking phone and it was really annoying and stupid and I looked really lame

2864
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,580
and dumb.

2865
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:38,020
iPads are pretty sick.

2866
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,220
iPads are dope, man.

2867
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:40,220
I like them.

2868
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,220
I like them a lot.

2869
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:42,220
There's so many apps.

2870
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:43,220
The apps, man.

2871
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:44,220
Gotta get that procreate going.

2872
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:45,220
That's like the old standard.

2873
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:46,580
Munchie, you mentioned something in there.

2874
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:48,260
I just had to touch on briefly.

2875
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,740
You said that you've been cooking.

2876
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,740
That's great.

2877
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:51,980
Okay, but forget you.

2878
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:56,860
Let's talk about me, which is that, okay, so recently, me and Michelle have gotten our

2879
02:04:56,860 --> 02:04:59,700
hands on some of these Amazon meal kits.

2880
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:03,420
Oh God, not this shit again.

2881
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:05,300
You must have horse shit.

2882
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,220
Don't do Hello Fresh.

2883
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:09,740
Don't do these prepared meal kits like they're bad.

2884
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:10,740
It just keeps coming back.

2885
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:11,740
You think you slayed it?

2886
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,740
You think you slayed the Hydra.

2887
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:13,740
You don't want to die.

2888
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:16,540
You think you slayed the Hydra, but two heads grow back.

2889
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:21,180
Ben, I'm under no, I'm under no illusion, but let me tell you, friend.

2890
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:26,500
Let me tell you, when I was chowing down on my 30 minute prepared Amazon meal kit seared

2891
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:32,140
salmon with fennel and pea risotto, it was, I'm not lying, I'm not lying, making this

2892
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:37,720
meal as exactly instructed with all the ingredients prepared right there was so easy to make.

2893
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:41,580
This was one of the most delicious meals I've had my entire life.

2894
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,580
These Amazon meal kits.

2895
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:47,860
This is not an exaggeration, I'm 100% serious, and you know what, I'm sure a large part of

2896
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:51,620
it is the satisfaction of having it cooked at home.

2897
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:52,620
It's incredible.

2898
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:53,620
I'm disgusted with you right now.

2899
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:54,620
I'm so fucking disgusted.

2900
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:59,220
I made this fucking, I made this amazing couscous Amazon meal kit deal.

2901
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:01,140
I don't know what fucking couscous is.

2902
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,140
You're so spineless.

2903
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:03,140
I just made it according to the meal kit.

2904
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:04,780
You're such a spineless fucking coward, Nate.

2905
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,780
You're so fucking terrible.

2906
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:06,780
Why are you arguing again?

2907
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:07,780
You used to be on his side.

2908
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,780
Easy to make.

2909
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:09,780
No, no.

2910
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,780
What?

2911
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:16,300
Okay, because Nate, Nate used to always, you know, flip flop between, oh yeah, ha ha,

2912
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:20,500
fucking hello fresh, but then also, oh, but I see the appeal, he would flip flop between

2913
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,820
them, he would be like, you know, a reasonable person, fuck you.

2914
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:27,460
And so now he goes from, you know, sort of downplaying hello fresh, now going with evil

2915
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:30,140
hello fresh, which is Amazon meal kits.

2916
02:06:30,140 --> 02:06:33,860
It just is hello fresh, but now it's owned by Amazon and they're like any evil version.

2917
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,940
I mean, I just say that, okay, we, we got them for free.

2918
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:38,580
These were, these were literally free.

2919
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:43,180
So like we didn't pay for them, so that's the big reason why we got them.

2920
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:48,140
I forget if it was hello fresh or blue apron, but I got a, a free, I got like a free like

2921
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:50,540
week's worth of it, which one time, which is why I know.

2922
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:51,540
Yeah, you might as well.

2923
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:52,540
There's no, yeah.

2924
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:53,540
Sure, sure, sure.

2925
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:54,540
That's fine.

2926
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,540
That's cool at all.

2927
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:56,540
Okay.

2928
02:06:56,540 --> 02:07:00,740
If you, if you didn't roll with me from the start, you don't need to roll with me now.

2929
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:04,060
I want to quickly talk about food since we're talking about food.

2930
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:05,060
Wait, mate.

2931
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:06,060
Let me finish my point.

2932
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:07,060
Then you can talk about food.

2933
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:13,140
It's just that, well, this is, why would I ever want to not do this when it's, it's

2934
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,300
so easy.

2935
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:15,940
It's so delicious.

2936
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:16,940
It's, I don't know.

2937
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:18,180
The calorie counts are right there.

2938
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,180
They're reasonably healthy.

2939
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:23,100
Because you can literally do it yourself for less money.

2940
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:24,900
You can do the same exact thing.

2941
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:31,180
I don't know how to put together, by salmon, by couscous, by fucking, any recipe that fucking

2942
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:35,700
cares and shit, any recipe that fucking Garfield eats or whatever fucking service this is when

2943
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:40,220
send you in the mail, you can just, you can figure it, you can Google it.

2944
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:42,020
Oh, you're right.

2945
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:44,980
Look, guys, just entertain this for a second, Ben.

2946
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:48,820
Have you ever thought for a second that some of the meals that are being, look, by, you

2947
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:53,100
buy the box, it has the exact meal that you're going to get and exact instructions that you

2948
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:55,820
will get, that whatever you're going to do.

2949
02:07:55,820 --> 02:08:01,460
We have made through these, food that I did not envision myself being able to easily make

2950
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:02,460
at home.

2951
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:05,980
I've now learned that it is easy to make, but it can be done.

2952
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:13,540
You know, fine, I just, I'm just saying, I'm just saying that there are ways to expand

2953
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:20,180
your culinary horizons that does not involve prostrating yourself on the capitalist altar

2954
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:23,860
of fucking Jeff Bezos, his offshore bank accounts, or whatever the fuck.

2955
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:25,660
What, are you going to stop using Amazon, Ben?

2956
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:27,660
Are you going to stop ordering from Amazon?

2957
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:29,700
It's not that I think you shouldn't use Amazon.

2958
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:34,420
It's that, it's that you could, it's just that you could do the exact same thing without

2959
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:36,740
using Amazon.

2960
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,980
That's a, well, look, it's fine, look, it's fine.

2961
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:42,060
I don't want to overstate, I don't want to overstate how much of a crime I think this

2962
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:48,180
is, but I just like, you don't need this fucking service to do this for you.

2963
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:53,300
I have more faith in you than that.

2964
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:57,220
This is kind of the exact same thing we were just talking about with like the gatekeeping

2965
02:08:57,220 --> 02:09:04,420
and like the plague who doesn't, you know, he, he's still like, you are to cooking as

2966
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:08,820
somebody who hasn't beaten a single boss in Sekiro is to you.

2967
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:09,820
Who?

2968
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:10,820
Who's who in this analogy?

2969
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:11,820
Huh?

2970
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:12,820
It's clearly me.

2971
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:13,820
I mean, I'm the, I'm the new guy.

2972
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:14,820
I'm the scrub.

2973
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:15,820
Or he's the gatekeeper.

2974
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,820
No.

2975
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:17,820
No.

2976
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:19,500
I thought this would be very simple.

2977
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:24,420
The whole thing with cooking is that you're doing like an easy loser baby stupid thing

2978
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:27,860
and everyone else around you is, is like laughing at you.

2979
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,660
Like they're doing the deep side.

2980
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,060
You're such a fake food fan.

2981
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:32,740
I can't believe you would do this.

2982
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,740
Okay.

2983
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:34,740
Yeah.

2984
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:35,740
Kind of a little bit.

2985
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:40,260
I just, like, if you put the hard work in, like in Sekiro, if you put the hard work in,

2986
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:45,620
you can make these, these things like, like easily over time, you will gain skills.

2987
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:50,060
You will gain like a library of ingredients that you know work well together and you can

2988
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:51,060
make stuff up.

2989
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:52,060
Yeah.

2990
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:55,500
You know, in Sekiro, in Sekiro actually, you can get your hands on rice through after

2991
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,740
a while, there's a lady gives you rice, but you eat it raw.

2992
02:09:57,740 --> 02:09:59,820
Cannot, the character eats it raw.

2993
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:04,660
It's a life hack, like advanced, like one of the secret ending strats where like Kuro,

2994
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:07,900
your little Lord guy, he actually is like, you've been eating it raw.

2995
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:09,380
Let me, let me like cook it for you.

2996
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:11,260
And then he makes delicious rice balls.

2997
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:16,260
So he does up his cooking game, Cannotically in Sekiro, when you dive deep and do some

2998
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:18,020
of the like harder to access endings.

2999
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:19,020
It's a metaphor.

3000
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,020
How fascinating.

3001
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:23,580
Forget, forget, forget and good.

3002
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,580
And I agree.

3003
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:25,580
Get, but I'm not good.

3004
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,580
Okay.

3005
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:27,580
Good, good.

3006
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:28,580
Wait, okay.

3007
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:29,580
You know what?

3008
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,580
I shouldn't be, you know what?

3009
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,460
The fact, I'm, I'm reassured by the fact that you got it for free.

3010
02:10:32,460 --> 02:10:33,460
This makes me feel.

3011
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:34,460
It was free.

3012
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,460
This makes me feel so much better about the whole thing.

3013
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:36,460
Okay.

3014
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:37,460
Okay.

3015
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:41,220
Listen, we've had the final Hello Fresh conversation like 12 times now on this show.

3016
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:46,060
I'll say what I've said a thousand times before, you know, you don't need it, but it's just

3017
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:48,700
convenient and convenience may matter to you.

3018
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:52,980
You know, if you, if you can spare it, you know, convenience, it's nice and all, but

3019
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:53,980
you know, you don't need it.

3020
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:54,980
Yeah.

3021
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:58,740
But the satisfaction of being like a chef who knows how to do it is way better.

3022
02:10:58,740 --> 02:10:59,740
Is way better than summoning in.

3023
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:00,740
That's too big.

3024
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:01,740
I need dinner tonight.

3025
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,740
It's way better than summoning.

3026
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:08,900
I guess all I would say, I guess all I would say is if, if you're, if you're like, okay,

3027
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,260
I don't know how to cook.

3028
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:14,900
Oh, but like, you know, something like Hello Fresh or Amazon eats or Garfield eats or whatever

3029
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:15,900
the fuck.

3030
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:21,340
If they, they, you know, through, through this, I can, I can expand my horizon and learn how

3031
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:22,340
to do it.

3032
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:25,060
I would say cool, but guess what?

3033
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:26,900
You don't need that.

3034
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:31,060
You can, you can, you can, you can, you can learn on your own.

3035
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:33,820
You can learn, you can just fucking Google the recipe and make it.

3036
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:35,340
I do it sometimes.

3037
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,340
It's pretty all right.

3038
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:37,340
All right.

3039
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:41,780
I'm going to make a value judgment right now, but Nate, I don't think that you will ever

3040
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:44,300
Google search how to make a specific type of food.

3041
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:48,300
I don't think you'll ever do that in your life and like try to like expand your horizons

3042
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,300
that way.

3043
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:50,300
Am I wrong?

3044
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:51,300
Okay.

3045
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,300
Yeah.

3046
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,300
Life's a long time.

3047
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:54,300
We'll see.

3048
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:55,300
We'll see.

3049
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:57,020
So I think this is an extremely unlikely scenario.

3050
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:58,020
Well, that's dumb.

3051
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:02,300
If you'll satisfied me, if you'll gave me a hundred percent of my nutritional value and

3052
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:05,180
I had no problems that I could just drink it, I would just do that.

3053
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:06,980
I don't care.

3054
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:10,020
It's not important to me, but these meals, they are pretty great.

3055
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:11,780
They are delicious and they're better than you.

3056
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:13,780
So I'm sure they're better than you.

3057
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:15,780
Nothing's better than you.

3058
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:16,780
They don't blast.

3059
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:22,780
This is Nate's glowing review of Amazon eats better than you.

3060
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:23,860
But I love you.

3061
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:24,860
He was great.

3062
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:25,860
That's a high recommendation.

3063
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:28,300
I got, I ordered the chocolate, you'll in the bottles.

3064
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:29,300
It was pretty good.

3065
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,300
It was pretty good.

3066
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:31,300
Oh yeah.

3067
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:32,300
See, see, yeah.

3068
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:35,700
The biggest problem is that they're not filling and I find myself pretty hungry before too

3069
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:36,700
long after.

3070
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,860
The biggest problem is that they're too fucking expensive.

3071
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:40,860
There's that too.

3072
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:43,260
They're like three to four dollars or something when you have to eat.

3073
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,260
It's unacceptably expensive.

3074
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:45,260
I have a solution.

3075
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:46,500
Powder is a much better deal.

3076
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:47,500
I have a solution.

3077
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:48,980
I have a solution, Nate.

3078
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:54,580
This is like in sort of in relation to what I wanted earlier to say.

3079
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:59,300
So I went out today to the shop and I bought like a bunch of ingredients, like a lot of

3080
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,380
like vegetables and whatnot.

3081
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:06,860
I made soup and it was like with a little flavor, soup cubes or whatever.

3082
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:08,660
I threw a bunch of stuff in.

3083
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:10,940
I didn't know who was going to taste good or not.

3084
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:18,660
And just like the cherry on top, I put everything into a blender and I put this in a blender

3085
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:22,900
because I was too lazy to like chop everything into small bits.

3086
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:23,900
Hold on.

3087
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:24,900
Hold the fucking phone.

3088
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:25,900
Wait, wait, wait.

3089
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:26,900
Hold the fucking phone.

3090
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,900
Wait.

3091
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:29,900
How was it?

3092
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,900
That is not what a blender is for.

3093
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:32,900
Wait, wait, wait.

3094
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:33,900
Okay.

3095
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:37,580
Are you saying that you put all the ingredients into a blender, blended it in the blender

3096
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:39,660
and then put it in a pot and cooked it?

3097
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,660
No, no, no.

3098
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:41,660
I cooked it first.

3099
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:46,220
Like I chopped it into like reasonable cubes.

3100
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:48,620
So did it just end up as like a soup smoothie?

3101
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:49,620
Yes.

3102
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,620
Jesus Christ.

3103
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:51,620
Was it good?

3104
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,620
Was it good?

3105
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:53,620
It was perfect.

3106
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:54,620
It was great.

3107
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:55,620
It was great.

3108
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:56,620
You know what I'm saying.

3109
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:58,740
It was like a very like normal.

3110
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:01,380
This would strike me as just like normal.

3111
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:03,380
This doesn't seem weird or bad at all.

3112
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:06,340
This is like tired of having to chew every bite of food.

3113
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:07,340
We've got the solution.

3114
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:11,420
This is not normal, but I don't think it sounds too bad because like when you cook it all

3115
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:14,340
in a soup, it all kind of like the flavors all kind of run together.

3116
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:15,340
Yeah.

3117
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:18,780
So I can sort of imagine you just kind of blend it and it just becomes like a smooth puree

3118
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:20,780
that has that soup flavor.

3119
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:21,780
Yeah, basically.

3120
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,820
And it's like, it feels a lot more filling.

3121
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,740
It depends on how much water you put.

3122
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:28,140
It might be like thicker or thinner.

3123
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:29,540
What did you put in it?

3124
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:31,620
I want to imagine this experience.

3125
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,620
Okay.

3126
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:37,900
It was slightly experimental, so I wasn't sure if it was going to turn out great or not.

3127
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:38,900
No kidding.

3128
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:39,900
Okay.

3129
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:46,500
So a bit of, I think like two small red peppers, which didn't turn out that spicy this time

3130
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:51,780
because I previously had made a similar soup, but that I was following a recipe, but this

3131
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:55,100
time I was just like, just doing my own thing.

3132
02:14:55,100 --> 02:15:01,380
So like two red peppers, a handful of like tiny bell peppers, like these orange ones,

3133
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:02,380
like baby bell peppers or something.

3134
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:03,380
Okay.

3135
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:04,380
So just a whole lot of peppers so far.

3136
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:05,380
Just peppers too.

3137
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,380
Oh, the red peppers.

3138
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:07,380
Okay.

3139
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:08,380
Okay.

3140
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:11,020
The red peppers are meant to be spicy, but bell peppers are kind of sweet.

3141
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,020
Yeah.

3142
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:18,580
And then I got like a pack of carrots, diced carrots, and something else, something yellow,

3143
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:21,460
not yams, something I don't remember what they're called.

3144
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,460
A squash maybe?

3145
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:23,460
Some kind of squash.

3146
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,460
Not squash.

3147
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:27,220
It was a very short word.

3148
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,220
It doesn't matter.

3149
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:29,220
It's mostly carrots.

3150
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:30,220
Yeah, we got it.

3151
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:31,220
Yeah.

3152
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:32,220
Yeah.

3153
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:34,540
Then some onions, this time red onions.

3154
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:35,540
Okay.

3155
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:40,580
I got some chives and what else did I put?

3156
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:44,300
Like two different flavor cubes, one, like, I don't remember what they're called, like

3157
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:45,300
stock or something.

3158
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,300
Bullion.

3159
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,300
Right?

3160
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,300
Yeah.

3161
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,300
Yeah.

3162
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:50,300
Yeah.

3163
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:53,100
So like one is vegetable flavor, the other is mushroom flavor because I freaking love

3164
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:54,100
mushrooms.

3165
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:55,100
Bullion cube.

3166
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:56,100
Ah.

3167
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:57,100
Ah.

3168
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,100
What?

3169
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:59,100
What?

3170
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:00,100
Bullion?

3171
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,100
I don't like this.

3172
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,100
What?

3173
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:03,100
What?

3174
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:04,100
I don't like this.

3175
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:05,100
What are you talking about?

3176
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,100
What are you talking about?

3177
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:07,100
Yeah.

3178
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:08,100
Yeah.

3179
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:09,100
Bullion cubes.

3180
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:10,100
Like all soups do that.

3181
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,100
Otherwise, they're super heck of a blend.

3182
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,100
Yeah.

3183
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,100
Curry too uses like curry stuff.

3184
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,100
Okay.

3185
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:22,100
So you put bullion cubes, peppers, something yellow, carrots, and red onions in a pot, boiled

3186
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:27,100
it, and chives, boiled it for a while, and then you put it in a blender, blend it.

3187
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:35,100
There's a little bit of, what's it called, a little bit of butter, a little bit of oil.

3188
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:36,100
Yeah.

3189
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:40,500
Then like, yeah, then I basically cooked it, a little bit of salt, actually a lot of

3190
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,500
bit of salt.

3191
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:42,500
Yeah.

3192
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,500
Yeah.

3193
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:46,660
I cooked all of it nice and cooked, and then I chucked it in the blender.

3194
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:47,660
This is the kind of thing.

3195
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:49,300
I don't, I condone this.

3196
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:57,300
This is the kind of thing that my friends would say that I do, but actually, no, even

3197
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:58,300
I'm not.

3198
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,300
It's disgusting.

3199
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:02,020
That's a totally Bencore move.

3200
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:05,300
It's just like cook it all in a pot and then blend it and drink it.

3201
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:06,300
I like it.

3202
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:07,300
I think that's cool.

3203
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:09,740
I actually think that's really cool.

3204
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:11,300
Isn't it just baby food?

3205
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,300
Yeah.

3206
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,300
Yes.

3207
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:14,300
It is.

3208
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:15,300
Yeah.

3209
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:16,300
It is.

3210
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,300
It could be.

3211
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:18,300
Exactly.

3212
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:23,300
That's, if you had a baby and you wanted to feed it some food.

3213
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:28,100
To be quite honest, I sort of had the idea because during the summer, I went to visit

3214
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:34,300
my grandma and she was unwell, and I had to cook food for her like soups and stuff, but

3215
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,300
she couldn't chew at that time, so I had to blend it in for her.

3216
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:39,580
And it tasted fucking amazing, you know?

3217
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:40,580
So I just remember.

3218
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:41,580
I believe it.

3219
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:42,580
I believe it's good.

3220
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:45,260
This reminds me of the time I was trying to make mashed cauliflower, which if you do

3221
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:50,060
it right can be very similar to mashed potatoes in flavor and consistency.

3222
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:54,260
But I tried to do, I didn't have a food processor, so I put it in a blender and I blended it

3223
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:59,780
way too much and it reduced itself so much that it became like a slime.

3224
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:07,740
It became a pure, smooth, textureless cauliflower slime and it was absolutely disgusting.

3225
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:09,860
You made slime.

3226
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:13,740
You know, I would think that like, oh, well, sure, it doesn't have, it's not a, it's a

3227
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:16,660
slime now, but it would still have that good cauliflower flavor.

3228
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,660
No.

3229
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:24,100
The change in texture made it totally disgusting and inedible, and I had to, even I wouldn't

3230
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:25,100
eat it, is what I'm saying.

3231
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:31,980
And just for future reference, if anyone tries to make what I just made, go easy on the carrots,

3232
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:36,940
because I ate too much carrots and those other stuff, whatever they were, it kind of killed

3233
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:41,300
the spiciness of the peppers, which I was a little disappointed in, I was hoping for

3234
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:42,300
a tiny kick.

3235
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:45,860
I don't particularly like spicy things, but the last time I made something like that,

3236
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:50,740
I kind of lifed a little bit of spiciness to it, but this time it got absolutely murdered

3237
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:51,740
by cats.

3238
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:52,740
Murdered.

3239
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:56,700
Okay, this chapter of PCP Kitchen is officially closed.

3240
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:58,740
I think we're ready to move on.

3241
02:18:58,740 --> 02:18:59,740
Let's move on.

3242
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:05,380
Wait, Ben, speaking of Ben Saint things, I have, I finally understand what it's like

3243
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:06,380
to be you, Ben.

3244
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:07,380
Oh no.

3245
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:11,540
And that's to do things that are personally, that are perfectly reasonable and everyone

3246
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,420
thinks that it's weird or that it's bad.

3247
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:14,420
That's my life.

3248
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:15,420
That's my life.

3249
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:17,100
I'm just doing the most logical thing.

3250
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:21,900
I'm just following my perfectly reasonable ideas, their logical conclusions, and everyone's

3251
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:24,860
giving me the side I like, what the fuck, bro?

3252
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:25,860
Yeah.

3253
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:26,860
Yeah.

3254
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:27,860
Such as.

3255
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,860
Such as.

3256
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:32,900
I, so, okay, so I get to college, right, and you know, there's nothing in here anywhere,

3257
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:36,260
and I have to decide what furniture I want, and I think, okay, I want no furniture, and

3258
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:37,260
I want nothing on my walls.

3259
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:39,940
I don't want to have anything in my room, and that's fine.

3260
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:44,220
And then, and then I get to the point where, you know, I need, like, you know, I need pillows

3261
02:19:44,220 --> 02:19:52,980
and blankets and stuff, and I make the apparently huge, like, social faux pas of not getting

3262
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:55,380
sheets for my bed.

3263
02:19:55,380 --> 02:20:01,060
So I just have a pillow and a blanket on my bed, and I have no sheets, and everyone's

3264
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:03,780
just like fucking going crazy.

3265
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:07,940
All my roommates are like, oh my God, what, you don't have sheets on?

3266
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:11,020
People have come into my room like, oh, you're the no sheets guy.

3267
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:12,860
People like, that's the thing that she'll know about me.

3268
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:13,860
You know what?

3269
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:14,860
You know what?

3270
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:17,620
I'm gonna, I'm gonna agree with that, because I just think it would be really uncomfortable

3271
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,620
to sleep on a bed with no sheets.

3272
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:19,620
It's not, though.

3273
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:20,620
I don't think it is.

3274
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:21,620
I wouldn't like it.

3275
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:22,620
Munchy.

3276
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:23,620
Well, okay, whatever, but that's not the point.

3277
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:26,340
The point is that why are people going insane over this?

3278
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:30,820
I was in an elevator, and someone was like, ooh, you don't sleep with, oh, you're the

3279
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:32,540
person who doesn't sleep with sheets on.

3280
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:35,740
Someone literally identified me as a person who doesn't have sheets on their bed because

3281
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:36,740
it's a big fucking secret.

3282
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:38,740
You would think you would be the pizza guy.

3283
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:39,740
Yeah, no.

3284
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:40,740
Okay, no, Munchy.

3285
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:41,740
There's a reason.

3286
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:42,740
The no sheets guy.

3287
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:43,740
Mr. No Sheets.

3288
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:44,740
Okay.

3289
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:49,660
If I'm understanding correctly what the sheets are in this situation, there's a reason why

3290
02:20:49,660 --> 02:20:54,900
sheets are put on blankets and pillows and stuff, and it's something to do a little bit

3291
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:58,500
with hygiene, and I think that's why people are kind of weirded out by you.

3292
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:01,100
Yeah, you're gonna have a smelly ass bed, Munchy, if you don't use sheets.

3293
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,500
You're gonna be a smelly guy.

3294
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:03,500
You don't want that.

3295
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:07,300
You know, you use sheets, you can wash them, but how are you gonna wash a mattress?

3296
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,300
Okay, I mean.

3297
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:10,300
That's the idea.

3298
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:11,300
That's the point, yep.

3299
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:14,300
That doesn't, that has, that you've phased me not even one night.

3300
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:17,700
You used to when you sleep, Munchy, and if you have sheets, you can wash the sheets,

3301
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:21,300
but if it goes straight to the mattress, you'll just kind of have a stanky ass mattress forever.

3302
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:25,300
I wrapped, I'm wrapped up in a blanket, and I have my pillow, which is like my face sweats,

3303
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,300
and I get a lot of pillow.

3304
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:30,300
What about when it's too, what about when it's too hot, what about when it's too hot for

3305
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,300
a blanket?

3306
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:34,100
I mean, like, it's ultimately up to you, Munchy.

3307
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:37,100
I'm just explaining why people are so shocked about it.

3308
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:40,100
Yes, they think it's a hygiene violation, Munchy.

3309
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:42,100
This is what they think of when they see you now.

3310
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:49,100
I think that the idea that people are referring to you as the no sheets guy is why it's crazy.

3311
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,100
Like, I can understand the concerns.

3312
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:54,100
I just don't see why this would be like a big deal.

3313
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:59,100
Like word, word really gets around about this one guy who doesn't have sheets on his bed.

3314
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:03,700
Not a shame that Munchy was trying to keep his power level hidden, but unfortunately he's

3315
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:08,700
now going in the opposite direction, becoming infamous instead of legendary.

3316
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:13,700
I can't believe that you guys are siding with the people who call me no sheets guy.

3317
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:15,700
I can't believe this is the thing.

3318
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:20,500
I literally started this moment when I heard people saying, you know, me and your boys,

3319
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:24,500
your roommates got together and we founded the organization of Munchy No Sheets.

3320
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:25,500
She was like, I just wear sheets on his bed.

3321
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:26,500
Yeah, it was disgusting.

3322
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:28,700
I wanted to kill myself and you when I heard it.

3323
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:33,300
I mean, I'm happy to announce, I guess, to all you fucking cultural, like, vultures

3324
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,600
out there that I've caved and gotten sheets now.

3325
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:36,600
So now I have sheets.

3326
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:38,600
Oh, now you've broken your will.

3327
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:42,400
I was going to say you should get a t-shirt printed like I'm the no sheet, like no sheets

3328
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:43,400
for me.

3329
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:45,400
Ask me about my no sheet.

3330
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:49,400
You know, you know, you know, no fat, this is no sheets.

3331
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:50,400
Hashtag no sheets.

3332
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:52,400
You could just not use the trend.

3333
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:54,400
Yeah, the no sheet gang.

3334
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:57,400
Maybe we've all been bamboozled, you know, I don't know.

3335
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:03,900
So here's the thinking is just that I don't like, I didn't want to have this thing like

3336
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:08,300
I've always hated all the bedwear that that, you know, is accompanied with beds.

3337
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:11,500
I hate the fact there's like a billion sheets and there's like different names for all of

3338
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,500
them.

3339
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:15,100
And there's like, all I all I want to think about is my pillow, my blanket.

3340
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:18,000
And I don't like the fact that I have to like rustle through a bunch of like sheets like

3341
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,300
get through to like the real sheet to get like, you know, all coaxed up in my cocoon

3342
02:23:22,300 --> 02:23:23,300
that is my bed.

3343
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:25,300
I don't have to deal with all the complexities of that.

3344
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:26,300
I don't.

3345
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:29,300
I just want to have a very simple bed, but I guess that's just too much.

3346
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:31,600
I can sort of relate with my sheet.

3347
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:36,100
Like I hate the bothering with sheets, but I'll never stop bothering with sheets because

3348
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:37,500
I know how smelly they can get.

3349
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:42,200
And I know the feeling of fresh sheets and like how nicely smell and how relaxed and

3350
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:47,000
how relaxed I feel after I put on some fresh sheets and I just like, yes, I will sleep

3351
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
well tonight.

3352
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I'm going.

3353
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Okay.

3354
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I don't even.

3355
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Okay.

3356
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I completely don't buy any of this.

3357
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I'm going to like, okay.

3358
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I'm going to wait.

3359
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:56,500
I'm going to wait a year.

3360
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:02,500
I'm like paying people money to smell my bed because I do not believe that they will have

3361
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,500
any noticeable smell whatsoever.

3362
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:05,500
I don't believe it.

3363
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:06,500
You don't have the courage.

3364
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:08,500
You don't have the stones to pull off a maneuver like that.

3365
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:11,500
I mean, it doesn't matter because you're sleeping on a dorm bed, so you're just going to leave

3366
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,500
it for the sucker who's going to take it next year.

3367
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:16,500
So it's not like you're going to have to live with the consequences.

3368
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:22,500
The potential fear, the potential issue you have is your roommates finding your bed smelly

3369
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:24,500
and just making their life worse.

3370
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:25,500
That's the risk.

3371
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,500
I don't know if that's going to happen, but that's the thing to be avoided.

3372
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:29,500
Wait.

3373
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:30,500
Did the bed.

3374
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:31,500
So I don't know.

3375
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,500
Was there a bed there to begin with?

3376
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:33,500
Did it have a sheet?

3377
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:34,500
Yeah.

3378
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:35,500
No, it didn't.

3379
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:36,500
Okay.

3380
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:39,500
So it was just a mattress on a frame.

3381
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:40,500
Yeah.

3382
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:41,500
Yeah.

3383
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:45,500
And I had to go out and I had to buy everything myself and you know, I decided, okay, you

3384
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:46,500
know what?

3385
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:47,500
I don't want to spend the money.

3386
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:48,500
I don't really need a sheet.

3387
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:49,500
I don't really want one.

3388
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:51,000
You know, I don't see the need for it.

3389
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I still don't.

3390
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,500
And so I didn't get one.

3391
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:55,500
But no, but now I'm a pariah.

3392
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:57,500
Now I'm the fucking Jesus Christ, too.

3393
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:59,500
A fucking boss who hasn't used it.

3394
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,500
And everyone in the city, like I'm walking down the street and people are like, like,

3395
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:04,500
he's chattering and like chugging themselves.

3396
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,500
Oh, did you see that guy?

3397
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:06,500
That guy's the one without the bed sheet.

3398
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:09,500
Well, they're chucking stones at you and raining hellfire down on you.

3399
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:13,500
Just tell them I don't need sheets because I am the sheet, man.

3400
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:15,500
That's my motto in life.

3401
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,500
There you go.

3402
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:20,500
And when I try and pick up girls and be like, hey, babe, why don't you come into my sheets

3403
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:22,500
and they're like, you don't have any.

3404
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,500
This game was an expression.

3405
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:26,500
Yeah, exactly.

3406
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,500
Let's go on a voicemail.

3407
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:29,500
Yeah.

3408
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:30,500
Let's do it.

3409
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:31,500
It's time.

3410
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:32,500
All right.

3411
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:33,500
We got a voicemail here.

3412
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,500
Speakpipe people link in the description down below.

3413
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:37,500
It's like speakpipe.com slash PCP.

3414
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:42,500
I don't know what it is, but there's a link down below and leave us voicemails such as

3415
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:44,500
the one we're about to hear.

3416
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:48,500
This one is from a well researched thesis.

3417
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:49,500
Don't at me.

3418
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:50,500
Okay.

3419
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,500
Go.

3420
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:55,500
So the first human core thing is to send a two part voicemail because you think you're

3421
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,500
riddle my ass Batman.

3422
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:03,500
So confident about what human core is without even knowing what human core is to begin with.

3423
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:07,500
And then you say some dumb shit about bathrooms called out.

3424
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,500
All right.

3425
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:14,500
So now that I'm in a voice grail, I'd like to murder my spot to let voices Mozilla Fennekin

3426
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:16,500
out of the voice jail.

3427
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,500
He doesn't deserve to be there.

3428
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:20,500
What?

3429
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:21,500
You're presumptuous.

3430
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:23,500
You fucking you think you're in the voice shell.

3431
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:24,500
Why would you be there?

3432
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:25,500
Wait, who?

3433
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:26,500
Who sent this?

3434
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:30,500
A well researched thesis was their only name.

3435
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:31,500
I don't know.

3436
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:39,500
Maybe it's Mozilla under someone else who apparently we put into the grail and now they want to

3437
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:44,500
I think you're saying that this message was so good they expect to have been put into the

3438
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:47,500
grail as a result of the quality of this very message.

3439
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:49,500
That's a grave miscalculation.

3440
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:52,500
It's a really funny joke because this guy's going to jail.

3441
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:54,500
This guy was good enough for the voice grail.

3442
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,500
It's a really funny joke.

3443
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,500
This guy needs to go to voice jail for his presumption.

3444
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:59,500
Yeah, this guy's going to voice jail.

3445
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:00,500
Absolutely.

3446
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:01,500
I like hate this person.

3447
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:07,500
You're so like cocksure of this message getting in the voice grail.

3448
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,500
I agree.

3449
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:09,500
Unforgivable.

3450
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:10,500
Are you joking me?

3451
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:11,500
It's unforgivable.

3452
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:12,500
Yeah.

3453
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:13,500
Well there you go buddy.

3454
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:14,500
You're in jail for what?

3455
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:15,500
Wait.

3456
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:16,500
What is this?

3457
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,500
I'm getting an update.

3458
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:21,500
There's another message coming in.

3459
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:22,500
I agree.

3460
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:25,500
It's definitely a trap, but whatever.

3461
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:27,000
There's another message coming in.

3462
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
What is this?

3463
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,500
A part two well researched thesis.

3464
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,500
Okay.

3465
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:31,500
What?

3466
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:32,500
Go.

3467
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:33,500
I'm so sorry.

3468
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,500
Please let me out of the voice jail.

3469
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:39,500
I smell like peace and calm here.

3470
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:41,500
This is the worst.

3471
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:43,500
I'm so fed again.

3472
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:47,500
Oh, fuck you.

3473
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:48,500
That's what you get.

3474
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:49,500
That's what you get for trying to help somebody.

3475
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:53,500
He plays like a fiddle and allowed us to destroy him.

3476
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:57,500
He tricked us into making his life worse.

3477
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:59,500
He's in shackles.

3478
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:00,500
He's emaciated.

3479
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:03,500
He's a skeleton hanging from the castle wall.

3480
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:06,500
He's all according to plan.

3481
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:07,500
Wait a minute.

3482
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:08,500
Okay.

3483
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:14,500
What he may have actually meant by that was like, he did say like, I want to like give

3484
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:17,500
up my spot for Mozilla Fennekin to get out.

3485
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:22,500
So maybe what he's saying is I'm in grails, but I'm going to give this up and go to jail

3486
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:24,500
to release Mozilla Fennekin.

3487
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,500
Well, that didn't happen.

3488
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:27,500
That's not even how the system works.

3489
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:31,500
You just leave the grail to get someone out of jail.

3490
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:35,500
I think if you get the grail, you can.

3491
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:37,500
It's like matter and antimatter, right?

3492
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:41,500
You can add decay grail and it just becomes nothing.

3493
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:42,500
You're both back to being poor.

3494
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:47,500
I want to place a Mozilla Fennekin and well research thesis in the same room, you know,

3495
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:51,500
hanging them up by chains on the wall and give the key to both of their things.

3496
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,500
You just place in the middle between them and see who gets to it first.

3497
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:55,500
That's a good idea.

3498
02:28:55,500 --> 02:28:58,500
Let's see how loyalty serves them in that situation.

3499
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:04,500
And then the key out leads into like a bottomless pit and then they fall.

3500
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:05,500
And then they fall.

3501
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:06,500
And then they fall.

3502
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,500
And then they fall.

3503
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:08,500
And then they fall.

3504
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:12,500
So at this point, hippos communication screwed up.

3505
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:15,500
It was unsupportable by editing.

3506
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:20,500
Let's continue with the program.

3507
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:28,500
Next one is from Di-N word trapped in commie hell, but it's spelled E-N-W-O-R-D.

3508
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,500
So it's totally cool.

3509
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:31,500
Oh, and it's also classified.

3510
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:32,500
Okay.

3511
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:33,500
So here's a classified call.

3512
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:35,500
HQ, come and HQ.

3513
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:38,500
This is Agent 1488 requesting evac.

3514
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:40,500
Do you copy?

3515
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:44,500
HQ, do you copy?

3516
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,500
No answer.

3517
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:51,500
Those godless commies must have come up with a new method of blocking the transflogestennial transmitter.

3518
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,500
I need to get back.

3519
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,500
This intel is too important.

3520
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:58,500
The price of failure too high.

3521
02:29:58,500 --> 02:30:03,500
I promise sensei that I'd never use this, but I may have no other choice.

3522
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,500
I need to do it.

3523
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:09,500
I need to say the N word to hell with the consequences.

3524
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:10,500
No.

3525
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:12,500
Forgive me sensei.

3526
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:13,500
This isn't PC.

3527
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:14,500
This isn't.

3528
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:15,500
Desperate times.

3529
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:16,500
Desperate times.

3530
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,500
What does this have to do with?

3531
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,500
Neoliberals.

3532
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,500
Oh, thank god.

3533
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:21,500
These are close.

3534
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,500
It's all a bunch of filthy neoliberals.

3535
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:23,500
There it is.

3536
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,500
He said he was going to say it.

3537
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:25,500
I don't know.

3538
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:28,500
You've clearly missed the lore, but commie hell has been.

3539
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:32,500
We've been in communication with communist hell and we've been making friends.

3540
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:35,500
It sounds like a better place than normal hell, I guess.

3541
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:36,500
Yeah, absolutely.

3542
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:37,500
It's way more.

3543
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:41,500
Everyone gets the same amount of brimstone in five.

3544
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:43,500
There's no disparity there.

3545
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:46,500
It's a beautiful utopian fantasy.

3546
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:47,500
Next one.

3547
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:49,500
This is from Ototo.

3548
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:51,500
Okay, just get on with it.

3549
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:52,500
Go.

3550
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:56,500
When I was 12, I had a crush on my older step sister.

3551
02:30:56,500 --> 02:31:03,500
I once got close to telling her what her parents were out over the weekend, but I pussied out.

3552
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:04,500
Her parents?

3553
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,500
Are they also your parents?

3554
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:09,500
And she's getting married and I'm still a virgin.

3555
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:16,500
It would have gotten horribly if I told her, but I still think about it to this day.

3556
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:17,500
Is that it?

3557
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:18,500
All right.

3558
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:19,500
Well, you're a freak.

3559
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,500
I understand.

3560
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,500
I'm so sorry, dude.

3561
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:25,500
You know, if only, you know, it could have, you fucked up, dude.

3562
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:29,500
No, I would have gone, it would have been so fucking hot if you'd just been like, hey.

3563
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:30,500
Yeah.

3564
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:31,500
Yeah.

3565
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:35,500
If you just opened up, if you just told her, you'd be, you'd be nailing that.

3566
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:37,500
You'd be hitting that right now.

3567
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:39,500
To this day, you'd be getting married.

3568
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:42,500
You'd be ankle deep right now, this very moment.

3569
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:44,500
You fucking beefed it.

3570
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:46,500
This is on you, my dude.

3571
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:49,500
What is there to say about a situation like that?

3572
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:53,500
Can we like ban all virgins from like doing voicemails?

3573
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:55,500
But then much of them never hear from another.

3574
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:56,500
Our entire audience, yeah.

3575
02:31:56,500 --> 02:32:00,500
Do you want to permanently ban the Teen CP from ever calling in again?

3576
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:01,500
That's not true.

3577
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:02,500
I would say that.

3578
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:03,500
No, listen.

3579
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:04,500
Teen CP is great.

3580
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:05,500
Are they fucking?

3581
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,500
Well, I mean the whole organization.

3582
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:08,500
I mean, every last one of you.

3583
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:09,500
Okay.

3584
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:10,500
Here's the plan.

3585
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:11,500
We ban all virgins.

3586
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:18,500
We ban virgins from voicemails, but if they want them to voicemail, they gotta fuck us, dude.

3587
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:22,500
They gotta fucking beat our meat up in real life and fuck.

3588
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,500
Damn.

3589
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:25,500
That's a good plan.

3590
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,500
That's the loophole.

3591
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:28,500
Official canonized.

3592
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:29,500
There it is.

3593
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,500
Okay.

3594
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:31,500
Next voicemail.

3595
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,500
This is simply called musings from prison.

3596
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:34,500
Let's see what we have here.

3597
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:35,500
Go.

3598
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:43,500
And now musings from prison from the wisest man in voice jail, former CEO of Aldi Corp.

3599
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:44,500
Aldi.

3600
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:45,500
Oh, great.

3601
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:46,500
Welcome home.

3602
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:51,500
A few weeks ago, the video on the egg was brought up, posted by Kurzgesagt, and it's

3603
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:55,980
basically just telling a story for anyone who doesn't know about there being one human

3604
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:56,980
soul.

3605
02:32:56,980 --> 02:32:57,980
It gets reincarnated to all humans.

3606
02:32:57,980 --> 02:33:03,500
And at the end, when it remembers every human experience, it becomes a god.

3607
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:07,260
Now, the point of this isn't to be a comforting tale of reincarnation.

3608
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:13,980
It proposes some values and some questions, like equating effectively universal human knowledge

3609
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:15,500
to godhood.

3610
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:19,180
Other people might say that that level of knowledge would drive you mad, and those come

3611
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:23,980
from different perspectives on life, whether you should pursue as much knowledge as possible

3612
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:26,180
or stay within the confines of your own life.

3613
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:31,100
There's also the question of, would it be worth experiencing all human trauma, which

3614
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:34,940
far outweighs the human pleasure in order to become a god?

3615
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:38,820
Your response to that says a lot about the perspective you come at life from.

3616
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:43,420
In any case, I find it a very interesting story and a good reminder that when it comes

3617
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:48,020
down to it, all humans are ultimately just kind of the same thing, shaped by our different

3618
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:52,940
experiences that lead us into conflict, that can really be resolved if we understood where

3619
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:54,580
the other person is coming.

3620
02:33:54,580 --> 02:33:55,580
That's all from me.

3621
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:59,260
Thanks for listening to Musings from Prison.

3623
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,100
Um, gay!

3624
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:11,660
Okay, I've never heard of the story of the egg, but I had the same idea in college and

3625
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:15,380
I made a Facebook group about a phony religion, about a religion based on it.

3626
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:18,740
We all talked about it, it's been a thousand times, this was a bad voicemail.

3627
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:21,820
We already know this has been the same story.

3628
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:26,820
Okay, well I just wanted to remind anyone who didn't know about that, but okay.

3629
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:30,340
I'll die, fuck you, kill yourself, next voice out.

3630
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:32,340
I had a similar idea, I had an egg today.

3631
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:38,860
I just want to say, I was excited about the reincarnation, not necessarily that everyone

3632
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:45,060
becomes one at the end, but what if you're incarnate, but you exist as your incarnation

3633
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:49,380
at the same time, so maybe a person you walk by the street could be you as a different

3634
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,380
incarnation.

3635
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:54,580
That's what the egg is, it mentions that.

3636
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:59,380
He said in the end, everyone is actually one person, I'm just thinking about, there's

3637
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:03,340
several souls, but they can exist, I don't know.

3638
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:08,340
Maybe it's just Adam and Eve, that's two egg theory, multiple egg theory.

3639
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:11,860
It's a minority scholarly opinion.

3640
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:15,860
There's the egg theory, and the major's proposing the egg carton theory.

3641
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:21,660
There's exactly a dozen of them.

3642
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:26,700
Alright, okay, next one, we've got, this is from, oh yeah, here we go.

3643
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:30,620
Another message from, not even Cluster Punk can save me now.

3644
02:35:30,620 --> 02:35:31,700
Let's see how he's doing, go.

3645
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:34,020
I gotta make this quick, this is the one call I get.

3646
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:36,900
If they find out I'm in direct contact with the PCP, they'll send me straight to the

3647
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:40,380
firing squad for target practice, I need your help, they're charging me for everything

3648
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:43,500
they found in my car, which included a where the reason people are dying t-shirt, they

3649
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:47,820
located in my damn trunk, so now I have a pending homicide charge, and they're trying

3650
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:49,660
to put me away for good in PC prison.

3651
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:52,780
They also tested me and found out that I have AIDS, that they traced back to that slut action

3652
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:54,900
draft, so that isn't helping my case either.

3653
02:35:54,900 --> 02:36:00,020
It's awful, all the inmates are PCP head zoomers, and none of them patron the PCP, they've used

3654
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:03,980
their Jedi mind tricks on the retarded boomer jail security to give them all the bonus episodes

3655
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:04,980
for free.

3656
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:08,540
It's impossible to sleep as the zoomers zoom around their cells in a flamboyant tribal

3657
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:12,220
dance chanting, don't mind at night, don't mind at night, in the morning they engage

3658
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:16,300
in a variety of ritualistic flash mobs to honor their teen CP gods in hopes of one day

3659
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:18,300
ascending to a higher point of existence.

3660
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:24,140
I don't know how much more of this I could take, my chakra levels are on the steep decline

3661
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:29,260
and my Christ consciousness is evaporating, my power levels are so low, sleep evades me,

3662
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:33,860
but when sleep does come, I'm so desperate to escape, I dream I'm rescued, my cold Corona

3663
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:38,540
princess carrying me as he awkwardly bipedal gallops into the sunset, whispering sweet

3664
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:44,740
nothings to me, only to wake up to find I'm still in prison by these simple-minded boomer

3665
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:49,380
overlords and surrounded by zoomic remelans and goblins, please send help, forget voice

3666
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:50,980
jail, I need voice bail.

3667
02:36:53,740 --> 02:36:59,660
We should start, okay, yeah, people in voice grail should start a voice bail fund for the

3668
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:04,780
voice jail, what more can I, I mean, I'm certainly not going to do anything to help

3669
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:07,380
this individual, but maybe you can.

3670
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:09,820
Looks like this guy needs to voice jail, B.A.P.

3671
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:16,660
That's so true, current occupants of the voice grail, we've got them snakes riddle my ass,

3672
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:23,020
Batman, OneSpar, John Oreimo, Hell No Fresh, Lost Tape Archive, Racist Forest Gump, and

3673
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:27,100
apparently Lost Tape Archive is on here twice, let me delete that, if one of you wishes to

3674
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:31,940
step down and free this man from his prison, perhaps, wait, he's not even in PCB voicemail

3675
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:39,060
jail, he's just in regular prison, yeah, he's in regular jail, we can't reach him there,

3676
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:45,420
isn't PC prison, so it's technically still PC prison, yeah, but we don't manage the

3677
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:50,860
PC prison, they're opposed to our existence, it's managed by our enemies, oh yes, yes,

3678
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:55,900
probably the pizza party boys, if I had to guess, all right, let's go on, okay, we've

3679
02:37:55,900 --> 02:38:05,220
got, this is the PCPFC of the PCR of communist hell, is what this is, okay, why, just listen

3680
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:06,220
to it, go.

3681
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:12,260
Hello, this is the comrade Mao, party secretary to state cancer of procrastinator's podcast

3682
02:38:12,260 --> 02:38:17,300
fan club of the people's communist republic of communist hell, here's my understanding

3683
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:22,700
that you have been contacted by a decanter revolutionary dissident, J. Graver was a ghost,

3684
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:28,380
you have been spreading anti-PCPFCPCRCH propaganda throughout the communist hell,

3685
02:38:28,380 --> 02:38:33,660
yeah, I remember that, we have the PCPFCPCRCH want to make very clear that we are the only

3686
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:39,180
valid recognized PCP fan club in the communist hell, and this uncertainty will be cross beneath

3687
02:38:39,180 --> 02:38:45,100
our iron fist, ex-comrade Graver, we will find you and you'll be spending a very wrong time

3688
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:52,140
in the cosmo fraud to go good, oh, hello comrade Stalin, I just called PCP voicemail, you want

3689
02:38:52,140 --> 02:39:05,740
to say anything, okay, here you go, hello, this is general secretary Stalin of the PCPFCPCRCH,

3690
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:11,660
they have composed poem for the PCP, I am very excited to recite it for you, all right,

3691
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:20,620
yet or miss, perhaps it is they do not miss, you have boyfriend, perhaps it is he not give

3692
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:28,460
kiss, he will leave you and find that nothing is amiss, he will do like with Khalifa and give

3693
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:38,860
kiss, thank you, and they say and they say that communism doesn't create great art,

3694
02:39:39,580 --> 02:39:45,500
yeah, yeah, something about those voices make me think of it as like a Muppet show thing,

3695
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:51,660
no, no, I'll tell you why, because of Team America, the guy said I exactly like the

3696
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:55,500
rendition of the communist leader from North Korea and that, exactly like it,

3697
02:39:56,220 --> 02:40:01,740
that's, I don't know why, those are so funny, the chairman Mao one is so fucking funny, all

3698
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:08,460
right, can we send them to voicemail? Yeah, you know what, you're absolutely right there, Ben,

3699
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:13,180
let me see, I'm just going to send, okay, so these guys are on the same team, now that Che Guevara

3700
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:18,940
rascal, he is operating on a separate organization, now we respect him as well, but so this is the,

3701
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:22,780
let me see if I get this right, that we of course bear respects to Che Guevara,

3702
02:40:23,500 --> 02:40:34,940
of course, the PCPCRHK, what the fuck, it's the PCPFCPCRCH, there it is, yep,

3703
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:40,300
that's what I said, okay, I'm adding that to the voice grail, so that's our boys chairman Mao

3704
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:45,820
and the other guy, Stan, okay, great, fantastic, good work everyone, let me just clear the form,

3705
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:50,540
okay, there we go, all right, we got another one here, this is from, let me see,

3706
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:55,980
oh, Cam Smithical, Cam Smithical, I can't remember that name from somewhere,

3707
02:40:55,980 --> 02:41:00,060
I know that name, he helped, he helped on the Minecraft server, he helped people,

3708
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:05,820
yes, that's right, back in those days, Bufalantopia, okay, well it's the bygone era, Bufalantopia,

3709
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:12,780
the bygone era, we shall rebuild, go, hey guys, it's Cam Smithical, the Catechery Will

3710
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:17,580
or Minecraft guy, it's been a pretty good month so far, I played Minecraft with a few,

3711
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:21,820
got added to Mage's Discord, the thing that got me into the PCP three years ago,

3712
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:26,380
Steven Universe, came to a head with its movie, I genuinely enjoyed the movie,

3713
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:32,220
and Miss Squish and Stretch herself, Spinel, reminds me a lot of myself, pink hair,

3714
02:41:32,220 --> 02:41:38,380
wants you guys to have fun at Bufalantopia, waiting for you to come back to play with me again,

3715
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:47,100
speaking of which, what's the next stream guys, it's been about six days, that's like 6,000 years,

3716
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:53,260
is it me, did I do something wrong, in Minecraft time, I'm here,

3717
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:15,660
oh Cam buddy, don't do it, this is definitely, oh, Cam buddy, that's it, that's it, that's

3718
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:22,780
is this the end of Cam Smithical, uh, voice jail, will we ever go back, no I can't do it,

3719
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:28,380
I can't do it, I will put a good voice grail, he's a good man, he didn't do anything wrong,

3720
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:33,820
he put music to it, I won't cotton to this emotional terrorism,

3721
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:40,860
let's give him one more chance, just like Spinel, he's just been horribly abused by his evil

3722
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:46,700
creators who left him alone with no love and no hope for his future, and it was epic, he's still

3723
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:53,500
doing 360s on his way lord waiting for us, oh, Cam buddy, Cam you gotta come with that sick kata

3724
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:58,380
curry skin to the new server whenever we get it going on, I, you know, I don't know if any of us

3725
02:42:58,380 --> 02:43:02,700
are like, actually I'm not even gonna entertain the idea of letting people in for free, let's not

3726
02:43:02,700 --> 02:43:07,980
even go there, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna say okay, biggest mistake, and I won't do this

3727
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:14,540
again in the Minecraft server was evolving my, um, vibrava, because the way vibrava flies is so

3728
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:18,940
funny, because when you, yeah, yeah, because when you, um, when you have a fly gun, you just sit on

3729
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:25,740
the flygun's back, but the vibrava just, he just uses its little fire, or a dragonfly arms, it just

3730
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:31,820
holds you by the head underneath it, and just like flies you around, it's way cooler, that is way

3731
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:37,260
cooler, yeah, uh, that's good, oh man, just playing that song made me a little bit

3732
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:42,700
uncomfortably emotional, uh, during this little camp, that was his plan all along, he's just trying

3733
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:47,340
to fuck with you, he's trying to get you, don't let him, yeah, yeah, and, and he's literally dressed

3734
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:52,780
as kata curry, like the most character for one piece, I love, beyond all others, this guy's

3735
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:57,580
really trying to get, and riding way lord, the most emotional pokemon of all, I cry every time I think

3736
02:43:57,580 --> 02:44:06,860
about way lord, it's so big, I want one, I really want one, yeah, uh, okay, all right, we got, we got

3737
02:44:06,860 --> 02:44:13,020
one last voicemail, um, and this is, oh, coming out from the dirt, it's, it's mozilla fennekin,

3738
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:17,420
he's managed to smell the loud, one more take from the voice jail, all right, this is the last

3739
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:21,820
one, I wonder how many cigarettes did he have to trade to a guard to get him to bring this to us,

3740
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:27,340
oh boy, all right, let's, how many bottles of jankum did he have to produce and trade?

3741
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:32,620
all right, let's, let's roll it out, mozilla, go

3742
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:36,620

3768
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:04,620

Oh god

02:45:32,180 --> 02:45:34,180
The power and that performance

3776
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:39,100
We try to do is he's trying to try to like endear himself to us

3777
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:41,100
So we get him out of voice gray or jail

3778
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:44,220
That's what he's trying to do is trying to get us to make him in voice grail instead

3779
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:46,220
We can't let him have a phone

3780
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:52,300
Who let him have a phone and down again jankum comes at a high price. He gets to trade that

3781
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:05,140
Well, so so is that is that no he's still in voice jail one jokes, you know pretty good
