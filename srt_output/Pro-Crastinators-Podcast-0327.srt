1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey Ben, you ever seen The Monkey That Hides From Gay People?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Uh, got him.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Got him.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tricking the block.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I see, I see.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You never heard that bit?

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You ever heard like that dick?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, I've never heard that.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah, I killed him.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The original version is like, have you heard of the clown that hides from gay people?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And the whole idea is you tell that to a young boy and he's like, he hears the word gay and

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
he's like, I don't want them to think I'm gay so he rushes to say no.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And not realizing that he only hides from gay people.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I mean, he wouldn't, but he's telling the truth because he wouldn't have seen him.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Because there is no such clown.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, he's probably gay then.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, if you haven't seen him, most likely you're just gay.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I haven't seen him.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Exactly.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I haven't seen him either, to be honest.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What if you're bi?

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've been looking.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What if you're bi?

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Does he sort of...

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You see like half of the clown?

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He's like, he's like bleeding out on the ground.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Look at him.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He's screaming.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He's screaming.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He got Harry Potter teleportation fucked up, split in half.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He got bi-sected.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He tried to transition.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He tried to transition using Harry Potter magic, but it triggered the kill.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was the slice switch.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Rowling built a...

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Built a kill, a kill, a safeguard into her spells.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And if anyone tries to transition genderly using Harry Potter magic, it'll activate the

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
kill switch.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It kills them instantly.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kills them instantly.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please shut the fuck up.

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All the wands are transphobic.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So if you're a different gender than when the wands chose you, it just blows up in your

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
face.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,800
You know, it never says it in the books, but actually, which is actually have wands that

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,000
are shaped like vaginas?

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,640
Whereas only male wizards use the dick shaped wands that are long and phallic.

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,440
It never says otherwise.

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
You can't prove that it doesn't say that in the book.

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Like a police badge?

65
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Like they hold it up?

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
The vagina-shaped wooden thing?

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I guess.

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Yeah, I guess.

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Or maybe it's like a...

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Like a Jackie Chan Adventures talisman.

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Yeah.

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Yeah, it's a talisman.

74
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Yes.

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,520
It never says...

76
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Show me where in the books it says that Hermione's wand is long and stick-like.

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
It doesn't.

78
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
It never says...

79
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Just like it never says that she isn't...

80
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,520
It never says that she's white, except for that one time, but it mostly doesn't, so...

81
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
It never says Harry Potter's white either.

82
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,520
That's right, except for probably a bunch of times.

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
You know, it never says Voldemort...

84
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Describes you to his pale.

85
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
It never says Voldemort's white.

86
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
No.

87
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
No?

88
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Definitely.

89
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
It's Voldemort.

90
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,020
Harry Potter was pretty problematic.

91
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,020
He canceled that BIPOC villain, BIPOC dictator eugenicist.

92
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,020
They canceled...

93
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,020
They tried to kill that one guy who was trying to prevent the Holocaust, but that's...

94
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
Yeah.

95
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Because preventing the Holocaust is just as evil as...

96
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Johnny Depp is...

97
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Is Johnny Depp white?

98
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Yeah, he's white.

99
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
He just larps as British.

100
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
He's so tan.

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
He's so tan, though.

102
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Yeah, that's how he gets you.

103
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,020
You ever seen the original Nightmare on Elm Street?

104
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
He's like pale in that movie.

105
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Johnny Depp was in the original Nightmare on Elm Street?

106
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Yeah, oh yeah, he is.

107
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
He fucking...

108
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
No, I've never seen that.

109
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
He played the Elm.

110
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Yep.

111
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,020
He played him, and I only know this because my partner's a huge Freddy Krueger nut, but

112
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
he's the guy who...

113
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,520
Do you remember the death where a guy gets sucked into a bed and then a blood guy shoots

114
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
out from the bed?

115
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
I have seen that, yeah.

116
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah, that's Johnny Depp's stuff.

117
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
What?

118
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Really?

119
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Wow.

120
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Yeah, really.

121
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Then he comes back for the sixth film for a quick joke where a guy is watching TV, and

122
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,920
then Johnny Depp shows up as his character from the first movie, and they're doing a whole

123
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,320
bit about, like, this is your brain on drugs, and then Freddy hits his face with a frying

124
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,520
pan, and he's like, that's your brain.

125
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,520
I don't know what drugs you're on.

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Right.

127
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Yeah, I know.

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Yeah.

129
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I know my Freddy Krueger, Lauren.

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,520
I'll buy a choice, because I just live with someone who's always talking about it.

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
I see, I see.

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
I've never watched an entire Nightmare on Elm Street.

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh, you should.

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
It's kind of like your life story.

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Oh, really?

136
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Oh, it happens when you're awake.

137
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
The life of Freddy Krueger?

138
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Are you saying that I'm Freddy?

139
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah, you're Freddy.

140
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
You got burned alive when you came back.

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Yeah.

142
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,520
You got burned on Twitter alive when you came back.

143
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Sounds like me.

144
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
You got ratioed on Twitter.

145
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
It's pretty much the same, yeah.

146
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Yeah, well, a heart attack, and then Dream Demon showed up and said, Ben, say, you're

147
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
the angriest man on Twitter.

148
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,520
We're going to bring you back, and if you ratio someone on Twitter, they die in real life.

149
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,520
That tracks with my experience, yeah.

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,520
I've got a, my friggin, my friggin microphone is in a weird position because I am in a new

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:52,520
house now, and my freaking microphone stand does not stick to my desk because it just

152
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,520
doesn't have the lip on it for it to clamp onto.

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,520
So, I had to put my mic, clamp it onto my side table and move my side table next to

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
my desk, and now it's kind of awkwardly sort of sticking up over the side of the table

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,520
and leaning over in front of me, and I have to sort of turn two different ways to speak

156
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,520
into the mic versus not speak into the, to look at my screen, I have to look this way,

157
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,520
and then to speak into the mic, I have to turn this way.

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
It's bugging me.

159
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
It's bugging me, yeah.

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
It's like I'm there.

161
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
You hear the difference perhaps.

162
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm there, like, crouching with my ear, pressed up against your mouth, hearing everything.

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
This is a 4D podcast.

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
You smell a vision.

165
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
You can smell Ben St.

166
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
You can smell Ben St. through the microphone if you're leaning real close.

167
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Just rub your screen that you're listening to on the phone or a desktop, and you can

168
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,520
smell Ben St. with future air coming out of your screen.

169
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm breathing directly into your ear.

170
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,520
We've got to make sure Ben St. stops breathing.

171
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Can you smell the, can you smell last night's pepperoni?

172
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,520
For every, for every $5, for every $5 you sent to Trixie's Patreon, Ben will breathe

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
one second less.

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Let's crack up that numbers.

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Boys, let's go.

176
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
It's a great, it's a red letter week for me.

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,520
I moved to a new house that isn't a disgusting whole.

178
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
I live in a real room now.

179
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
I feel great.

180
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
And also Trixie is dead and I killed her.

181
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Oh, she retired, yeah.

182
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
She's dead.

183
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Ben St. has taken another trans woman's job.

184
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Excellent.

185
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I mean, job.

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I mean, job.

187
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Oh, quote on quote, yeah.

188
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Yeah.

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
It's, it's crazy.

190
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Most retirements imply you have like enough money to live comfortably.

191
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Most retirements, usually a retirement is from something.

192
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Right, yeah.

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Somebody, somebody, somebody posted, oh, somebody posted on Twitter a, just a gif of a Seinfeld

194
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,520
where Kramer says like, I'm retiring and Jerry says from what?

195
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Yeah.

196
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Got him.

197
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
That was good.

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
And then Kramer says like, you know what?

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Fuck you, Jerry.

200
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Okay.

201
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
You know what, Jerry?

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Fuck you.

203
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm, I'm bi-bogging.

204
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
You can't talk to me that way.

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,520
I was, I was trying to quote that there's this one like edited, there's like this one

206
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,520
audio where it's, it's like the clip from SpongeBob where it's where the word is like taking

207
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
some guy's order and he's like being sarcastic the whole time.

208
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
And then someone like adds audio of the fish guy saying like, you know what?

209
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Fuck you, Squidward.

210
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,520
And then he goes on like a two minute, like Mr. Anter style like rant of like, is it nice

211
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
and like, and like SpongeBob is.

212
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,520
And there was like so many people saying like, oh my God, this is so like, like funny.

213
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
And I'm thinking like, no, this sucks.

214
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
This is fucking cringe.

215
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I could imagine it being funny.

216
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
I mean, was it supposed to be sincere?

217
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Like a sincere like takedown of the character of Squidward?

218
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,520
No, nobody, nobody talks about this, but actually Squidward is very, he's a very mean

219
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
guy actually.

220
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I think that's actually a pretty unpleasant individual when you, when you think about it.

221
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,520
You know, no one, I don't think I've seen anyone really point this out, but Squidward,

222
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
not, not a good person.

223
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Not a good person.

224
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,520
I can see why he's not preferred among the townspeople in Bikini Bottom.

225
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Actually, when you think about it, Mr. Burns actually is a pretty, is a pretty bad dude.

226
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
He actually does bad things with his money.

227
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,520
He does not, yeah, does not help the people of Springfield very much.

228
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Very morally questionable.

229
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,520
He's very, well, you know, he's, he's, he's, he's a, he's morally complex.

230
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
He's gray.

231
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
He's morally gray.

232
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
He's complicated.

233
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
So we stan.

234
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
I, I, I hate that.

235
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
I hate audio.

236
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Cause I know Squidward would just interrupt and say like, all right, all right, all right.

237
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Yeah.

238
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,520
I think I listened to a bit of it.

239
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,520
And it was just sort of like, I don't know.

240
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Would you like some wine with that cheese on that Krabby Patty?

241
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah.

242
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's like giving a platform to this fish, but like he's just, the bit goes on too long.

243
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Like we get it.

244
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,520
He, that, that was rude, sir.

245
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I mean, I was like, he doesn't need to go on like a family guy bit about it.

246
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Yes.

247
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Oh my God.

248
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Yeah.

249
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I was going to compare it to that one speech.

250
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Quagmire.

251
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Quagmire.

252
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
That's what I was thinking.

253
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Is it like that?

254
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Cause that's genuine.

255
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
That I was thinking.

256
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Yeah.

257
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,520
That, that speech is also very like, does it really like, I think they were trying to

258
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
illustrate that like, even someone as bad as Quagmire, this is like Brian, but it's like,

259
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Quagmire is like a rapist and implied to have an incest.

260
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Sometimes he is.

261
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Yeah.

262
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
So it's like.

263
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
He is.

264
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Yeah.

265
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
You know, sometimes it's okay when a rapist lecturers, sometimes it's okay.

266
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Yeah.

267
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah.

268
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
It's a little weird.

269
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I mean, I think they did that because I think there probably was a lot of the audience that

270
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,520
didn't get that they were going for that, for like a, a douchebag with Brian and I mean,

271
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,520
I guess it's sort of their fault for not making it clear enough before it's their, it's their

272
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
fault that they had to, that they felt the need to clarify.

273
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Like you're actually not really supposed to agree with Brian about stuff.

274
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
You know.

275
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,520
All the time, except sometimes, except sometimes you definitely are though.

276
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
So.

277
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,520
You know, I just realized now that stuff, stuff like Barlin has played two different animal

278
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,520
characters that are like pure white.

279
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
The other one, the bear.

280
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
No, he doesn't play the bear.

281
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Well, he doesn't.

282
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Yeah, he might.

283
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah.

284
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah.

285
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, he plays it.

286
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh my God.

287
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Oh, if I just fucking realize another character that's like pure white that he plays.

288
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
So he plays Brian, who's white.

289
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,520
And then he plays like the, the rat, the rat from the animated movie sing.

290
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
It was also like pure white.

291
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I don't know that one.

292
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,520
You should, you should look a look of rat from sing stuff like Barlin rat from sing.

293
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,520
And he's like, you're saying, sing is an animated movie about like singing animals and

294
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
like a contest.

295
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I've never seen that, but it sort of looked.

296
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Oh, yes.

297
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Yes.

298
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,520
What was the other thing like the pets thing?

299
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,520
It was just like a secret life of secret life of pets.

300
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I thought he wasn't in that.

301
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
He wasn't in that one.

302
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
They came out the same year.

303
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I think those movies, the singing for a life of pets.

304
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,520
So, so that's two characters, but the secret third white character that Seth McFarlane plays

305
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
is he plays himself.

306
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I forget the name.

307
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
I forget the name of the character.

308
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
He's the white cartoon character.

309
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,520
He's in, he's in Hellboy two and he plays that one German ghost guy who's in the scuba

310
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
diver suit.

311
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
He's like a pure white ghost.

312
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Really?

313
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Yeah.

314
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
He's like a big house.

315
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Yeah.

316
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Hellboy.

317
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Seth McFarlane, Hellboy two.

318
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Did you not know Ron Prover played Hellboy?

319
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
I forgot, but not that I think about it.

320
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Not that I think about it.

321
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
That makes perfect sense.

322
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Man, I'm looking at, man, this Doug Jones guy is a really weird looking dude.

323
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I guess that's why they picked him to play a fucked up fish.

324
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Oh, yeah.

325
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,520
He only plays, he only plays like characters that are like coated in like three layers of

326
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
special effects makeup.

327
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
That's like his gimmick.

328
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
He's weird looking in real life.

329
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
He has like, he's also super skinny.

330
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,520
So like he's perfect for those roles because he could just keep stacking shit on his face

331
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,520
and it won't look like, it won't look like his head is like massive with all that stuff

332
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
on it.

333
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,520
So it looks kind of like normal human proportions.

334
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Yeah.

335
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Cool.

336
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I met him in real life actually.

337
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
You met him in real life?

338
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Yeah.

339
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I met him at Comic Con.

340
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
He hugged me.

341
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Oh, wow.

342
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
And he told me, I have a shirt that said I'm a huge asshole.

343
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I was wearing that to Comic Con.

344
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,520
And he saw that shirt and he told me that like after he hugged me, he's like, yeah,

345
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I promise you got to stop being a huge asshole.

346
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
And I'm like, all right, I will.

347
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I've been breaking that promise a lot recently actually.

348
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,520
So he, oh, I see the, I mean, you can't, you can't really see his face at all.

349
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
This diver guy.

350
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,520
No, he's like, he's like a phantom something.

351
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,520
He's like a mist inside of his helmet.

352
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
And that's him, I guess.

353
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah.

354
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,520
In the comic, he like accidentally becomes mist because he was doing a seance at the wrong

355
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
time.

356
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,520
He hated when I do a seance at the wrong time.

357
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
He'd become mist.

358
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
That face.

359
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
No, I'm not right.

360
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,520
POV, you did your seance wrong and now you're mist.

361
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Yeah, he fucking mist.

362
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I think in the comic though, that's like very, it's like a three page origin story basically.

363
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
He's doing a seance.

364
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Meanwhile, the other side of the earth, the Chinese are doing like supernatural experiments

365
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
at the same time.

366
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,520
And this just kind of like is a, is a string of bad events and he just instantly gets ghost

367
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,520
defied daddy phantom style.

368
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
And he, he's like, oh fuck, I'm a mist ghost.

369
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
I got to live in this scuba diving suit.

370
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
I just found this on Google images.

371
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
So I guess I might as well post it.

372
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I don't know.

373
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Hey, it's too, it's a reference.

374
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Hey, it's a reference that I get.

375
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,520
This is, this is so, I was about to say this feels so 20 2008.

376
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,520
And then I look, I'm like, yeah, but I think it's self aware, but it's self aware.

377
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,520
So I mean, it's drawn in, I think it's, I think it's deliberately a penny arcade sort

378
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
of looking or CAD looking thing.

379
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah.

380
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Yeah.

381
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Yeah.

382
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
It's like, it'd be that era where all the penny arcade.

383
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,520
That's like the time Peter Griffin double in the first hell boy.

384
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Action.

385
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Oh, oh, oh my gosh.

386
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
This is awful.

387
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Hello, son of a hellboy.

388
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Remember, you remember that part in Sonichu where they do a cutaway gag to Peter Griffin

389
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:57,520
joining the ghostbusters, not, not like the Egon and, and, and Venkman ghostbusters,

390
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
but the other ghostbusters.

391
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Talk about the one that had the gorilla.

392
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Yes.

393
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Yes.

394
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Yeah.

395
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Yeah.

396
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
The one that predates the ghostbusters that everyone actually likes.

397
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Yeah.

398
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Well, it predates the cartoon.

399
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
I'm not sure if it predates the movie.

400
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
It predates, it does predate the movie.

401
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh, okay.

402
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Yeah.

403
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
All right.

404
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
I've never seen it.

405
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I just am aware of it.

406
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Yeah.

407
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,520
They made that cartoon and then when they were trying to make their own ghostbusters cartoon

408
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,520
based on the Bill Murray movie, they couldn't call it the ghostbusters.

409
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
It sounded like a dig.

410
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
They called it the real ghostbusters, right?

411
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah, the shit on the original.

412
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Fuck.

413
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
That's awesome.

414
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I think more things should do that.

415
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I think they should reboot Steven Universe and call it the real Steven Universe.

416
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
No, no, no.

417
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
This is somebody else.

418
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Just somebody else makes another completely unrelated show and call it the real Steven

419
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Universe.

420
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,520
And it's just not like a guy living in LA or something.

421
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
It's like a white guy.

422
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Yeah.

423
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
A white straight guy.

424
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,520
He only thinks that would hetero people.

425
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
That's the gimmick.

426
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
That's the gimmick.

427
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
It's like, what if Steven Universe was straight and then all these like...

428
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
What if he was on the straight and narrow and he never met anyone as clear?

429
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Steven Universe was straight.

430
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
It's the plot of the real Steven Universe.

431
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Steven Universe was hetero sexual instead of all this gay baby shit he used to do.

432
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,520
It takes place actually after Steven Universe Future.

433
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Steven goes on his little red trip, comes out straight from that.

434
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Comes out straight, starts a business.

435
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,520
What if Lars comes back from his space odyssey and he's like, wow, the space radiation turned

436
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
me straight?

437
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Steven, what do I do?

438
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Lars comes back and he's like, I'm transphobic now, Steven.

439
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,520
And Steven's like, yeah, me too, actually.

440
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
God.

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
It's an awesome idea for a cartoon, 10 out of 10.

442
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,520
My new housemates are going to hear me screeching and cackling and think that I'm a freak.

443
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
They're going to think like this.

444
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,520
The first thing you do when you get in is just laugh to yourself, really loud.

445
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
They're going to think this guy laughs.

446
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
This guy is entertained.

447
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
What a server.

448
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,520
They're all like, wait a minute, I recognize that voice and they check.

449
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Is that Ben St. from the Procrastinators podcast?

450
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I love Ben St. Vapors.

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
I love Slime and Punishment.

452
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Oh my God.

453
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Is that Ben St.?

454
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
He was my least favorite member of the podcast.

455
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Fuck, he lives in my house.

456
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Ben St. the guy who ruined the PCP with his left, shoving his lefty politics to everything.

457
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I fucking hate that guy.

458
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm going to post on Kiwi Forms about this.

459
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I'm going to find this address.

460
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
We got to kill him.

461
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Uh-oh, where's it gone?

462
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Wait, where's Kiwi Form?

463
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Wait, where'd it go?

464
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Where did it go?

465
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
No.

466
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Did you hear?

467
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I know yesterday it was that they got like some sort of server in Russia now,

468
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
but even that got taken down apparently.

469
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I saw, um-

470
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Lol.

471
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Yeah, today?

472
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
No, I think I saw today or yesterday that like, now when you load it up,

473
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
it's like due to an imminent threat to human life.

474
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Cloudflare is no longer hosting this fucking-

475
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah, blocked.

476
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
What happened?

477
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Due to an imminent and emergency threat to human life,

478
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,520
the constant of the site is blocked from being accessed through Cloudflare's infrastructure.

479
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
So, you know.

480
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Interesting.

481
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
And then it links to a blog post directly from Kiwi Forms,

482
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
or no, from Cloudflare, not from Kiwi Forms.

483
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Oh yeah, they dropped the whole article about it.

484
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Yeah.

485
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Wow, okay.

486
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
So that's serious.

487
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
That's serious business.

488
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I saw that whole tweet about a way to hold up every one moment.

489
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Eleazar, I'm sorry to keep changing my volume.

490
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I just have to keep moving my head left and right to speak into the microphone

491
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
versus look at a screen.

492
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I gotta get my screen time.

493
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Go back to the party.

494
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm very hungover, by the way.

495
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Oh.

496
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm a little bit hungover, yeah.

497
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I didn't drink that much.

498
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I just didn't hydrate.

499
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I didn't drink any water before I went to bed, and it's-

500
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
And I ate pepperoni pizza.

501
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Yeah, so the dehydration-

502
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
is what's killing me right now.

503
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,520
That's like the perfect recipe for acid reflux.

504
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Oh, it was so good, though.

505
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Oh, it was so good.

506
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
It was worth it.

507
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I would do it again.

508
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
I love sin.

509
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Ben, how?

510
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Let me sin.

511
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
I love sin.

512
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
I love crime.

513
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
I hate the cops.

514
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I love to engage in antisocial behavior.

515
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Ben, how did the filming go?

516
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Oh, did I not talk about that last week?

517
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Did I do that?

518
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Well, you were about to do it.

519
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Oh, my God.

520
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
But we were doing the thing.

521
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,520
And so, in the week since you have done it, I hear-

522
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
God, so much, so much shit happened this week.

523
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
Wow, I can't believe it's all the same week.

524
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Wow, wow.

525
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Oh, man, I'm overwhelmed.

526
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Ah, ah, I can't see.

527
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Ah, like, ah, I'm over, I can't-

528
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
I'm blinded.

529
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Ah!

530
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
You know, there are some weeks-

531
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm not being overwhelmed.

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,520
There are some, there are some decades where nothing happens

533
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,520
and there are some weeks where decades happen.

534
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
You know what I'm saying?

535
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Yeah, I gotcha.

536
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,520
This was a, yeah, well, I filmed the thing

537
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
and I'll just tell, I told you already,

538
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
but I have 14 hours of footage,

539
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
which I will have to cut down.

540
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,520
I expect it will cut down into maybe something like eight.

541
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
To 10 hours, perhaps.

542
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I think it came out okay.

543
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Part of me wants to-

544
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I haven't started editing it.

545
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Part of me thinks that I might start editing it

546
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
and decide it's bad and I should just do it again.

547
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,520
There's a non-zero chance that I will just simply do it again

548
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
because my speech is annoying.

549
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I feel like I said, ah, ah, ah, too much.

550
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
You just gotta cut that out.

551
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
I will try my best to cut that out.

552
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Sometimes I do it in the middle of a sentence, though,

553
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
in a way that is hard to cut around.

554
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Make it a drinking game.

555
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm gonna start editing and maybe I'll edit an hour of it

556
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,520
and then I'll watch that back and if the hour sucks,

557
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I might just be like, okay, that was just my first take.

558
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,520
That was just practice run. Let me just do it for real.

559
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
But I don't know. It might be okay.

560
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
I'll have to see.

561
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,520
But yeah, I spent two days. I woke up.

562
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I woke up, yeah, right after the PCP last week,

563
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I set up the shot and it took me-

564
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,520
actually, it took me quite a long time to get the shot set up.

565
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I didn't actually start recording until like 2 p.m. or something.

566
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
So, yeah, I didn't start recording for several hours

567
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
because I had to set it all up.

568
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
And then I went all day until the sun was down

569
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
and it was dark, so I did not get to keep sunlight.

570
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,520
It was okay. The shot was bright enough with the spotlight

571
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
even when the sun went down and it was dark.

572
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
The only difference is that when the sun was down,

573
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
the shadow behind me got really deep.

574
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
So, you can see the shot stays lit,

575
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,520
but the shadow behind me gets darker and darker

576
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,520
as the sun goes down because of the secondary lighting went away.

577
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
And then I woke up early the next day

578
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
and then I started in the morning and then I just went all day.

579
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
And the sun went down again.

580
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,520
So, you can see the sunrise inset twice during this 14 hours

581
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
that I was recording.

582
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It was really epic.

583
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Yeah, I think so.

584
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,520
I hope it turns out good.

585
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
It's going to take me a while to cut it all down.

586
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Is the whole thing actually going to be 8 hours?

587
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,520
I would expect it will cut down to something like 8 to 10 hours.

588
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
We're going to sound like a bunch of hippie crits

589
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,520
and we start shitting on Unique Namosaurus later on this podcast.

590
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Man, fuck Unique Namosaurus. I fucking hate him.

591
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
He's not merely an NFT shill.

592
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
He's a fucking douchebag. He's a fucking twat.

593
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
He's a fucking idiot and he's a little pussy bitch.

594
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Little pussy bitch, little coward,

595
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
suicide-baiting bitch-man.

596
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Yeah, I haven't followed that.

597
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
I've seen bits of it and I was like,

598
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,520
oh, an 8 hour video? Well, I mean, I don't care.

599
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Whatever. I do know about that artist

600
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,520
because I followed them and I liked their art

601
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
and then they started doing NFTs.

602
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
I was like, okay, fuck it.

603
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,520
And then I unfollowed and that was the end of my interaction.

604
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I had never seen that artist before.

605
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,520
They just made cute little moving gifts

606
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,520
with big booby anime girls and I was like, that's cute.

607
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Well, who could say no to that?

608
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,520
It's so, I think, I guess, to kind of help people

609
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
who don't know what we're talking about.

610
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
There's a guy called Unique Namosaurus

611
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
and he's a YouTuber.

612
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I had seen him in the context of his pro piracy video.

613
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,520
He made an anime video about how piracy is good

614
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
and you should pirate anime, which was cool and I liked it.

615
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Years ago.

616
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Yeah, and that's usually how that starts, right?

617
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
They make a video earlier on in their career

618
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
and that's super cool and then later,

619
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
they're more shittier take-start.

620
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I said that's how it starts.

621
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,520
They have these epic and base takes with their early videos

622
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
and then later they're kind of shittier take-start surfacing.

623
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Are you just talking about YouTubers in general?

624
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, just YouTubers in general.

625
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
People I hate, you know.

626
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
People I hate.

627
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
People I hate is usually how it starts.

628
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,520
They have one good take and then they get your guard down

629
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
and then they hit you.

630
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
And then they hit you with their real opinion.

631
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Right.

632
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,520
And after that, his worst take was abolishing copyright,

633
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
which I technically agree,

634
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,520
but I don't think it would work in today's society.

635
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,520
I think I, yeah, I don't know.

636
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I haven't seen that video.

637
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
I think I like it.

638
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I think I'm generally pro.

639
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,520
I haven't seen the video in a while,

640
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
but I do remember some key moments.

641
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
What about copyright?

642
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Copyright law mostly punishes the little guy

643
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,520
in favor of the big guy at this point in time.

644
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,520
He kind of frames it as the like,

645
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,520
if a corporation fails to deliver on something,

646
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,520
then people should just use the copyright.

647
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,520
The free market should allow.

648
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Yeah, like the ultimate free market argument.

649
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm pro market when it comes to things of no real consequence,

650
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,520
like fucking, you know, IPs and shows and whatever.

651
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
So I mean, sounds fine.

652
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Sounds fine.

653
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah, but he gave this one example that would never happen.

654
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
And like, it would never happen like now or in the next,

655
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I didn't think it would happen in the next 50 years.

656
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I think we'll probably be dead when this,

657
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,520
like this example could be fully applied in real life.

658
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,520
But he said that like, imagine, imagine if you will,

659
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Disney makes bad Star Wars movies.

660
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Just imagine that.

661
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Okay, sorry.

662
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
This is strengthening my suspension of disbelief a little bit.

663
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Okay, let's say this.

664
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Okay.

665
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Let's just say you live in a world where they make bad Star Wars

666
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
movie and also copyright is abolish.

667
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Now, like nothing is literally stopping like a group of people

668
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
going on Kickstarter saying like, we're going to kickstart

669
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,520
the good Star Wars movie, just give us this money

670
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,520
and we're going to compete at the same level.

671
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
We're going to make the last Jedi or no,

672
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
what's the good one?

673
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
What's the Ryan Johnson one?

674
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Yeah, the last Jedi.

675
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Is that the last Jedi?

676
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
We're going to remake the last Jedi,

677
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,520
but we're not going to have Luke be such a pussy.

678
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
He's going to be, he's definitely not going to do,

679
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,520
think about killing, what's his name?

680
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Hello.

681
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Adam Driver.

682
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
He's going to be.

683
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Ray is definitely going to have a connection to someone

684
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
from previously in the series.

685
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Like she's not going to be a complete,

686
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
strangely come out of nowhere because that's weird.

687
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
That's just, man, that's too different.

688
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
It doesn't make any sense.

689
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I can't take it.

690
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Then why would she be special if she wasn't Palpatine's

691
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
granddaughter?

692
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm sorry.

693
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Why would she be special if she has a vagina that doesn't

694
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
make any sense?

695
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
That's an argument for.

696
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Lightsaber is in the shape of a penis.

697
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Yeah, it never says in the movies,

698
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,520
but the female Jedi all have vagina shaped lightsabers,

699
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
obviously.

700
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Obviously.

701
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,520
So he's arguing that with no copyright,

702
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
just the little man, just any people could create

703
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
a movie at the same level of the last Jedi

704
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
to compete against.

705
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Well, if there was no copyright law that was actionable

706
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,520
to stop other people making Star Wars movies,

707
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
then how would corporations,

708
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
corporations couldn't do anything?

709
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,520
I think that if you think of what it would be like,

710
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,520
it's like, oh, you go to the theater and there's multiple

711
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
different films called Star Wars that are made by

712
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,520
different studios and they're just playing at the same time.

713
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Both of the films are going to suffer because people

714
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
have to choose one or the other.

715
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
They're probably not going to watch both.

716
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,520
So it's the same as somebody releasing a game,

717
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,520
and a similar kind of game with more marketing behind it

718
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,520
is released around the same time.

719
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,520
First game is just going to suffer for being similar

720
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
to the other one.

721
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
So you'd want to spread it out.

722
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
I don't know.

723
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
I don't think they would make a lot of money,

724
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,520
but in practice, yeah, I think the one with more funding

725
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
would tend to succeed.

726
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Sometimes maybe a corporation would fuck up and make

727
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,520
a shitty movie and somebody else would make a good one.

728
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
A Kickstarter would never, like,

729
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
not in a fucking million years be able to crank up

730
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
as much money as a Star Wars movie ever.

731
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,520
And then even if they get enough to make a decent movie,

732
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
people are going to be...

733
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Disney also has ad money.

734
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
They could probably even do smear campaigns

735
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
against a smaller movie.

736
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,520
A lot could be fucking done to prevent these smaller ones.

737
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,520
And to even get to the first place now,

738
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,520
like, oh, there's no copyright laws,

739
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
corporations would never fucking let that happen.

740
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,520
And I can't remember in the video if he says that

741
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,520
he's only applying this to media and entertainment,

742
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
but to abolish copyright,

743
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
it's not just entertainment that has copyright.

744
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Everything has a copyright,

745
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
so you would alter all of society by abolishing copyright.

746
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
It's not as simple as, like, Edison.

747
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I think the real thing is that copyright protects ideas

748
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,520
for the end result of being able to profit off of them.

749
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
So instead of trying to end copyright,

750
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
just end the money thing.

751
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,520
End the incentive to have, like, legal copyright of a thing

752
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,520
so that you can just make whatever you want.

753
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
And you don't have to worry about making ends meet with it.

754
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Obviously, huge productions would still cost money,

755
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,520
like, I don't know, capitalism's behind it all.

756
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Oh, man, oh, god, this is...

757
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
There's so much, like, little things that are being said

758
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
that reminds me of what he says in this eight-hour video,

759
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
because I actually sat through and watched the whole thing,

760
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,520
because, I mean, I can already tell by the thumbnail

761
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
in just the eight hours that I'm not going to like this,

762
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
but I need to confirm that I don't like it,

763
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
so I watched the whole thing.

764
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Let's, like, set the stage, I guess.

765
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
So from what I understand,

766
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Unique Name of Service has made an eight-hour video

767
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,520
talking about the harassment of an artist who got into NFTs,

768
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,520
and they called out some people,

769
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
and it was eight hours long.

770
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I would say...

771
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
That's the thing we're talking about.

772
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Out of the eight hours,

773
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,520
like, really, the video had no reason to be eight hours.

774
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Yeah, you couldn't possibly have the eight hours of information in there.

775
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I could maybe, like, I could maybe, like,

776
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
maybe at the most say, like, it could have been two hours,

777
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
fucking been, like, 30 minutes.

778
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,520
They're going to call me a hypocrite when my eight-hour long video comes out,

779
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,520
when my eight-hour video, in which I talk about how much I was bullied,

780
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,520
that's what my video is about, spoiler.

781
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Worse, he would call you a lefty,

782
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
because, like, there's, like, a section,

783
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,520
there's, like, a section in the last two minutes

784
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,520
where he, like, points out that, like, he's like,

785
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
I noticed that a lot of anti-NFT people

786
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
hate capitalism and are lefties.

787
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
That's so weird.

788
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
That is so weird. That's so fucking weird.

789
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
What does it mean? What does it mean, though?

790
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Clearly, there's an agenda.

791
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
There's an agenda. Oh, my God.

792
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
There's a fucking lefty agenda.

793
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Man, did you see that Biden speech?

794
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Mmm, was a little bit political for my taste.

795
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Ben, you're unironic. You unironically sound like he did,

796
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
in the fucking, in that part of the video.

797
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
What a twat. What a cut.

798
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,520
He was, like, he was saying it, like, he was saying it,

799
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
like, lefties was, like, a dirty word or something,

800
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
like, you guys, I don't, I don't want to make this claim, guys.

801
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
I don't want to get political. What a dummy.

802
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I don't want to get political, but, like,

803
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
all these, like, anti-NFT people just lefties,

804
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,520
and then, and oh, my God, he fucking, a big,

805
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
the whole, the whole section where, like,

806
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
I know in the thumbnail it says, like,

807
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
oh, they didn't even care when she disappeared,

808
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
like, making it seem like something terrible

809
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
happened to her.

810
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
When we have no idea what happened to her in those four months,

811
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
he doesn't even fucking know.

812
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
He just says she was gone for four months.

813
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
She just stopped posting.

814
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
She just stopped posting.

815
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
And that's the, and that's the, the tragedy

816
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
that was supposed to be our hook.

817
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
First of all, is the video, like,

818
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
mostly about her specifically?

819
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
No, no, the vid, she, he only talks about her

820
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
for, like, maybe 30 minutes.

821
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
And it's nothing even, nothing has occurred.

822
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Nothing happened.

823
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm, I'm still confused as to what, like,

824
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
what the rest of the video is?

825
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Well, not just that, but, like, what is the point?

826
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Like, what, what, what was he getting at?

827
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
I mean, the, the ultimate point is,

828
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
NFT's good.

829
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
And the argument for that-

830
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Is that really?

831
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,520
The argument for that is people bullied this NFT artist

832
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
and it was mean of them to do that.

833
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Yes.

834
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Yum.

835
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,520
So, it's the, the start of the video kind of, like,

836
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,520
talks about how, like, one thing that's super annoying is,

837
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,520
so if you notice that the title of the video is

838
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
how Twitter backstabbed the artist.

839
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Right.

840
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
And, and the way he talks about Twitter,

841
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
you would think Twitter's a person.

842
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Yes.

843
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,520
He's already like a, like a stupid, like a dumb-

844
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
He's talking about, by Twitter, he means, like,

845
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
the people on Twitter.

846
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
He's talking about, yes.

847
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
And he, and he's specifically talking about the

848
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Twitter art community.

849
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Yes.

850
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
And he starts the video by saying, like, yeah,

851
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
you know, I used to, you know, I used to be kind of

852
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
involved in the art community because, you know,

853
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
I am, I have a guy who's working on my

854
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,520
pirate comic that no one wants to fucking read.

855
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
And-

856
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Okay.

857
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
And, and he started-

858
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Sure, whatever.

859
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
I noticed that on art Twitter,

860
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
the community is always helpful.

861
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
They're always like passing information to

862
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
helping out each other.

863
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
But then when NFT dropped, everyone turned

864
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
to evil and everyone started to attack

865
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
each other.

866
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Everyone turned to evil.

867
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Yeah.

868
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Yeah.

869
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
And that, and that's when they started

870
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
backstabbing.

871
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
That's when the backstabbing started.

872
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Absolutely.

873
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
When, and, and he, and he has a beef.

874
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
He has like a, he has some couple of gears

875
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
to grind against Dan Olson.

876
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
And it's like two hour line go up.

877
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
No kidding.

878
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
No kidding.

879
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Yeah.

880
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah.

881
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Yeah.

882
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Okay.

883
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I'll see if they have a point.

884
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
They, they, there's people in the comments

885
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
saying this is the part where they talk

886
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
about Dan Olson.

887
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I go to their bit and their first point

888
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
doesn't make sense.

889
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
And so I'm like, okay, well this,

890
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
I don't need to watch the rest.

891
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
What, do you remember what the point was?

892
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I can't remember.

893
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I can't remember exactly what it was,

894
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
but it was just sort of like a false

895
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
equivalence of some kind.

896
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Like saying Dan Olson was a liar because

897
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
two things that are not mutually exclusive

898
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
were said by Dan Olson.

899
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I see, I see.

900
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
There's a, there's a couple of times where he's

901
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
like comparing tweets and he's like making

902
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
it seem like, oh Twitter's hypocritical

903
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
because I see these two popular tweets

904
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
and it's all like, you know, like,

905
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
two different people.

906
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
They don't, two different people and also

907
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
they don't contradict each other.

908
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I see.

909
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Right.

910
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Because he thinks that if you're,

911
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
he thinks that if you're pro commission

912
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
but anti NFT, you're a hypocrite

913
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
for some reason.

914
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Of course.

915
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,520
That's really, what?

916
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I mean, honestly, that's a little

917
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
shocking.

918
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
I've never heard people say that.

919
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Oh my God.

920
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Every time he mentions commissions in the

921
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
video, he scoffs.

922
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Like if someone suggests commissions,

923
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
he's like, he's like, okay.

924
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
He even calls it, I think, like, like

925
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
slave labor at one point.

926
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Like doing commissions.

927
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Wait.

928
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
So it's, it's, it's not just a,

929
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
a defensive NFT.

930
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
It's an alternative ways.

931
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Okay.

932
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
That's weird.

933
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
You know, he's, he's shitting on like

934
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,520
relying on a system that has been

935
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
helping a lot of artists, even artists

936
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,520
like under 2000 followers on like

937
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Twitter could make, could make

938
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
steady income with commissions.

939
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
And I, yeah.

940
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,520
And, and also he like, it's, and I,

941
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
I think because ultimately he's so

942
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
hung up on Dan Olson, Dan Olson.

943
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I need to double check if this is

944
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
actually what he said word for word.

945
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
But he claims that Dan Olson said that

946
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
NFT doesn't help no small artists.

947
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Like it, and a unique name,

948
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,520
a source like interpret this as like

949
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
it literally, there's literally no

950
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
small artists on the planet ever.

951
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm pretty sure.

952
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I'm pretty sure he Dan did not say

953
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
if nobody, like no small artists has

954
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
ever made any money on an NFT.

955
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,520
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't say something

956
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
like that.

957
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
In the bit that I looked at,

958
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
like they, they pull a clip from

959
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Dan Olson's video, like two clips where

960
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,520
he says that, um, like while

961
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,520
people have profited from it, um,

962
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
like, and then there's another clip

963
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
where he says it doesn't help artists.

964
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
And I think that's what like the,

965
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
he's saying that's a contradiction.

966
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Therefore he's lying.

967
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
It's what they call it.

968
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Like he pulls a clip saying that

969
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Dan Olson acknowledges that,

970
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
that's that like people have made

971
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
money off it.

972
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Right.

973
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Gotcha.

974
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Yeah.

975
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
The, the specific thing that he's

976
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
referring to is that like Dan Olson

977
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
said that like, um, a lot of art

978
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
thieves, art thieves could potentially

979
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
make a profit with NFT.

980
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Yeah.

981
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
And then, and then Dan Olson later

982
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
says that like, oh,

983
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
small artists can't profit from NFT.

984
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
And he's like, this is a contradiction

985
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
because like suddenly thieves

986
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
contradiction like small artists.

987
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Right.

988
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Which like, he doesn't,

989
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
does he not consider that like a

990
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
couple of things, like preventing

991
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
a smaller artist from profiting the

992
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
NFT compared to a thief is that

993
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
the artist has to make the art

994
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
and that takes time.

995
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Right.

996
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
And, and no matter how fast the

997
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
artist you are, you can never.

998
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
This reminds me.

999
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
The speed of a thief who just goes

1000
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
around, finds something cool and

1001
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
that makes it into NFT.

1002
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Oh, this reminds me of, um,

1003
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
that video that I mentioned a couple

1004
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
of episodes ago, uh, Dark Viper

1005
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
AU's video about how

1006
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
reaction content is basically

1007
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
wage theft in that it is

1008
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
pretty much just monetizing other

1009
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
people's work and, and, and

1010
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
aggregating it.

1011
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Uh, yeah.

1012
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Like the, the, the, the reactor

1013
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
does not have to put any effort

1014
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
into make the content.

1015
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
They just profit by presenting

1016
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
it in this fashion.

1017
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Same with an NFT art

1018
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
thief.

1019
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
They don't, yeah.

1020
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
The artist has to make the art

1021
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
and that and mint it.

1022
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
So that's an additional cost that

1023
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
the thief doesn't, doesn't have

1024
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
to put into the system

1025
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
to engage with it.

1026
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Um, I have not seen, yeah,

1027
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
I haven't seen any of the video

1028
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
by the way, except for the clip

1029
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
that you posted of him talking

1030
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
about, uh,

1031
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Oh, Freddie, Freddie River Ross.

1032
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
She's like, she's lucky.

1033
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
She's, you're lucky that she

1034
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
came back when she did, or you

1035
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
would be in big trouble, Mr.

1036
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I have a clip that would end

1037
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
your career and mine.

1038
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm going to burn the whole

1039
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
system down.

1040
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Uh, or whatever it was.

1041
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Yeah.

1042
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Is it like a DM there?

1043
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
I don't, I don't.

1044
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Did he get into any info about

1045
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
that?

1046
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
He said he, he said he had some

1047
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
video that would

1048
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
incriminate someone and then

1049
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
when pressed about it, he said,

1050
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
no, I was just talking about

1051
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
an earlier cut of the video that

1052
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
I changed because it was too

1053
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
harsh.

1054
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
So he was going to be even

1055
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
meaner and that would have

1056
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
destroyed rubber Ross's career

1057
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
and his own.

1058
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
And his own.

1059
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
And his own.

1060
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
And his own.

1061
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
And his own pizza.

1062
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Yes.

1063
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
He would have, he would have

1064
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
like ranted so hard against

1065
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
them that their career would

1066
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
just like show.

1067
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
The video was going to be

1068
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
nine hours long and that would

1069
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,520
have literally killed them.

1070
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
But he decided to hold back.

1071
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Spent a whole hour just

1072
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
shitting on rubber Ross and

1073
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
pan pizza.

1074
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Is, is the implication, is the

1075
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
implication that they would

1076
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
have said, fuck you.

1077
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Not that they have more evidence

1078
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
that they're withholding, but

1079
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
that they would have been

1080
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,520
nastier.

1081
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I think in their video.

1082
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
It's, I don't.

1083
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
It's hard to tell.

1084
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Because it's a weird.

1085
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
He words the fret so weirdly

1086
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
because.

1087
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
When I first watched it, I

1088
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
thought he meant that, oh, he

1089
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
has like maybe some sort of

1090
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
video evidence of some.

1091
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
He has like the Epstein flight

1092
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
logs of YouTubers or something

1093
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
against.

1094
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Yeah.

1095
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
And he's about to destroy all

1096
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
three of them, but then

1097
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
re listening to it.

1098
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I'm kind of like, wait, no, it

1099
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
sounds like he's saying

1100
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
that he's going to, he's going

1101
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
to rant about them and he's

1102
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
going to put this rant on

1103
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
every one of his videos at the

1104
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
end.

1105
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
So people are always reminded

1106
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
that like.

1107
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
That's like, that's his log

1108
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
offline.

1109
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
It's like, and hey, thanks

1110
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
for, thanks for watching the

1111
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
new video.

1112
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Shout out to my five dollar

1113
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
patrons.

1114
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
So and so such and such and

1115
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
watch his name.

1116
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
And remember, rubber Ross and

1117
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
pan pizza bullied an NFT

1118
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
artist and just suicide on

1119
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
August of 2020.

1120
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
2022.

1121
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Okay.

1122
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Thanks for watching.

1123
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
See you in the next video.

1124
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
That was the plan.

1125
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Good, good, good.

1126
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
And you know what's another

1127
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
fucking thing that he says that

1128
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
that earlier in the video, he

1129
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
says that he doesn't believe

1130
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
that like, like these

1131
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
celebs or influencers are

1132
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
responsible for what their

1133
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
fans do.

1134
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Okay.

1135
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
But he, but he, he tries to

1136
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
kind of like make

1137
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
what rubber Ross and pan pizza

1138
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
did as like the exception to

1139
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
that rule because like, well,

1140
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
you see, you see, I get it.

1141
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
If I get it, if you're like a

1142
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
smaller person and you're

1143
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
shitting on a bigger person and

1144
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
that bigger person brings their

1145
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
fandom, that makes sense.

1146
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
But um, several like literally

1147
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
was just mining her own business

1148
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
and then pan peaks and rubber

1149
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Ross accused her of being a

1150
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
thief.

1151
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
And it's like your, your logic

1152
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
like it's still a bias to like

1153
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
they, they called her a thief,

1154
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
but they didn't fucking say to

1155
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
like everyone make sure she

1156
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
kills herself.

1157
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
I did.

1158
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Yeah, I did see.

1159
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
So Ross did call her a thief

1160
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
or accused her of stealing

1161
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
designs, right?

1162
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Or of stealing somebody else's

1163
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
like character designs or

1164
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
something like that.

1165
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Yeah, yeah.

1166
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Yeah, but that was, that seemed

1167
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
dumb.

1168
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Like that seemed like it was not

1169
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
the case.

1170
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
I, I like it, it, it's a very

1171
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
generic looking character to be

1172
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
honest.

1173
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Yeah.

1174
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Although I'll admit it and like

1175
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
if you in the follow video if

1176
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
unique name of source wants to

1177
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
clip this, I'll admit it.

1178
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,520
Like I don't give a fuck.

1179
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
I don't care.

1180
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
I retweeted, I retweeted the pan

1181
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,520
like, um, claiming that it was

1182
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
an RFP thing.

1183
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
I don't give a shit.

1184
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
So it wasn't, it wasn't.

1185
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
So they said it was our theft

1186
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
and it wasn't though.

1187
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
It wasn't our feather.

1188
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Just that two people drew the

1189
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
same generic like water based

1190
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
girl looking character.

1191
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Right.

1192
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Right.

1193
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
Um, and yeah, Ross was like,

1194
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Ross was like, uh, oh, she's,

1195
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,520
she's drawing so and so's

1196
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
character because this other

1197
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
character, this other person

1198
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
had a character who's a girl

1199
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
with, with water for hair.

1200
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I think of the name of the

1201
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
artist.

1202
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I have a girl who has water

1203
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
for hair.

1204
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Do you?

1205
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Yeah, but you gotta stop

1206
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
stealing.

1207
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
It's my mermaid.

1208
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
Yeah.

1209
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Stop stealing right now.

1210
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah.

1211
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I will steal.

1212
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Look, great artist steal.

1213
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
The best artist admitted on,

1214
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
on the podcast.

1215
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Great artist steal and even

1216
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,520
better artists make NFTs.

1217
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Right there.

1218
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Um, where were we?

1219
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
There's like a, um, there's

1220
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
this whole section at the

1221
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
beginning where like, like I

1222
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,520
said earlier, you get super

1223
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
hanged up on, on Daniels and

1224
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
saying like NFTs, like doesn't

1225
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
help any small artists.

1226
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
It's not like, um, oh yeah.

1227
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Well, I did a quick search and

1228
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
I found 25 small artists that

1229
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
were successful with NFTs.

1230
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Oh my God.

1231
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
That's what a fucking tweet.

1232
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
It's, it's stupid.

1233
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
I feel personally, I feel

1234
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
personally aggrieved by him.

1235
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
My, my, my, my, my, my hate is,

1236
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
my hate is personal to him.

1237
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
This is not about the issues

1238
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
anymore.

1239
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I just want to, I just want to

1240
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
punch him.

1241
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
It's not even, it's, it's not

1242
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
even 25 artists.

1243
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
It's 24 artists.

1244
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
One of them I don't count

1245
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,520
because it's a, it's an AI

1246
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
artist.

1247
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
Oh yeah.

1248
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
So it's like.

1249
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Oh God.

1250
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
That's a whole other can of

1251
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
worms then.

1252
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
So a person types in a thing,

1253
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
they get an image and they

1254
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
NFT mint it.

1255
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,520
Yes.

1256
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
And they're making money.

1257
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Yes.

1258
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Stupid.

1259
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Well.

1260
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Whatever.

1261
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Yeah.

1262
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
It's so.

1263
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
Good for them.

1264
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Yes.

1265
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
So he's, and the thing is that

1266
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
like you need to, and here's

1267
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
here's the thing.

1268
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
All of Unique's video is just

1269
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
anecdotes.

1270
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
There's like no like real, the

1271
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
only part where he like talks

1272
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,520
about statistics is when he

1273
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
talks about the environmental

1274
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
damage of like NFTs is like when

1275
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
he only actually brings up any

1276
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
like real statistics.

1277
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Yeah.

1278
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
But I feel like the conversation

1279
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
has generally moved past that

1280
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
aspect of it.

1281
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
That's not really what people

1282
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
are mad about anymore.

1283
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Yeah.

1284
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Because like it, like he brings

1285
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
up the chart that's like, sure,

1286
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
like bitcoins are like make as

1287
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
much waste as much energy as a

1288
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,520
small country.

1289
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
But like technically speaking,

1290
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,520
AC's waste more energy.

1291
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,520
Sure.

1292
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
That being said.

1293
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Yeah.

1294
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
AC's make you cool.

1295
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah.

1296
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
Yeah.

1297
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Yeah.

1298
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
Like Bitcoin is like volatile.

1299
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
And if we want to go that far,

1300
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,520
I mean like heating, you know,

1301
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
in general, heating apparatus,

1302
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
apparatuses spend even more

1303
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,520
energy than air conditioners.

1304
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
So, you know, the fact that

1305
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
people aren't freezing to death

1306
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
is even more of a problem.

1307
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,520
He really is trying to like,

1308
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
he brings up all these arguments

1309
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
trying to like make NFTs seem

1310
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
like something that's happening,

1311
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
like comparing it to something to

1312
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
make it seem a little bit like

1313
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
less of a shit show.

1314
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,520
Like he's like, oh,

1315
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
NFT collectors, they're kind of

1316
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
like, they're kind of like Hype

1317
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Beast.

1318
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Do you guys know what Hype Beast

1319
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,520
are?

1320
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Not really.

1321
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
Person who hypes stuff up.

1322
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
They're the, they're the guys who

1323
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
buy like the Supreme Merch,

1324
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
like they wait in lines and they

1325
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,520
buy like all the expensive shoes.

1326
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Are they just, are they just

1327
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,520
fencers?

1328
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Like they buy, buy shit up and

1329
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
then resell it?

1330
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
No, no, it's more like a cloud

1331
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
thing.

1332
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Like, oh yeah, I have the news

1333
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,520
Supreme.

1334
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,520
Yeah, I mean, I've heard,

1335
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I've heard the argument like a

1336
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
hundred times, like people will

1337
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,520
buy, um, they will value

1338
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
things, however they determine

1339
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
its value that, you know, like

1340
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
value doesn't really exist.

1341
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
And so NFT artists can

1342
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
successfully hoodwink people

1343
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
into paying larger amount of

1344
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
money for nothing.

1345
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Right.

1346
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
And I'm like, okay, you can

1347
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
make money off of it.

1348
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
I understand.

1349
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
Yeah.

1350
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,520
I hate it though.

1351
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
It sucks.

1352
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,520
So much.

1353
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,520
You're making money the same

1354
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,520
way you technically make money

1355
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
by gambling.

1356
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
And that's not.

1357
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,520
Yeah.

1358
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Yeah.

1359
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
And the thing is that like.

1360
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,520
It's not productive.

1361
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,520
The one thing, it's, we should,

1362
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
we should be able to agree that

1363
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
it's not productive.

1364
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Yes.

1365
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
And like on our, on our arm.

1366
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,520
It's definitely not the way

1367
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
forward.

1368
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
It's just a thing you can do.

1369
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
To be productive.

1370
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
But it's, it's, it's the most

1371
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
like stupid.

1372
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,520
It's the most like, like grimy

1373
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,520
disgusting capitalistic way to

1374
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,520
get it by.

1375
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,520
I don't.

1376
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,520
I don't.

1377
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't just like,

1378
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,520
I don't begrudge anyone making

1379
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,520
a living.

1380
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,520
I don't begrudge anyone making

1381
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
a living.

1382
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
And if someone's like,

1383
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,520
No.

1384
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,520
to make money and they do it

1385
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,520
by NFTs, like I think that's

1386
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
not the best way to do it.

1387
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
But if that's what it takes to

1388
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
do it, like it's like, I'm not

1389
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
mad about it.

1390
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
Yeah.

1391
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
I just think that like, it's

1392
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
not the future.

1393
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
And it certainly,

1394
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
certainly isn't a future we

1395
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
would want to like push for

1396
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
because it's so much.

1397
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
It's just the, the system we

1398
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
have now, but worse in various

1399
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,520
ways.

1400
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
I would argue.

1401
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,520
That's it.

1402
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
I would argue NFTs, like

1403
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
evidence that like the future

1404
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
looks fucking bleak and shitty.

1405
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Yeah.

1406
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
And um, yeah, if they became,

1407
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
if they became mainstream,

1408
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,520
yeah, it would be, it was,

1409
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
if the future would be worse

1410
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
for it.

1411
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Another kind of egregious

1412
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
thing is that like, he doesn't

1413
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
like, um, if you guys heard

1414
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
about this, his hashtag, it was

1415
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
like, I'm at the start of the

1416
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
year, I think called the, the

1417
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,520
animation new deal thing where

1418
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,520
they were trying to like,

1419
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
yeah, unionize the majority

1420
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
of animation studios.

1421
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
I saw it.

1422
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Yes.

1423
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Yeah.

1424
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
He, he frames this as people

1425
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
who are like pro that, but

1426
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
our anti NFTs are also

1427
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
hypocrites.

1428
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Like, like if you're pro

1429
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
anything, if you're pro, like

1430
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
anything that helps artists,

1431
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,520
but NFTs, you are by the

1432
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,520
fault of hypocrite.

1433
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
I get you.

1434
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Because you can make money,

1435
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
but you can make money.

1436
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
But you could, but you could

1437
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
like, like Dan also said,

1438
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
you couldn't make money, but

1439
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,520
um, I found 24 people that

1440
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
made money.

1441
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
So, um, Dan also,

1442
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
what did Dan, what did Dan

1443
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
say?

1444
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,520
He, there's that part where he

1445
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,520
says, um, like, you know, the

1446
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
reaction is confusion.

1447
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
Like, you know, we don't, you

1448
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
want to make money?

1449
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Like we're here to make money

1450
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
on NFTs.

1451
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,520
Don't you want to make money?

1452
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,520
Like what's, what's the

1453
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
problem?

1454
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
I was going to mention this

1455
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
earlier.

1456
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
There, there's really no point

1457
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
of like bringing up like 24

1458
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
artists that made money off

1459
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,520
NFTs.

1460
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,520
He could have brought up like

1461
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
a thousand small artists who

1462
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
also made money.

1463
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
It doesn't matter because he

1464
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
doesn't have nothing.

1465
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
He has nothing to compare it

1466
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
to.

1467
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,520
He doesn't bring it up like

1468
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
okay, now bring up all the

1469
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,520
small artists.

1470
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
It didn't help.

1471
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Let's see if it really does

1472
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
help small artists.

1473
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Right.

1474
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
Because it could be, oh, it

1475
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
could be, it is literally like

1476
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
going to a casino and finding

1477
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
the couple of guys who won at

1478
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Blackjack and being like, look,

1479
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
see, the casino helps people.

1480
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
People will make money.

1481
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Dan also claims that you can't

1482
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
make money at a casino, but I

1483
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
found five bald guys that

1484
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,520
helped.

1485
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
So, um,

1486
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Five bald guys?

1487
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,520
I found five.

1488
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,520
Sure.

1489
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
I just added a random attribute

1490
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,520
to these guys.

1491
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,520
Okay, sure.

1492
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,520
No, I think it's bald.

1493
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,520
That's fine.

1494
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
That's fine.

1495
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
I found 30, I found 30

1496
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
querked up white boys who have

1497
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
made plenty of cash off

1498
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,520
casinos.

1499
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,520
But it doesn't, like you can,

1500
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,520
yeah, you can make money, but

1501
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
can you fucking make a living

1502
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
if the currency is supposed to

1503
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
be volatile?

1504
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,520
It's going to be smarter to

1505
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,520
rely on a currency that isn't

1506
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,520
fucking always rising up and

1507
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,520
down and constantly fucking

1508
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
crashing.

1509
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
Yeah.

1510
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Yeah.

1511
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
And there's that side of it

1512
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
where it's like, it's a gamble

1513
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
to get into for the artist.

1514
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,520
Like you're not necessarily

1515
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,520
going to make a lot of money

1516
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
and there is a cost to put an

1517
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,520
NFT, like mint one.

1518
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
So like you're putting down

1519
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
monies on the off chance that

1520
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,520
somebody in your audience will

1521
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
like NFTs and buy it.

1522
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
But there's also the,

1523
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,520
the, the scam aspect of like,

1524
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,520
you have to try to sell the

1525
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,520
idea of NFTs to people so that

1526
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,520
they will buy it.

1527
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
And so you will just naturally

1528
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
not talk about the negative

1529
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,520
stuff.

1530
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,520
And you will scam people into

1531
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
getting into it.

1532
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
And it's just, it's like,

1533
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
it's like, I don't know, like

1534
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
your odds of winning at the

1535
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
casino, if you like pyramid

1536
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,520
scheme people to come to the

1537
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
casino, your odds will improve.

1538
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
And so naturally that's going

1539
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
to happen.

1540
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
And it's all, it's just so

1541
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
disgusting.

1542
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Yeah.

1543
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
There's so many victims.

1544
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,520
It's like, there's so obviously

1545
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
a bad thing generally.

1546
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah.

1547
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
It's free.

1548
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,520
It's pretty myopic.

1549
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,520
It's pretty myopic to just be

1550
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,520
like, well, some people

1551
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
succeeded.

1552
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
So it's good.

1553
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
There's this also this whole

1554
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
section he dedicates to like,

1555
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,520
does he, okay, I'm sorry, does

1556
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
he have a personal stake?

1557
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,520
Like, is he doing NFT stuff?

1558
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Is he planning on doing NFT stuff?

1559
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
He must have a personal

1560
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,520
stake.

1561
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
He said, he said if this video

1562
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
ruins his like YouTube career,

1563
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
he is, he's going to start doing

1564
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,520
NFTs.

1565
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Oh, so you better not.

1566
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
So you better like the video or else

1567
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,520
there'll be, he'll make even more NFTs.

1568
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,520
He'll, he'll hurt the environment

1569
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
even more.

1570
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Oh, what a bitch.

1571
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
What a fucking bitch.

1572
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
What a piece of shit.

1573
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
I hate him.

1574
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,520
You need, please make all your videos

1575
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
into NFTs.

1576
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
Please.

1577
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
I want you to make all your fucking videos.

1578
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
What did I say?

1579
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,520
I like mint every individual frame

1580
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
of every video, mint, you know,

1581
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
every, every down to the frame time

1582
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,520
stamp of every video, you can make

1583
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,520
billions and billions of NFTs and sell

1584
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
each one for a dollar.

1585
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
At the, at the end of the video,

1586
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
I'm jumping around because

1587
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
like conversations

1588
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
reminded me of so many like random

1589
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
shit this guy.

1590
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
Not random, but so the

1591
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
conversation is reminding me of like

1592
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
different points in the video.

1593
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
But at the end of the video, he

1594
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
talks about the author for

1595
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
Berserk and like his death and like

1596
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
how like he knows he didn't work

1597
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
himself to death and it was just like,

1598
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
it was like a heart condition that

1599
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
got him.

1600
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,520
But he said that like, let's say there

1601
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
is a manga artist and

1602
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
who is in a shitty situation like

1603
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
that?

1604
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
And he scoffs the idea

1605
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
of like, okay, maybe

1606
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,520
you could improve working conditions.

1607
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Maybe I don't really agree

1608
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,520
with like, like unions, you know,

1609
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,520
or, or, or, or let me,

1610
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
the alternative.

1611
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Here's his like superior alternative

1612
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
is like, what if a

1613
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
mangaka minted every page

1614
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
of their manga?

1615
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
True, true.

1616
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
And, and like imagine

1617
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
how insane do you need to be

1618
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
to like acknowledge that there are

1619
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
things that can be done to improve

1620
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
the working conditions?

1621
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Wait, wait, wait.

1622
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
No, what if we don't do that?

1623
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,520
Let's see where he's going with it.

1624
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Let's see where he's going with it.

1625
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
You don't get it.

1626
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Imagine, imagine how much money

1627
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
you'd get if you have, if you,

1628
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,520
if you, if you were the owner

1629
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
of the, of the page where white

1630
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
beer says the one piece is real.

1631
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,520
Oh my God.

1632
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,520
And he has his dick out.

1633
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
And he has his dick out.

1634
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,520
Holy shit.

1635
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,520
That would be worth some money.

1636
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Oh my God.

1637
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
And then, and then Oda would have

1638
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,520
enough money to like relax.

1639
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,520
And it's like,

1640
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,520
I don't get the corp.

1641
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
He has enough money.

1642
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
It's true.

1643
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,520
Cause the thing is that like,

1644
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,520
the thing is like better working

1645
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
conditions assumes that by the fall.

1646
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
You don't need to fucking add again.

1647
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,520
If your, if your favorite mangaka

1648
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,520
works himself to death,

1649
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,520
Karoshis themselves to death,

1650
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
and they die, it's your fault.

1651
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
And you don't want to feel bad,

1652
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,520
do you?

1653
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
So you better buy their fricking NFT.

1654
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
Is there like any,

1655
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
I don't know too much about this,

1656
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,520
the hard condition thing,

1657
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,520
but is there any indication that

1658
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
Berserk was not popular enough to

1659
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
support him medically?

1660
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Like, is this a situation where

1661
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
NFTs would have made the difference?

1662
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
It's so all over the place

1663
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,520
because it's kind of like,

1664
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
okay, so let's say there was like,

1665
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
there was this one mangaka,

1666
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
there was this one mangaka recently

1667
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
got canceled,

1668
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
but it seemed like it had a small

1669
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
fandom, which was,

1670
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
it was like a red writing hood

1671
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
character,

1672
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
but she had like big titties

1673
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
and she was like super buff.

1674
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
Oh my God.

1675
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,520
And so,

1676
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
right, but it would,

1677
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
the thing is that that's the only

1678
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,520
thing people ever talked about.

1679
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,520
So I kind of already knew it was

1680
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
going to be shit.

1681
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Besides,

1682
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
besides that,

1683
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
I guess it's like,

1684
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
okay, so would NFTs help this guy?

1685
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Even,

1686
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
even if like the manga wasn't good,

1687
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
if you had enough money off of like

1688
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
the big tittie NFT,

1689
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,520
would it have made the manga

1690
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
keep on going?

1691
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Because that implies that like,

1692
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,520
like Sean and Joe has,

1693
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,520
keeps a percentage of the NFT,

1694
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
right?

1695
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Artists already,

1696
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
artists already basically do this.

1697
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Like a lot of artists do sell their

1698
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,520
original pages,

1699
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,520
as a,

1700
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,520
as a thing.

1701
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,520
They sell like copies of it too,

1702
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
and people like eat it up because

1703
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,520
it's like, you know,

1704
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,520
it's like physical and like,

1705
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
it looks just like it, you know?

1706
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,520
They sell,

1707
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
they sell the original animation

1708
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
cells from like,

1709
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,520
cartoons and stuff.

1710
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,520
And the thing is that,

1711
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,520
that's a thing that people do already.

1712
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,520
The thing is that's so crazy,

1713
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,520
and he never brings this up,

1714
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,520
is that the NFT is not the art.

1715
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,520
The NFT is a receipt really.

1716
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,520
The NFT is like a link.

1717
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
And he doesn't,

1718
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
he doesn't even acknowledge that?

1719
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,520
Yeah.

1720
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
He talked,

1721
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
he like,

1722
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
he doesn't really acknowledge that

1723
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
what you're buying,

1724
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
but he kind of,

1725
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
he kind of implies it.

1726
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,520
There's a whole section where like,

1727
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,520
so you know,

1728
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
his whole like anti copyright stance.

1729
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,520
Sort of.

1730
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,520
Yeah.

1731
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,520
I mean,

1732
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,520
we just,

1733
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,520
the little,

1734
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,520
his abolishment of copyright,

1735
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
he argues that,

1736
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,520
that doesn't contradict with his like

1737
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,520
pro NFT stance.

1738
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,520
Right.

1739
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,520
And the,

1740
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,520
and the thing is that I agree with him,

1741
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
that it doesn't,

1742
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
because the way he explains it,

1743
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,520
I'm like, okay,

1744
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,520
I get it.

1745
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
I get why like being pro NFT

1746
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
and being anti copyright doesn't

1747
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,520
contradict each other.

1748
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Yeah.

1749
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Because the thing is that like,

1750
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
his whole argument is that

1751
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
like he,

1752
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
he doesn't think bootlegs are bad.

1753
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,520
Like,

1754
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
if someone,

1755
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,520
if something gets bootleg,

1756
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
that means that like,

1757
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,520
there's like a,

1758
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,520
there's like a problem.

1759
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
Yeah.

1760
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,520
With the person who's providing

1761
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,520
the item in the market,

1762
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
right?

1763
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
So bootlegs should be allowed.

1764
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
That being said,

1765
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,520
you can't bootleg an NFT.

1766
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,520
Right.

1767
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Because an NFT isn't.

1768
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,520
The obvious,

1769
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,520
yeah.

1770
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Yeah.

1771
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
The,

1772
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
the obvious question is what if it was,

1773
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
okay,

1774
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
what about right-click save?

1775
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
Right.

1776
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Right.

1777
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,520
But the thing is,

1778
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,520
what's his answer to people

1779
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,520
right-click saving the NFT?

1780
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Well,

1781
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,520
well,

1782
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,520
well,

1783
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,520
first of all,

1784
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,520
he pulls a fucking giant cope

1785
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,520
where he's all like,

1786
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
by the way,

1787
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
no one was upset about right-click save.

1788
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
You know,

1789
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
we,

1790
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
we all knew it was a joke, guys.

1791
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,520
It's not a joke.

1792
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,520
We all knew it was a joke.

1793
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Cause I,

1794
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,520
cause I,

1795
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
cause I saved the image and I haven't.

1796
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Well,

1797
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,520
well,

1798
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
the thing is that I,

1799
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
I get,

1800
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I get it.

1801
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
I get what he means

1802
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
because right-click save,

1803
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
like no,

1804
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,520
the NF,

1805
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,520
you don't own the NFT

1806
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
if you save the image

1807
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
because the image and the NFT

1808
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
are two different things.

1809
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
Yes.

1810
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Yes.

1811
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
The NFT is the link.

1812
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
I'm with you so far.

1813
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Okay.

1814
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
The NFT is the link.

1815
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
So what,

1816
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
so what is the NFT guy?

1817
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
So what,

1818
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
so what are we,

1819
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
but what are we talking about?

1820
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,520
The NFT is just the idea of scarcity.

1821
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
It's just the idea of something being rare.

1822
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
And you can't,

1823
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
you can't copyright that.

1824
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
You can't bootleg that, right?

1825
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Yeah.

1826
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,520
But,

1827
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
but he doesn't realize,

1828
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
he doesn't realize that he made the,

1829
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
the value.

1830
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
So what's the value then?

1831
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
He is saying,

1832
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,520
he's basically saying by the fault

1833
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
that NFT is an art.

1834
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Right.

1835
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
That,

1836
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
that it's not,

1837
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,520
and it will never fucking be art.

1838
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Right.

1839
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,520
At all.

1840
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,520
I mean,

1841
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,520
he kind of made the argument

1842
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
that all this shit is like soulless really.

1843
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,520
Right.

1844
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
Because he wants to say that,

1845
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
like the NFT,

1846
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
like,

1847
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
like people who collect NFT

1848
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
are kind of like hype beasts.

1849
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
And hype beasts are like

1850
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
super fucking annoying things.

1851
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
They're super fucking annoying people.

1852
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,520
But I respect them a little bit more,

1853
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
because when you buy a supreme jacket,

1854
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
it serves a purpose besides it,

1855
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
just being a brand.

1856
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
You could wear a jacket when it's cold.

1857
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,520
Right.

1858
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Right.

1859
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,520
Yeah.

1860
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,520
But an NFT like,

1861
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
no, it's just,

1862
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
it's just something that potentially could be

1863
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
scarce or not.

1864
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,520
It's depending like,

1865
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
how the fucking,

1866
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,520
how much the point is like.

1867
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
There's literally,

1868
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,520
there's literally nothing to it other than

1869
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,520
that you can say you own it.

1870
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
Right.

1871
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,520
Everything that it is.

1872
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,520
And people,

1873
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,520
people will pay for that.

1874
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,520
Sure.

1875
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,520
But like buy,

1876
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
they're,

1877
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,520
they're paying for the fact that like,

1878
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,520
it's like unique only they could own it,

1879
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,520
but it's not the art.

1880
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,520
Right.

1881
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,520
And he,

1882
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,520
he talks,

1883
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
he brings up some guy who's like,

1884
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,520
like,

1885
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,520
oh,

1886
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
here's like a super nice collector who like

1887
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,520
buys NFTs and doesn't sell them,

1888
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,520
which I don't get.

1889
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Like,

1890
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
I don't get motherfuckers.

1891
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,520
What a sweetheart.

1892
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,520
Right.

1893
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,520
And,

1894
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
and like he,

1895
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
he says like,

1896
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
this guy,

1897
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
you know,

1898
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
he buys NFTs and even,

1899
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
even though when the market was crashing,

1900
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
he just likes the art.

1901
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
And it's like,

1902
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,520
yeah,

1903
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,520
but you just made the argument that the NFT isn't the art.

1904
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
So he's,

1905
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
he's virtue signaling.

1906
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
He's a fucking fake.

1907
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Right.

1908
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
So what,

1909
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
by the fault.

1910
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
So what is he,

1911
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
so what is he actually buying?

1912
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
Sure.

1913
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
Gotcha.

1914
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,520
I mean,

1915
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,520
I would prefer it.

1916
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Honestly,

1917
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,520
if it was like,

1918
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,520
if it was just like,

1919
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,520
you give money to an artist for like,

1920
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
I don't know,

1921
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
an imaginary piece of an imaginary pie,

1922
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,520
just to say,

1923
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,520
I support you.

1924
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,520
Like that's,

1925
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,520
that's,

1926
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,520
that's the hypothetical,

1927
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,520
most people who buy NFTs try to want to profit off of the idea

1928
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,520
that they could sell it on.

1929
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,520
There's,

1930
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,520
there's nothing about that guy.

1931
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Like that guy could just give those artists money.

1932
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,520
He could just do the actual,

1933
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,520
like give the money.

1934
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
You could just do that.

1935
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,520
And at the end of the day,

1936
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,520
he's not really collecting art.

1937
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,520
Sure,

1938
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
it appears on his fucking website,

1939
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
but there's like,

1940
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,520
think of all the people who we have,

1941
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
like me,

1942
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,520
for example,

1943
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,520
we used to have like USBs just filled with images that I would collect.

1944
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
Right.

1945
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
And to me,

1946
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
that kind of has a little bit more,

1947
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,520
it has a little bit more going than someone's like,

1948
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,520
I only collect this image because it's an investment at the end of the day.

1949
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
So,

1950
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,520
so what you're saying is that unique simply does not,

1951
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,520
he just equivocates between art and NFT,

1952
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
seemingly without,

1953
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,520
seemingly without any respect for the fact that they are not one in the same.

1954
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
But he are,

1955
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
he talks about them as though they are.

1956
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,520
Right.

1957
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
And this makes me think about like,

1958
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
cause as you mentioned earlier,

1959
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,520
like what's stopping the person from just giving the artist money.

1960
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,520
And it's like,

1961
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,520
people already do that.

1962
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,520
Like that's what Patreon is for,

1963
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
which by the way,

1964
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,520
he,

1965
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
he scoffs at Patreon too.

1966
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
He scoffs at literally everything that like helps,

1967
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
that could help an artist.

1968
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,520
Right.

1969
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Because he also frames like,

1970
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
he also frames that like,

1971
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,520
Oh yeah, you know what?

1972
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Patreon takes too big of a cut.

1973
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
And so does PayPal,

1974
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
you know,

1975
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
but the minting fees,

1976
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,520
the minting fees though,

1977
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
that's not,

1978
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
that doesn't take a cut.

1979
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
That's just the free market.

1980
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,520
That's just the free market.

1981
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,520
That's just the free market.

1982
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,520
You know,

1983
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
how like,

1984
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
how Bandcamp has like,

1985
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,520
people who,

1986
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,520
who supported an album or a song,

1987
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,520
they have their little username and icon underneath it.

1988
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
So supported by these people.

1989
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,520
That would be a nice,

1990
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
that you could do that.

1991
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
Like that's,

1992
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,520
if you want to support an artist by paying them

1993
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
and get a little like sticker saying,

1994
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,520
you did it,

1995
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,520
you own this,

1996
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
or you are,

1997
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
you know,

1998
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,520
you are a part of this,

1999
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
like,

2000
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
like support.

2001
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,520
That's the sort of thing that it should be.

2002
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,520
Like YouTubers do that with Patreon.

2003
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
Fucking unique does that.

2004
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,520
He does that at the end of this video.

2005
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Yeah.

2006
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
It's just like,

2007
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,520
if there's an argument to be made that NFTs are the way to do that,

2008
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,520
it's just not true.

2009
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,520
There's so many other ways

2010
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,520
that are already there for artists

2011
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,520
to be supported by fans

2012
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,520
who want to be a part of the thing.

2013
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,520
There's so many like,

2014
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,520
like ways to do it

2015
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,520
based on currency that isn't volatile.

2016
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,520
You know,

2017
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,520
that isn't like a huge gamble to get into.

2018
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Right?

2019
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,520
Yeah.

2020
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,520
It's,

2021
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
it's fucking,

2022
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
it's fucking,

2023
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,520
it's fucking trash.

2024
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
And

2025
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,520
I think,

2026
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,520
if I were to talk about like one more section about the video,

2027
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,520
that is just very like,

2028
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
dumb.

2029
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Is the last two hours,

2030
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,520
is the anti SJW section of the video?

2031
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,520
Because I mentioned earlier that like,

2032
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
he says lefty,

2033
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
like a bad word,

2034
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,520
like a bad word.

2035
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,520
And basically,

2036
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,520
like,

2037
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
unironically,

2038
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
like he doesn't state this,

2039
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
he's presenting things.

2040
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
It seems like he's implying that like,

2041
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,520
the NFT artists are like the black people

2042
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
of the art world,

2043
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
if you will,

2044
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,520
because they're just as oppressed

2045
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,520
as black people in real life.

2046
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,520
Well, they're,

2047
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
they're like oppressed by like lefties

2048
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,520
who are by the way,

2049
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
the real races.

2050
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,520
Right?

2051
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,520
I don't know why,

2052
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,520
but the unique name of Somers did not strike me

2053
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,520
as a right-leaning person.

2054
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,520
He says he's a pro-capitalist libertarian

2055
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
at the end of the video.

2056
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,520
Well.

2057
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,520
Right?

2058
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
He's one,

2059
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,520
he's one of the libertarians that have like one,

2060
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,520
he's like libertarian,

2061
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
but one of his like,

2062
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,520
takes is like a little bit more left.

2063
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Right?

2064
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,520
Yeah.

2065
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,520
He looks like,

2066
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,520
I'm going to get canceled.

2067
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,520
He looks like a gender person.

2068
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,520
He looks like he has pronouns.

2069
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
He looks, he does,

2070
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
honestly,

2071
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,520
and you know, it's true,

2072
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,520
he does look like he has pronouns.

2073
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,520
It looks like he's gonna,

2074
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,520
a little bit surprised.

2075
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,520
A little bit surprised.

2076
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,520
But I also,

2077
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
I could see it, I could see.

2078
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

2079
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

2080
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,520
If you,

2081
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,520
if you need,

2082
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,520
if you need name of sorts,

2083
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,520
gain some pronouns,

2084
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,520
I would respect them a little bit,

2085
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,520
actually.

2086
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,520
I'd be like,

2087
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
you know what,

2088
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,520
pronoun person,

2089
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,520
you know,

2090
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
you're all right.

2091
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,520
I would respect the pronouns,

2092
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
not the person.

2093
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Just like I do with everyone.

2094
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,520
Oh my God.

2095
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
And,

2096
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,520
he just kind of like,

2097
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,520
oh, and,

2098
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,520
I, this is,

2099
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,520
so, you know the real reason

2100
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,520
why this video is eight hours long?

2101
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,520
Cause he spends,

2102
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,520
he spends the majority of it

2103
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,520
reading tweets.

2104
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,520
Oh God,

2105
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,520
it's just like J.K. Rowling's new book.

2106
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,520
It's just like J.K. Rowling's new book

2107
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,520
of fake meme tweets.

2108
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,520
He,

2109
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,520
he spends so much fucking time

2110
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,520
in the video

2111
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
reading every single,

2112
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,520
and I'm not lying when I say

2113
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520
he reads every single

2114
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,520
negative tweet about NFT.

2115
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,520
While watching the video,

2116
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,520
I was trying to pay attention

2117
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,520
to see if he would

2118
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,520
read one of my,

2119
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,520
my tweets.

2120
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
Cause I left a couple of stuff

2121
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,520
that he,

2122
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
like in the same style of like

2123
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
tweets he's reading.

2124
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
And there's like so many,

2125
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,520
like I,

2126
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
I,

2127
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,520
I noticed there was a lot like

2128
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,520
of people,

2129
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,520
a lot of like my mutuals

2130
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
or other like people that I know

2131
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,520
that tweets he was reading

2132
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,520
off of,

2133
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,520
you know?

2134
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,520
And like,

2135
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,520
he wouldn't just read it.

2136
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,520
He would also read

2137
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,520
how many retweets

2138
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,520
and how many likes.

2139
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,520
There's like two moments

2140
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,520
where he says that like

2141
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,520
the NFT hate campaign

2142
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,520
is so bad.

2143
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,520
Because,

2144
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,520
one of his,

2145
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,520
two of his followers like

2146
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
ratioed him one time.

2147
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Which is like,

2148
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,520
this is like,

2149
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,520
why would he bring this up?

2150
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,520
What is,

2151
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
why do you bring a thing

2152
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
to get fucking ratioed

2153
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
by your own followers, dude?

2154
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,520
That's fucking cringe.

2155
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,520
That's very funny.

2156
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,520
That's the cringe you shit ever.

2157
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,520
And he fucking,

2158
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,520
and he complains about people

2159
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,520
like being like follow police,

2160
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
like,

2161
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
oh there's people out there

2162
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
who check to see if you follow

2163
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
NFT artists.

2164
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,520
But he's fucking being like,

2165
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,520
he's being like the,

2166
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
the Twitter like

2167
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Gestapo right now,

2168
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,520
like fucking,

2169
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,520
cause he like,

2170
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
when he talks about

2171
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,520
Robert Ross,

2172
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,520
it's not that he,

2173
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
the whole like framing it,

2174
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
that Robert Ross started

2175
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,520
like the hate campaign,

2176
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,520
but he also

2177
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,520
like goes to check to see,

2178
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,520
like,

2179
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,520
what are the tweets

2180
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
that Robert Ross likes?

2181
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,520
He only likes the anti-NFT tweets.

2182
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,520
He's just retweeting anti-NFT stuff.

2183
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
He's following the wrong people.

2184
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
He's liking the wrong things.

2185
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,520
Yes.

2186
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Oh, well,

2187
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
mutuals with Hasan,

2188
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,520
red flag right there.

2189
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, yeah.

2190
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
And that's like another

2191
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
fucking real point

2192
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
he brings up later.

2193
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
And Hasan is a lefty

2194
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
and the left has a problem

2195
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
because they bully NFT people.

2196
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Yeah.

2197
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,520
And I know that because Ross did it

2198
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,520
and Ross likes Hasan

2199
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,520
and Hasan is left

2200
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
and left is bad

2201
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,520
because Ross bullies

2202
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,520
NFT people.

2203
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
And I know that the left

2204
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,520
does that because

2205
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,520
Ross follows Hasan.

2206
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,520
You see,

2207
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,520
it all comes together.

2208
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,520
A big reason why

2209
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,520
like I wanted to finish the video

2210
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,520
because at the start of the video

2211
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,520
he mentions,

2212
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
he mentions an agenda

2213
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,520
and I was like,

2214
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
oh man,

2215
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,520
now I got to really know

2216
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,520
like who's the secret

2217
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,520
fucking anti-NFT illuminati

2218
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
he's talking about.

2219
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,520
Uh-huh.

2220
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,520
But he just reveals

2221
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,520
that it's like lefties.

2222
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,520
He even does like a montage

2223
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,520
of different like anti-NFT tweets

2224
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,520
mentioning capitalism.

2225
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,520
Uh-oh.

2226
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,520
And it's like...

2227
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,520
Scary.

2228
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Like it's like he,

2229
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,520
he doesn't realize that

2230
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
it is capital,

2231
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,520
like it is capitalism.

2232
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
It especially NFTs

2233
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,520
are very late stage capitalism

2234
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,520
because like,

2235
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
like capitalism would be like,

2236
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,520
you're trying to make as much profit

2237
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,520
off of like a physical object

2238
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,520
that like serves a purpose

2239
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,520
in a way, right?

2240
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,520
Right.

2241
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,520
And late stage capitalism would be

2242
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,520
like you're trying to make as much

2243
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,520
money off something

2244
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,520
that doesn't-

2245
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,520
No matter what it is,

2246
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,520
just make that money.

2247
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,520
Yeah.

2248
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,520
Like it does,

2249
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,520
it's not even like an object.

2250
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,520
It's like,

2251
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,520
it's just an idea of something.

2252
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,520
So what,

2253
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,520
does he,

2254
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,520
yeah,

2255
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,520
what does he think the difference

2256
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
between this and

2257
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,520
capital,

2258
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,520
I mean,

2259
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,520
he likes,

2260
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,520
first of all,

2261
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,520
he likes capitalism.

2262
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
He thinks it's good.

2263
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
So does,

2264
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,520
but he doesn't think the NFTs are

2265
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
a branch or a,

2266
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
what's the word,

2267
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
a manifestation of capitalism.

2268
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,520
Does he think it's better

2269
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,520
than capitalism?

2270
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,520
He might,

2271
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
he frames NFTs,

2272
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,520
some sort of like

2273
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
natural progressive

2274
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
progression

2275
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
Yeah.

2276
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,520
of like stuff that like

2277
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,520
already exists.

2278
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Yeah.

2279
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,520
That's the problem.

2280
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,520
It's a natural progression

2281
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,520
of a bad system

2282
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,520
that encourages bad things

2283
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
to happen.

2284
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,520
And there is,

2285
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,520
for it's bad.

2286
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Well,

2287
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,520
he sees them as

2288
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,520
inevitable.

2289
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,520
Yes.

2290
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,520
That's part of the inevitable

2291
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,520
march of progress.

2292
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,520
He's like,

2293
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
just part of the,

2294
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,520
the natural part of the market,

2295
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
you know,

2296
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
the free,

2297
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,520
the fucking free market.

2298
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,520
I have a feeling that like,

2299
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
tell me if you ever met

2300
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,520
this kind of person.

2301
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
There's like a,

2302
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
there's like people out there

2303
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,520
that are like pro capitalism,

2304
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,520
but they don't know

2305
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,520
what capitalism is.

2306
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
Like what they think

2307
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
capitalism is,

2308
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,520
is like when you buy

2309
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,520
and sell things.

2310
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,520
Yeah.

2311
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,520
Yes.

2312
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,520
And I,

2313
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,520
I had a buddy who I asked him,

2314
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,520
dude,

2315
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,520
because he was defending

2316
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,520
capitalism.

2317
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,520
Do you know what it is?

2318
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,520
And he's like,

2319
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,520
yeah, it's when you buy

2320
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,520
and sell things.

2321
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,520
And I'm like,

2322
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,520
no, that's not fucking

2323
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,520
capitalism.

2324
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,520
That's commerce.

2325
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,520
Yeah.

2326
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,520
There's mercantilism existed before.

2327
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Yeah.

2328
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Like just buying and selling shit.

2329
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
It's just,

2330
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,520
it's always fucking

2331
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,520
is the fucking the,

2332
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,520
the,

2333
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,520
uh,

2334
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,520
what do you call it?

2335
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,520
The incentive structure

2336
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
that leads to

2337
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,520
billionaires existing.

2338
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,520
The existence of an owning,

2339
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,520
an owning class,

2340
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,520
a class that owns the,

2341
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,520
the means of production,

2342
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,520
the bourgeoisie

2343
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,520
defined by,

2344
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,520
defined by their ownership.

2345
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
Yeah.

2346
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
And he's basically saying that

2347
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,520
like you see lefties,

2348
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,520
like would say stuff like,

2349
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
uplift,

2350
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
uh,

2351
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
black,

2352
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
black voices.

2353
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
But, but then like,

2354
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
I hate it when people do that.

2355
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
But,

2356
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
but then when like black people

2357
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
say like,

2358
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,520
when black people are anti-vaccine,

2359
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,520
fucking Hassan is like angry at them.

2360
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,520
And like,

2361
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,520
I'm going to say this,

2362
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
the only reason people call Hassan,

2363
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
the only reason people consider

2364
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,520
Turkish people white is

2365
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,520
because they hate Hassan.

2366
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,520
I'm going to say that right now.

2367
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,520
Wait,

2368
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,520
I know,

2369
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,520
I know Turkish people.

2370
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,520
So they're saying he's white,

2371
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,520
because they hate,

2372
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
okay, sure.

2373
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
Well, well,

2374
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
Turkish people are like,

2375
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
very light-skinned.

2376
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
From what I've seen,

2377
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,520
they seem very light-skinned.

2378
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,520
Um,

2379
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,520
I thought Turkey was more deserty,

2380
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
but like,

2381
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
what do I know?

2382
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Freaking, uh,

2383
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
Johnny Depp looks less white

2384
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
than Hassan does.

2385
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
Johnny Depp is more of a PO.

2386
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,520
I can't believe white woman,

2387
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
Amber heard,

2388
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
was frightening POC,

2389
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Johnny Depp,

2390
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,520
taking away his fucking job.

2391
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
True.

2392
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
His livelihood,

2393
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,520
threatening his livelihood.

2394
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,520
He, he,

2395
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,520
he basically does,

2396
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,520
he basically does the thing where like,

2397
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
um,

2398
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
throughout the whole video,

2399
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
he's saying that he's like,

2400
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
pro-nuance.

2401
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,520
Like he's,

2402
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,520
he's, he has the nuance.

2403
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,520
I consider myself

2404
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
pro-nuance.

2405
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
I'm pro-facts.

2406
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
I'm pro-the-truth.

2407
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
Yeah.

2408
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
And anyway,

2409
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,520
here's why,

2410
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,520
here's why NFTs are inevitable

2411
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,520
and why.

2412
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
Are better,

2413
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,520
better than unions.

2414
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,520
Here's why,

2415
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
here's why,

2416
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
uh,

2417
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
Amber heard is a white woman

2418
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,520
attacking a BIPOC Johnny Depp.

2419
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
Uh, anyway.

2420
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
Yeah.

2421
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,520
Okay.

2422
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,520
I also consider myself pro-nuance.

2423
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,520
He,

2424
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,520
he considers himself pro-nuance,

2425
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,520
but he does,

2426
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,520
he thinks that like,

2427
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,520
I'm pro-nouns.

2428
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,520
He,

2429
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
he thinks that lefties are hypocrites

2430
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,520
when they like,

2431
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,520
criticize bad ideas

2432
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,520
that come from like,

2433
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,520
POC.

2434
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,520
When,

2435
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,520
like,

2436
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
it's like,

2437
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,520
you understand that maybe there's some nuance here,

2438
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,520
that maybe,

2439
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
no,

2440
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
when a black person,

2441
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,520
like,

2442
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,520
he brings up a guy called Thomas,

2443
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,520
uh,

2444
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
I think his name is Thomas Soho.

2445
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
Oh, I know.

2446
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
He's like a,

2447
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
he's like a famous black, uh,

2448
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
economist, right?

2449
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah.

2450
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Yeah.

2451
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
Economist.

2452
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,520
And,

2453
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
and he,

2454
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,520
because he talks about,

2455
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,520
like,

2456
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
this is the part where he's just shitting on,

2457
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,520
like,

2458
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,520
lefties that he has.

2459
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,520
Like,

2460
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,520
he's not even like,

2461
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,520
talking about NFTs anymore.

2462
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
He's like,

2463
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,520
just shitting on lefties.

2464
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,520
Does he do a,

2465
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
does he do a,

2466
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
does he do a,

2467
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,520
does he do a,

2468
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,520
does he do a,

2469
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
and another thing,

2470
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,520
what if a black person made NFTs?

2471
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,520
Wouldn't it be racist

2472
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
to be mad about it?

2473
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Oh,

2474
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
you,

2475
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
oh,

2476
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,520
I'm just saying that like,

2477
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,520
the,

2478
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,180
the blackutta

2479
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,520
Republican's were more offensive than anything Hitler ever said about Jews,

2480
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
in my opinion,

2481
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,520
but replaced Jews with NFT artists.

2482
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,520
And,

2483
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,520
not surprisingly

2484
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
There's like,

2485
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
I'm not joking when I say this.

2486
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
There's the dream,

2487
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,520
there's the three minute section of the eight hour video where he's like defending Clarence Thomas.

2488
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,520
What?

2489
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
What the fuck!

2490
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
Yes.

2491
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
That's a good idea.

2492
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,520
He's one of the,

2493
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,520
he's the black guy on the Supreme court.

2494
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,520
He's one of the ones he voted in favor of repealing.

2495
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
Oh,

2496
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,520
that,

2497
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,400
That guy wait, what is he? I want to know what does he have to say about Clarence Thomas?

2498
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,240
Well, he doesn't like that a bunch of liberals called him like the n-word like

2499
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,080
You know what you know what I'll you know what I'll give it to him. You know what?

2500
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,720
I'm defending like I I mean I'm defending you're here to do you to officially defend click calling switch

2501
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,720
I switch sides now. Okay, but another

2502
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,360
I'm allowed to say am I allowed to say the C word

2503
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:05,240
Is it a color where no the seat C o and the word the word for a the word for a black person who?

2504
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,880
undermines other black people for

2505
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,800
No, I wouldn't say that Ben. You know, I probably I won't say it. I don't say

2506
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:19,200
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. See C o and the word that got that never knows best video about

2507
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,620
dragon age taken down because the

2508
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:27,840
Because because the Coon the the code of conduct

2509
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,960
Spelled Q you and sounded too much like the word Nick got flagged for eight speed

2510
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:38,440
Then you gotta need like you can't be saying that you haven't had like a black guest on this show for ten years

2511
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,120
I didn't I was I said the Q version

2512
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,400
I pronounced it with the short double O sound

2513
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,640
The difference between a cook and cook look I

2514
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,280
Silent hard are all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's right

2515
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:04,260
But the thing is that I cut this whole part. No, it's good. No, I'm pro nuance. This is new

2516
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,280
He conflates liberals with lefties, which is like big mistake right there

2517
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:14,560
Well, yeah, I mean everybody on the right does that everybody on the right doesn't understand that they're not the same thing

2518
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,080
I mean like the thing is that it's the same with him like conflating Twitter as a person

2519
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,680
Which is why no, that's the only way Twitter

2520
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,680
He's conflating NFTs with art as well

2521
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,600
Yes, very pro very pro nuanced position this guy has

2522
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,520
Yes, very good. Oh my god

2523
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:40,320
Okay, well, I think one one final thing one one fucking one fucking final thing and then we could move on from the unique

2524
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:47,520
The unique name of sore is shitty now or right? Um, he he complains, you know the artist. I'm RJ Palmer

2525
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,520
Yeah, the Bulbasaur guy. Yeah. Yeah, he did like the realistic Pokemon

2526
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,880
And then he ended up working on the technically true. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

2527
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,960
So, um, anyway, he he frames like RJ Palmer as kind of like a hypocrite because um,

2528
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:09,760
He did tweet out that like he's all like, hey guys, maybe like the massive harassment campaigns against like

2529
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:15,280
NFT artists is it like maybe we maybe like, you know, NFTs fucking suck

2530
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,080
But like maybe they don't deserve a difference. Yeah, I mean that seems fair

2531
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,920
I am not yeah, I'm not

2532
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,560
I'm not I don't I don't hate into individual small artists for doing what they do to make money

2533
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:37,040
I cannot begrudge them that I don't hate them. I mean, I don't hate like anyone who I don't hate any small artists who tried it

2534
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,800
And then like yeah, stop doing it. Yeah

2535
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,680
Especially become from a third world country because at that point fuck it right, right?

2536
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,440
Yeah, that that being said RJ Palmer made that tweet and then a bunch of people in the replies were like

2537
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,160
Nah, dude, fuck NFT artists, right? And the thing is that RJ Palmer had no pushback against us, right?

2538
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,880
Like he didn't like he didn't he didn't push back against the people saying nah, dude. Fuck that. Yeah

2539
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,760
He didn't push back any any frames is as like what the fuck RJ like you're fucking cultivating this like hate

2540
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,120
This hate because he because he said don't harass people

2541
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,280
But he didn't back it up hard enough. And so he actually said the opposite of what he said

2542
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,640
This is the weird thing there is awesome like like a a bit of an argument and

2543
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,400
An argument I shouldn't say a bit because it is that like people

2544
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:36,040
Go to harassment way too easily and way too hard and in large numbers as it often is with something like Twitter

2545
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,040
It's very damaging

2546
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:43,880
So like it's not good that people go on a harassment campaigns thinking that they're the only one doing it not realizing

2547
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:48,680
It was like huge amounts if it's like a big like all the Twitter enemy of the week

2548
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,800
I and somebody gets dogpiled and it's like that aspect of it is like it's something to discuss

2549
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,400
There's nuance in that you can't make a whole eight hour video about just that though

2550
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:04,200
He sure they didn't I think my problem is that he frames this as like an art Twitter problem

2551
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,120
Or like as a lefty problem when like it's a social media

2552
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,720
This is just a Twitter problem the thing is Twitter is designed to piss you off like that

2553
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,320
That's our purpose and he doesn't consider that

2554
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,960
There's so many things he just doesn't consider it because he comes into everything with bad faith like for example

2555
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:28,280
Though the one guy that supposedly like Sarah like stole art from like he clarified that he thinks that Sarah does not deserve

2556
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:33,400
The hate campaign and both pan pizza and Ross did not tweet the clarification tweet

2557
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:40,040
So he so he makes it seem like Ross is like this evil person for not doing that when he doesn't consider that maybe it

2558
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,440
Just didn't show up on Ross's fucking timeline

2559
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,880
Maybe like because Ross seems to be maybe only interacting with like hate hate NFT stuff

2560
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,160
So that shit didn't pop up right he doesn't consider that just what maybe they didn't fucking see it

2561
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,960
Maybe because a lot of big artists a lot of popular people will make a tweet and then mute it right away

2562
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:02,760
Because their phone is gonna be constantly fucking ringing from the notifications

2563
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,760
He does not consider none of these things

2564
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:10,480
Right because everything is like it like everything has like an intent and not that like it's just like

2565
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:18,640
This is a sad situation that the internet and Twitter and social media has brought us to where this happens too often and then too

2566
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,280
Easily it is not the malicious intent of anyone in particular

2567
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:29,500
So so he's mentioning anything. I mean, I know people who have large audiences should have like some

2568
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,220
Understanding that when they say stuff and their followers like

2569
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,880
Feel in power to do something that that might have some

2570
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,540
like repercussions

2571
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:45,060
But like I don't know. What did they even say that was so bad?

2572
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,620
Like how could they have done it different say nothing I?

2573
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,380
suppose

2574
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:58,380
Yeah, like I think I mean even like I think no matter what RJ Palmer would have done like unique name of service would have like

2575
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:04,500
Taken it as bad, right the fact that like RJ Palmer isn't pro NFT is a bad thing

2576
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,060
right

2577
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,260
Right, yeah, yeah

2578
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:15,300
Yeah, so so for example, he hates that RJ Palmer like didn't do enough to like stop the campaign

2579
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:22,940
But then later in the video he brings up that um that one black streamer that went into that like like the most racist town in the world

2580
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:28,220
And like was talking to the Klans member and that Klans member was just telling him just awful shit

2581
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,580
And he just let that slide

2582
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,500
But he was kind of and but he framed the frames is as like

2583
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:40,400
Cassana is an evil person for like criticizing that black guy who was letting this like Klans member say all his racist shit to him

2584
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:46,780
Hmm, which is like do you not realize that like I mean the thing is that I'm basically saying that like

2585
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,420
he's criticizing

2586
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:53,260
RJ Palmer for like not doing enough to stop a

2587
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,700
Harassment campaign, but he's not taking that same energy to like

2588
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:04,260
This like this individual not like saying anything back to like a Klans member saying a bunch of racist shit to him, right?

2589
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,500
right because

2590
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:11,280
That video standard, right exactly he has like this double like the thing is that like and

2591
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:17,980
This is kind of like a thing that like is very much pushed as an idea that lefties are like that lefties like

2592
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:24,980
Present themselves as this like perfect being when I say like the majority of like lefties don't do that like majority of them

2593
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:32,180
Like admit that their assholes and pieces of shit. I do that right like I'm like the untolerant left if you will right

2594
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,700
But but the thing is that they keep like pushing this idea

2595
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:41,980
So like anything like it like anything a lefty would do that's like considered negative or like push back against like a

2596
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,280
protective class or whatnot is them being that they're instant. They're like

2597
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,240
Participating and being a hypocrite, you know

2598
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,320
So right so it's like a lefty. Oh

2599
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,000
Lefties like things that are good, but in my opinion

2600
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
one of them is something bad, so

2601
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,400
It's so it's so weird because it's like it's like it's like you start starting from the point that like okay

2602
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,320
Anything anything a lefty likes is something good, right? But I hate them

2603
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:16,400
So let's so let's just but they're bad because not because they believe bad things or they want bad things

2604
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:23,600
But because they fell short of the good things that they say that they like and that I should probably agree with them

2605
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,040
about

2606
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:34,240
But I hate them for it. Yeah, so yeah, so to clarify the video did not it did it did not fucking need all eight hours

2607
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,440
Yeah, you repeat himself too much

2608
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,440
He's reading too much

2609
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,640
Pat had it out reads reading tweets. Yeah, right and like he did he said he did that

2610
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,520
He did six months of research to prepare for this video and I'm saying just on Twitter

2611
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:54,080
He should have done six more months because this shit is like fucking this, you know, this reminds me of that

2612
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,760
I wrote you a five page letter if I had more time it would have been one

2613
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:04,440
You know brevity is the soul of wit and I think if you maybe you should have worked harder

2614
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,560
Not to make the video longer what to make it shorter

2615
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,160
Where it won't be pat it's where it won't be a waste of time

2616
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,600
So I have to I gotta go somewhere like real quick right now. Are you guys gonna still be recorded in 30 minutes?

2617
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,480
minutes probably

2618
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,600
30 an hour and a half in well like if you guys aren't recording by the time I get back whatever but

2619
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,240
I mean you cut out this whole part or let's sink. Let's we didn't sink at the beginning

2620
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:39,640
Right now on the count of three say sink one two three sink. Thank all right

2621
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,520
We will probably still be going in half an hour. I think I

2622
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:50,760
Wanted to ask about that the the black guy going into the racist area because that seemed interesting

2623
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,300
Was that do you know what that is? Oh, no, I wasn't familiar with that

2624
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:01,240
Okay, I guess I'll wait until cheesy. Did he say it was a video of Hassan talking to a racist

2625
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,640
No, a black guy who got accosted by a racist guy or was that it was

2626
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:12,400
What I assume is that Hassan watched a video in which a black guy goes to the most racist town in America and walks up to

2627
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,880
Clans members, right seems like a bit that he's doing in that video. Yeah, and

2628
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,560
Hassan

2629
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,840
Criticized the black guy because of court like oh if you go there, of course something's gonna happen

2630
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:30,440
And you need to do that for us criticize Hassan right? Okay, and but he didn't criticize the black guy for

2631
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:37,480
Jumping into a lion's den I suppose. Mmm. I would like to see that video. That seems interesting. That seems like a weird bit

2632
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,800
It is a weird bit. Yeah, I I'm not

2633
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,560
Yeah, I don't know I have to see it. Oh man. I just shit

2634
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:51,140
I just remembered a bunch of stuff that I did last night that I forgot about you. Oh do tell do tell

2635
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,000
Spill the beans. No, I smoked a cigarette. Oh, no

2636
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,040
My god forgot I smoked a cigarette last night give

2637
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
God's gonna be angry at me

2638
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,320
All the cigarette comedians are laughing

2639
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,460
They've been waiting

2640
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,360
Darn, I forgot. Oh man. Yeah, I thought we were going home

2641
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,440
I remember we stopped at a at a bar that I forgot we went to

2642
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,200
Who did you go out with so what was what was going on? It was my um, it was a

2643
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,640
My friend, uh, well on the internet. He's known as Dwoob. Oh, yeah

2644
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,600
Yeah, and when I had not seen him in a while. I went over to his house to catch up

2645
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:33,360
With another friend that they're the three of us had gone to college together. So

2646
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,780
Yeah, that's that's that's and they they led you astray they made you they gave you a cigarette

2647
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,960
They throw they totally did they liquored you up and gave you a cigarette and you just puffed away

2648
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:52,480
Oh, I could not consent to smoke that cigarette. I could not give informed enthusiastic consent

2649
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
Uh

2650
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,920
Well, I'm unholy I'm sully

2651
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,760
Yeah gross you got to smoke a holy water cigarette. I don't I don't smoke anymore

2652
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:12,800
But I guess some I guess if I drink sometimes I do and I gotta put holy water in a vape and I think I'm okay

2653
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
That's how you undo it. Oh

2654
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,480
Yeah, I guess you could do that. Can you just vape water? Does it just turn into steam?

2655
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,600
There's a break your or that break your what's what's the mechanics of a vape pen?

2656
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:31,460
So that does it just is a heat thing and it just yeah vaporizes the stuff. Yes, it's a tiny nozzle

2657
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:37,520
It's an induction coil what there is is there is a wire with their high resistance. There's a resistance

2658
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:43,920
There's a an electricity resistant wire that is in a coil and the coil goes around a piece of cotton

2659
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,980
Which is called the wick and the wick absorbs liquid

2660
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:53,400
And so the portion of the cotton that is between the coil gets heated by the inductance of the current and

2661
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,280
That and that vaporizes the liquid that it has absorbed

2662
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,980
That's how it works. So yeah, I guess you could probably do it with water it might holy water

2663
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,880
Potentially once it once it went dry it would start to burn

2664
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,560
So you have to be careful with that

2665
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,040
Yeah, you could do it just you could vape holy steam. No problem. You know what I'm sure people have done it

2666
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:25,400
Yeah, I ordered Chinese food while cheesy was talking so that'll be that'll be here in 10 minutes

2667
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,400
for breakfast

2668
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:36,560
It's it's it's past noon already for me. Oh, yeah, I guess although I've only been up since 11

2669
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,760
Um

2670
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,760
To Ben at September

2671
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,280
Yeah, that means this Halloween

2672
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:49,120
true, I guess it it literally like the day after I moved

2673
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,160
It went from being like hot summer to being like now. It's now. It's cool out

2674
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,040
The season changed at the very at the very moment. Oh

2675
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,800
Man, my new room is so much nicer than my old one my old one sucks so bad

2676
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,880
It was so disgusting you saw the yeah, I saw I saw your old room

2677
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:14,600
You really didn't want me to go in there, but I had to look I had to know where Ben saying I didn't want you to see it

2678
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:21,400
Because it's embarrassing and it's gross and I even I know like this is bad and it reflects poorly on me that I live here

2679
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
But now in your brand-new room

2680
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:30,520
The cockroaches they're they're they're polished. They're they're gleaming. I did see I did see an ant

2681
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:37,240
I never had ants at the old place. I did see one ant, which is a bit concerning. I hope I don't see any more of those

2682
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,280
Ants aren't so bad. I well, I do. I mean they're they're

2683
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,280
What are they gonna do pick you up with their like strength? It was a bit. It was one of the big ants. I don't like that

2684
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,920
I mean, whatever. I guess they're just a

2685
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,720
The fact of life, I mean if you find their ant hill you can just pour molten metal down there

2686
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,800
The old making art sculpture the old place did not have cockroaches, but it had mice everywhere. I

2687
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,160
Never said well

2688
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:13,560
I never saw a mouse in my room until I was moving and then as I was packing boxes in and around the time

2689
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:20,400
I was recording the video. I did finally see one mouse in my room and I was like, oh there it is there

2690
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,680
There's the it's been there the whole time. It might have been

2691
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,440
I don't you know what I think it was because the last couple weeks

2692
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:31,880
I was there my friggin old landlord was sending these work guys in to do like renovations and they cut

2693
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:37,720
The radiator out of my wall and there was just a hole in the floor and the ceiling where the radiator tube

2694
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:42,560
I think the mouse might have crawled in through the friggin hole in the floor that the radiator used to connect to

2695
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,080
That might have been how it got in just at the very end there

2696
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,760
That's just a theory

2697
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,040
Anyway, that was gross I saw that as shit

2698
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,120
That's the one thing it's pests in pests in the kitchen. I can ignore them pests in my room

2699
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,120
That's what if they crawl on me while I'm asleep

2700
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:02,480
So I didn't didn't like you got to get spiders in there to catch them

2701
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:09,040
There were some there were unironically having a spider in your room is good because yeah

2702
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:15,280
The most annoying thing is things flying and things crawling and spiders just sit in the corner

2703
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,120
I what yeah, I was putting up a tapestry

2704
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:23,000
I was putting up my cop killers tapestry actually and I was reaching up into the corner

2705
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,560
And there was a little spider in up in the ceiling corner and it's a hot tall ceiling

2706
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,720
So I hadn't noticed it before and I briefly considered killing it. I was like no, it's probably gonna

2707
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,160
Remove more pests than killing this spider would

2708
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,560
Would do I could remove the one spider now or I could let it remove future small insects for me

2709
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:50,280
So I just let it be. Yeah, so it's a guard. Yeah, I think it was the right. I think it was the right choice

2710
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:58,640
I'm hungover we'll hungover and I feel a little bit bad, but not so bad. I'm recovering

2711
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:06,600
I ordered some more I'm almost out of corn fiber for gummies. I've almost used up the last of it

2712
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,280
I need to get shelf space. I need I need to claim some shelf space

2713
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,280
For my stuff there are shelves down in the kitchen and I think they are labeled with like previous roommates names

2714
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,600
And I think if I maybe if I hurry if I rush I can claim some of those throughout some of that person's old stuff

2715
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,560
And take that shelf space for myself. They get a lot of shit. We got a lot of gummy shit

2716
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,960
They need yeah kitchen real estate for

2717
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:35,080
Yeah, could you padlock it could you install a little padlock?

2718
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,440
No, these are the shelves here. Well, the shelves I'm talking about are just they don't have doors on them

2719
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,100
They're just at the end of a little like quarter. There's just like some open shelves

2720
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:49,200
Which is kind of bad because I would sort of prefer them to be sealed away. So as like

2721
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:56,560
You know like a bag of sugar. I'd rather be inside something to further protect against like flies getting into it or whatever

2722
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:03,360
I guess put a bag of sugar in a tupperware. Yeah, I just have to make sure that they're sealed pretty pretty tight. That's all

2723
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,360
But I'm

2724
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,040
Feeling good

2725
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,720
Feel good. I lit. It's it's improved my mood

2726
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,680
I think not to live in a dingy in a dingy cave and it's stained fucking dirty

2727
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,280
Falling apart piece of shit

2728
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,960
Well, I'm glad. I am glad. I feel happy

2729
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:32,320
I guess we should talk about I mean, do you want to say anything about the tricksy quitting YouTube?

2730
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:39,440
I feel like we should acknowledge it. Oh, we already did but like I don't know what it what it my thoughts on it is

2731
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,600
She's gonna come back. Yeah

2732
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:48,880
With some like retiring the channel. I

2733
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:56,360
Mean, obviously she wasn't making a lot of money a lot of views from those videos. Yeah, I didn't really watch the video

2734
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,360
I somebody summarized it

2735
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:04,640
What I guess it's just like yeah, no, I mean, this isn't you this is yeah

2736
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,840
She she's she has no intentions of getting a different job like a more like traditional job

2737
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:17,160
So I'm sure some sort of internet thing is gonna happen. Well, she said she'll be working working for mint salad now

2738
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,800
Doing what I don't editing her videos. I guess I

2739
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:26,320
Can't imagine how that pays for anything but

2740
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,440
Whatever

2741
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:34,080
Yeah, she will she will figure out that yeah, a real job is actually hard and

2742
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,880
That YouTube money was easier and she will she will be back

2743
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:44,800
The thing the thing with yeah, that the mint thing is not gonna work out ASC presents is not gonna

2744
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:51,440
Pay the bills that whole thing is gonna fall. I give it to I give it two months. I give it two months before that whole living situation

2745
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,080
Implodes and then she'll be back

2746
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,400
But man, what I just want to say what a what a stupid

2747
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:06,840
The whole the vlog is thing. I think that like probably I hadn't not on my radar at all

2748
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,680
I had no idea what's been going on

2749
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:15,320
so I had I had seen the announcement that she was gonna do the month of vlogs and then an announcement at the end and I think that I

2750
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:23,140
Think I don't know it seems to me like the vlog is was actually sort of a last-ditch attempt to like generate interest to like get

2751
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,500
The channel back on track

2752
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:29,660
So I think that maybe if that had happened the announcement would not have been I'm quitting but because it did not work

2753
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,580
She quit but like if so what a

2754
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:38,140
Vlog is was not good one. She didn't even stick to it. She did not post a video every day

2755
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:44,980
She missed several days and two like the stuff she posted was like the laziest like most slapdash stuff like there was nothing

2756
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,940
There was nothing impressive like it was it was not much of a

2757
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,580
Hail Mary, you know, I mean

2758
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:55,540
It's it's been obvious that her heart is not in it

2759
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:01,900
Has been not in it for a very long time. That's I mean, yeah, the last thing she was excited about

2760
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:06,500
I think was the doing rap gigs and she did one or two. Yeah

2761
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:12,700
You mean the real the real life ones. Yeah, they're going to a real life and doing a rap or two. Yeah

2762
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,700
And as I said, yeah

2763
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,700
She's I mean, she's clearly more about she's clearly more interested in

2764
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,380
Wrapping that which is fun. That's fun

2765
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:29,820
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, it's just old news like the the the I'm quitting seems more like clickbait

2766
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:35,580
Than yeah, it doesn't seem like it's an like a notable occurrence. I

2767
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:37,460
I

2768
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,460
Yeah, I would have I guess I would agree with that

2769
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:46,340
It's it's just sort of a what do you what do you what would I call it? It's just sort of a it's just sort of saying out loud

2770
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,420
Yeah, what has kind of just been

2771
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,940
Implicit for a while. I guess that's true

2772
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:57,340
Yeah, okay. Well, I think it's funny. I had a good chuckle over it

2773
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,340
when the video dropped and

2774
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,780
Yeah

2775
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:05,340
Someone someone said I think people thought we were gonna talk a lot about it

2776
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:12,980
Somebody said like oh Ben's gonna Ben's gonna spite. Yeah, the fight so much for the notes for the notes for this episode

2777
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:18,900
I don't have much of my own, but I did type Ben is gonna talk about Trixie. That's all I've got on my notes

2778
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:25,820
Well, I was assuming you would like have a big haha. I like I do I think I think you've already done that

2779
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,820
I think your your ha ha has already

2780
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:34,660
Yeah, come and gone. Yeah, there's not yeah, I've said everything that I really have to say about it at this point

2781
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,940
I just uh

2782
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:41,060
Do I did want to acknowledge I did want to acknowledge to anyone who was wondering? Yes, I did see the video. Yes

2783
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,060
It is funny. Yes, I did

2784
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:46,500
Kill her it I did this is my doing. Yes

2785
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:54,100
So, you know good good week good week for me

2786
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:58,820
Did I really film that video in the same I filmed that yeah

2787
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:03,700
Yeah, and you film the videos and I moved into a good house. Oh my god. It's a red

2788
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,380
I mean moving is a whole big thing. You've probably been like

2789
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,220
Going all over the place for the past few days

2790
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:15,220
Yeah, so it feels like a lot of stuff has happened, which it has it has for me

2791
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,180
Nothing happened. No, it's fine. A lot a lot of

2792
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,580
I'm amazed. I'm amazed that so much. I

2793
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,700
genuinely thought that like

2794
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,700
the recording had been

2795
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:33,460
Last week and I had talked about it already on the show, but I guess I did not so that's very

2796
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:37,020
Funny, I'm watching my my door-dash delivery driver

2797
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:41,620
I'm watching the little red dot crawl across the the Google Maps and approach my house

2798
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:47,540
He's he's three minutes away, and you know what? I think I lost. Oh my god. No. No. Oh, no

2799
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:52,180
I accidentally ordered the tofu. I meant to get the chicken, but I ordered the tofu. I'm so stupid

2800
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,180
I'm such a fucking dweeb

2801
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:56,460
I don't like tofu. It's mediocre

2802
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:01,460
This is this is this is a karma Ben. It's me. I'm trying to see ah

2803
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:04,460
So the soul

2804
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,620
Know what that means

2805
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,980
Well, you pay

2806
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:17,140
All right, he is he's out. He's okay. He's he's almost here. He's outside my door

2807
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,620
He's surely probably getting out of the car right now

2808
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,260
He's oh my god, I'm attention

2809
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:30,980
Do you hear the footsteps? I do not I do not hear the footsteps

2810
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:36,700
I'm waiting for the little I'm waiting for the map to update and say deliver

2811
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:44,660
I don't want to start like a thing and then have you know I gotta go eat I gotta go do that

2812
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:49,580
You know what open the door. I think okay, I've got to go grab it from downstairs. I'll be back in a second

2813
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,460
Okay, I'm back

2814
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,540
What else

2815
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,860
I

2816
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,860
Guess I'm

2817
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:13,340
If there's anything to talk about is that I'm trying to get more productive and it's difficult not

2818
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:18,580
Shitting on yourself. Oh, yeah, you're always you're always trying to be productive. What's up with that?

2819
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:24,440
Because we're always always trying to do things and I'm trying to be pro

2820
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:30,000
Actionate the pro duck the product inators the productionators. Yeah

2821
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,160
Because like September in my head was like, okay

2822
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,260
September is gonna be my

2823
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,380
Working on Clarissa getting that done

2824
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:44,620
I still have these commissions to do. I still have a few load of ghosts books to send off

2825
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,760
That have been returned and I just haven't got around to those things and like

2826
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:55,340
my my default like reaction to wasted time is to shit on myself and

2827
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,100
to be like very

2828
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:05,020
Like realist but like harsh God, it's so it's so mid. It's so mid. It sucks. I hate

2829
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:09,180
And and it's so difficult to like balance

2830
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:12,620
your your realist like production

2831
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,980
like

2832
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:20,100
Like your work ethic stuff, you've got to be serious. You've got to be sensible

2833
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:27,640
you've got to treat the work with respect and not slack off, but I can't like

2834
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,620
Depress myself because that's also bad

2835
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:37,180
It's difficult trying to figure out the the perfect balance because I want to when you say depress yourself

2836
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,460
What do you mean by that?

2837
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,460
to to like, I don't know

2838
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,260
trigger depressive triggered triggered

2839
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,340
mood by like so I

2840
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,780
by by

2841
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:56,900
Like giving myself a hard time instead of being more optimistic about doing better in the future

2842
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:04,060
I feel like if I just say every time like oh, well, I didn't work today, but I'll try next day

2843
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:08,740
I'll do better later. I feel like that it feels a little too insincere

2844
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,060
I I

2845
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:15,420
Gravitate to wanting to be more harsh like no, this is not acceptable. You got to do better

2846
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,580
But I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to bully myself

2847
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:22,700
Because that has led to bad things you would bring what you don't want to

2848
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:28,900
You don't want to do what rubber Ross did to that entity artist and make her kill herself

2849
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:35,380
Yeah, even though she's fine. Yeah, I mean what I mean, I don't think we mentioned that

2850
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:40,340
That nobody actually killed themselves right that whole thing. Well, it was just a potential

2851
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:43,500
Yeah, nothing nothing actually happened. Nothing actually happened

2852
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:48,620
Just this girl stopped posting and unique it was like what is she killed herself though? What if that happened?

2853
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,260
It would be said that would be fucked up. Yeah

2854
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:56,140
It'll be very fucked up wouldn't be Ross's fault, but yeah, it would be pretty fucked up. Yeah

2855
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:00,020
So, I don't know I still I

2856
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:07,820
I've I've made measures to make my my work day more like structured and in a way that I

2857
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:10,660
Can like work with instead of like

2858
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,180
You know when you wake up late and like some of the day is gone

2859
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:18,780
Mm-hmm. Oh, I have less hours to work

2860
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:22,260
This sucks and then it makes it harder to get out of bed

2861
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:26,340
Yeah, then it would have been if you got up earlier the day's already wasted

2862
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:31,060
Yeah, there's like things that it's like, okay, it doesn't matter when I start but from when I start

2863
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:34,300
I have to do at least three hours then take a break for an hour

2864
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:38,260
And then you know, whenever I end up wherever I end up, that's the end of my day

2865
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:44,820
It's not like I'm not bound by the Sun. I can I can work around the Sun. It's fine

2866
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:49,020
Yes, but but but it feels like even though you have the same, you know

2867
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:53,220
14 or 16 hours awake or whatever, you know

2868
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:56,860
It feels if it starts late if it starts late and ends late

2869
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:04,020
It feels like less than if it starts early and ends. Yeah, and then it definitely feels amazing when you happen to wake up

2870
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:10,540
And just get out of bed for I don't know you get out of bed to pee and then you're like, you know what this time

2871
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,980
I'm not gonna go back into bed

2872
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:15,980
I'm gonna do stuff and then it like it's your normal breakfast time

2873
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:19,500
But you already had breakfast and you've done some work already. It's like wow

2874
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,620
So good like it's the perfect thing

2875
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:25,380
Getting out of bed is the hard part, but I think

2876
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:31,180
Not shitting on yourself for not getting out of bed is also an important thing, right?

2877
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:37,780
I mean when you do that you I'm trying to make it so that like no matter when I get out of bed the day starts

2878
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:42,620
Even if I like open my phone, I look at a video that I don't even like looking at

2879
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:47,300
So instead of for two hours and then get out of bed. I that's when the day starts

2880
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,300
I mean, there's there's something to be said

2881
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,740
For like if you

2882
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:53,740
Recognize that like you feel better

2883
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,900
When you wake up early

2884
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:02,820
There's something to be said for okay. Well since I know that about myself. I should you know ensure that I wake up early

2885
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:06,940
That makes me feel better. I guess it's also it's fine to also be like

2886
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:10,580
Well, I should try to feel better even if I don't do that

2887
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:15,620
I guess it's different two different approaches to solving those different approaches basically

2888
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:21,300
The idea that I've been that I've been trying to work in it with is like

2889
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:23,380
um

2890
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:28,340
Having a schedule, but adjusting based on how I react to it

2891
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:31,860
If it's going to lead to burnout, maybe I change

2892
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,580
an aspect of it for the next day

2893
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:40,660
And if it's too lenient maybe rain it in a bit and I don't know I'm just trying things

2894
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:43,140
But I'm ultimately not getting a lot of work done

2895
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:45,380
um

2896
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:47,060
and it

2897
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:51,620
Feels bad. Hmm. Can't really get away from the fact that it feels bad

2898
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,580
that um

2899
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:58,100
I don't know. I'm just I'm just am slow at creating things

2900
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,060
Hmm

2901
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,460
I'm slow at getting into a work groove

2902
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:08,340
And it's difficult forcing myself to act in ways that I'm not used to

2903
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:10,660
sure

2904
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:11,540
um

2905
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:15,700
That's my conundrum. Can you help do you think?

2906
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:20,980
You said okay, so you're you're you say you're slow. Is that like

2907
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,500
Do you think that is uh, uh

2908
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,940
Like what do you

2909
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:33,300
You mean like what are you stupid? Yeah, I mean is that like you mean just like when you work you do it

2910
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:36,340
Slowly or do you mean you take a long time to

2911
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:42,020
No, it's not that I'm slow to to doing something. It's not that that I'm slow particularly. It's that

2912
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:46,340
um, I get very impatient and very antsy very often

2913
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:50,340
So I could work for 40 minutes before I am like, ah, you got to do something else

2914
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:52,660
I think that's normal

2915
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,460
It's normal, but like it would be nice if I could work for two hours

2916
01:43:55,540 --> 01:44:00,420
And then that's more like that's a nicer rounder number is more you can do with the two hour window

2917
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,140
But like if it turns out that my my

2918
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:06,740
Break thing is like every 40 minutes. I need to take a break

2919
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:11,780
I could try that. I think I should try that like more deliberately. I feel like yeah

2920
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,180
I feel like if you find that that's the natural

2921
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:17,060
Rhythm that you fall into

2922
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:23,380
It might be worth. Yeah, just trying to structure your day and your time around that pattern

2923
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,020
Uh

2924
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:30,740
I think too large and there's yeah, there's something there's something to be said for just like knowing yourself

2925
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,460
And rather than trying to like fix your

2926
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,300
tendencies

2927
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:40,900
Just try and yeah go with the flow. So yeah, go go with like structure myself

2928
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:46,020
Structure my work day and my plans around the way that I naturally would do things

2929
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:49,060
Yeah, as long as it doesn't mean I do nothing

2930
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:52,980
So yeah, that I think I should do more frequent breaks

2931
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,540
and less length

2932
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:59,780
It's always sucks when you go on a break and you're like, ah, I'm on a break

2933
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:04,820
Oh, it's over. No. No, I want the break to be an hour long two hours maybe

2934
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:10,100
And then it's like well, then I'm working for 40 minutes and having a two hour break in between

2935
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:14,500
It's like that's not gonna that's not gonna work long term. I need to change that

2936
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:17,460
I need to be more

2937
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:18,500
Gooder

2938
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,020
right

2939
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:21,700
Who doesn't

2940
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:23,700
Sorry to not to be off topic, but

2941
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,020
I feel good that when I think about the fact that I smoked that cigarette last night

2942
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:34,260
I don't think like oh, it was good. I want another one. I think yeah, ill gross. Yeah, feels that is good. Yeah

2943
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:41,140
You were fine. Would you say you were addicted? I mean most people who smoke I would say get a bit addicted at the very least

2944
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:48,020
Yeah for a period there. Yeah, I would get some crave. I would crave it like a big oof a cigarette would feel good right now

2945
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,020
I or like oh, I um

2946
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:52,020
I want to go do that and I mean I would do it

2947
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:58,020
There were periods, uh, where I would smoke basically every day although. I never was like a pack a day

2948
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:02,660
Smoker I would generally smoke. Um, maybe a few a day. Maybe like

2949
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:08,900
Six or eight at most, uh in a day. So I would say I had a bit of a

2950
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:14,260
Yeah, I mean if you're getting cravings for it, you're a little addicted. So yeah for a while there

2951
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,260
Not anymore though

2952
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,260
Uh, it's literally the pandemic

2953
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:22,500
The pandemic just made me not want to leave my house. So I didn't go and buy cigarette

2954
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,060
Thanks, covet

2955
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:28,580
Thank you, covet. Thank you. Kobe. You've done so much for us. Although

2956
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,300
Damn, I saw an article

2957
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:34,020
Wow, this tofu sucks

2958
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,260
I saw an article that was like

2959
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:38,580
Hey, so covet has made everybody sicker

2960
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,140
Everybody has like worse

2961
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:48,020
Lung and heart and brain issues now the whole population is sicker and they compared it like it's it says though everybody in the world

2962
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,580
Took up smoking

2963
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:56,660
It's like it's like it's like the entire population just started smoking cigarettes and now they are all smokers like that's the

2964
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,420
The the the the damage to just health in general

2965
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:04,740
That covet has done to the population. Maybe um aggregate

2966
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:12,580
Do they mean like people who got the the pandemic the the the virus like before vaccines and survived, you know, I don't know

2967
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:16,020
Yeah, I think there any difference. I would imagine that yeah

2968
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:22,100
It probably is worse for people who got it before they were vaccinated worse for people who have gotten it multiple times

2969
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:26,740
I'm sure that the damage is proportional to like how much covet have you had

2970
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,900
uh

2971
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,260
Because it's occasionally i'm like wow that was a long pause

2972
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,060
Maybe I have covet brain fog, but I don't freak out about it for some reason. I'm just so like you know

2973
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,060
I mean, I've always been kind of dumb

2974
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:42,020
I've always been kind of slow. I freaked out about covet brain fog

2975
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:45,460
The fact of the matter is that yeah, lots lots of things

2976
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,340
cause what might be called brain damage

2977
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:53,220
Uh, and such as using twitter such as using twitter such as eating soy

2978
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:54,580
um

2979
01:47:54,580 --> 01:47:59,940
I'm doing right now. I'm getting brain fog. Just just just from the smell of this delicious tofu

2980
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:01,780
and um

2981
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:06,660
Yeah, I I when it yeah, sometimes I can't think of something and I think oh god is a brain fog

2982
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:11,940
But then I'm like I I always was like that. I always had those moments. It's not weird

2983
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,660
It's not a it's I don't think covet has changed my thought patterns in any meaningful way

2984
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:19,940
So yeah normie, but like if it did

2985
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,900
Then I mean I'd work with it

2986
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:25,220
I I mean it's sort of

2987
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:26,100
I'd have to work with it

2988
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,580
But like it's the sort of thing that happens to

2989
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:34,820
Most people at some age time in their life. Maybe just covet like oh if I'm like older

2990
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:38,900
I get to like 60 and that starts happening because of age

2991
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,060
um

2992
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:48,020
Uh, the covet brain fog would have made it happen much earlier. Well, I mean that was 60 year olds are not completely out of

2993
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:52,980
You know out of they're not completely palace. Yeah, I can do it

2994
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:58,180
I can do it. There's no there's nothing to freak out about I suppose at least not for me

2995
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:03,620
But it is a good excuse. It is a good excuse where I'm like sitting there and thinking

2996
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:06,100
I gotta think of to I gotta do a work

2997
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,460
I can't do it covet brain fog probably

2998
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:13,700
Gotta be that fog. I I had you know what I had thoughts

2999
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:18,900
Like that even before covet I would think like I would be sitting there and I would be thinking like

3000
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:24,340
Why can't I do anything? Why am I so bad at everything? Why am I stupid?

3001
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:29,540
Why am I such a failure? Is it am I just am I just dumb? Is there just something wrong with me?

3002
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,220
um

3003
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:33,220
So, you know

3004
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,940
Now I can blame covet at least. Yeah

3005
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,940
So um

3006
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:44,340
Uh, I don't know that's really what's been going on in my mind. I I uh

3007
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:51,700
The only thing I've been consistent with which is good is that my my workout regime regimen has been done

3008
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,540
in

3009
01:49:53,540 --> 01:50:00,180
Like three times a week. That's good consistently since the beginning of july. So I'm not I'm not slipping

3010
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:01,540
hmm

3011
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,980
that's very good

3012
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,980
Regardless of how good the workout is

3013
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:09,060
I'm doing it when I have to do it and that's uh good

3014
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,620
You know one of the friends I was hanging out with last night

3015
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:18,420
Told me that they uh started a they started seeing a therapist. They got done. Um, I think it was it was well butrin

3016
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:21,220
I think it was well butrin. They got on some kind of

3017
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:24,900
Some kind of antidepressant medication and they said they started

3018
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:32,180
They've started exercising. They've done a regimen and uh, I mean they had they had like just started so they couldn't really

3019
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:36,500
I couldn't really evaluate like oh, yeah, they seem to be it seems to be improving their

3020
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:38,660
life or whatever

3021
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,660
But uh, I don't know

3022
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,660
for people

3023
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:46,580
Yeah, I mean exercise is good generally just to move your body around but um,

3024
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,500
I don't know whether my workout is like strenuous enough

3025
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:57,780
To be a very huge, but it's definitely a positive any any it's definitely a 80 20 even even a little bit is like a big

3026
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:02,100
Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's good in that way physically

3027
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:06,340
But it's also good knowing that I'm keeping up with that even if I'm like

3028
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:10,500
Not creative some of the time I'm like, uh

3029
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:14,420
I got I still have this lord of ghosts that has been sent back

3030
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:20,740
I haven't done anything. It's still in like the the the packaging that they sent it back in like the

3031
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:23,460
They ripped open the envelope and everything's fucked up

3032
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:26,100
And I just didn't want to open it and figure out how to send it back

3033
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:31,860
I've got terrible news terrible news one of the lord of ghosts a button eyes came off of his sheet

3034
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:35,860
And I moved no he lost one of I still I have the the button

3035
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:39,060
I mean came it was

3036
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:47,060
It was hand stitched all every button. I know so there's this likely that will happen because it's okay a perfect sewer

3037
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:48,500
It's okay

3038
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:54,340
Because I minted him as an NFT and so even though he's been destroyed. I still nothing has changed

3039
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:58,020
I still have the asset. I still control the asset. No, it's fine

3040
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,900
um

3041
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:05,380
What were you talking about? Oh, yeah, I have not been working out. I have been

3042
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,820
Dieting I've been eating pretty clean and I have lost a lot of weight

3043
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:13,540
And I'm I'm back down to the weight that I was when I was working out like two years ago

3044
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:16,020
Even though I have not been so I guess I'm just skinny now

3045
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,580
I mean, I'm not that skinny, but

3046
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:21,060
Skinny by my standards

3047
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:24,500
That's good. No, that's gooder. Mm-hmm

3048
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:27,460
I just do this I have I just

3049
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:33,700
Cycled between like weigh in like 160 and then I'll go up to like 200 and I'll lose it weight down to like 160

3050
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:38,740
And I'm at the low point in my cycle and I hope I hope to keep it that way

3051
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,820
I hope to hope to stay here this time

3052
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:46,260
Well, it's time to go back up if you're at the lowest point. That's how curves work. Mm-hmm over time

3053
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,340
It has to fluctuate the same amount

3054
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:51,540
It's an infinite spiral. It's an infinite spiral just like DNA

3055
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:55,380
You need to put on 40 pounds of just muscle

3056
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:57,620
honestly

3057
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:01,460
Honestly, absolutely. Honestly. I do need to do that. Yeah

3058
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,100
That would rule

3059
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:10,420
Eat a raw steak while bench pressing or whatever. Whatever it is you muscle heads do

3060
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:17,860
All I would need all I would need to do all I would need to get back to lifting and I would need to just eat

3061
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,900
More proteins. I already I already eat a lot of protein

3062
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:24,900
I'm not keto anymore, but I do eat meat

3063
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:29,700
Oh, just meat makes up a pretty high percentage of my diet anyway. So

3064
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:32,260
I think I'm good on that

3065
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,540
I realized I I have like a huge five pound bag of protein powder that I've like barely

3066
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:40,340
used so

3067
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:42,420
I just start using that

3068
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,540
um

3069
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:45,540
Ugh

3070
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:50,580
I'm so disappointed. I'm so disappointed in this in this food anymore. I finish it

3071
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,580
Sad just you save it for me. I'll come get it. Okay

3072
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,740
Um

3073
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,340
Uh, what?

3074
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:07,860
We've been going for two hours. Okay. I'm trying to think if there's anything else

3075
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,980
That I wanted to talk about. Oh shit

3076
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,660
I didn't I didn't tweet ask pcp

3077
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,140
this week

3078
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:20,020
Should I do that now? It may as well. All right

3079
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,820
I feel like people

3080
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:28,180
We're not gonna miss out on that much. No, not really. I meant to

3081
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,820
I I said I would uh fix the

3082
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:35,940
The speak pipe after I moved well, I have moved and I haven't done it

3083
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,100
But I mean I just didn't hear about two days

3084
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:41,300
So this this week I will try and uh and do that

3085
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:45,140
Someone just

3086
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,940
Someone just added

3087
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,940
the pcp account

3088
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,580
And said fool. Oh wait, they were adding

3089
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:56,580
My meaty last week saying I didn't fix the voicemails yet. They said

3090
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,640
Phobos Roblo says fool at me

3091
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:03,300
Through um

3092
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:09,780
Oh, I guess I can say um, uh my runescape adventure

3093
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:15,300
I have been mining iron still, but I'm very close to level 85 mining

3094
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,980
I'm like

3095
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:17,860
eight

3096
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:24,020
Or seven hours of mining away from getting 85 mining, which means I'll be able to mine runeitor

3097
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:28,660
Which is the best or because it's blue-ish. It's like teal

3098
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,700
It's a teal blue

3099
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:36,340
And I will be able to I'm gonna go to the wilderness. I'm gonna see what it's like

3100
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:43,620
Trying to get a single piece of ore and I might make a video about that momentous occasion

3101
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:47,300
Little follow-up from the the previous one

3102
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,060
That's my runescape lore

3103
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:57,620
It's it's so fun. Yes. It's so interesting. Yes, right. That's correct runescape

3104
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:02,980
Sorry, I'm trying to think of what to say and the ask pcp message

3105
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:08,660
We're hate ask pcp. We're almost done recording. Sorry if we miss your message this week lull, but reply here

3106
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:11,860
And we'll read your

3107
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,500
post

3108
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,500
Okay, thank you post haste

3109
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:21,860
Yeah, oh shit, I should have said that I should have said post haste, but I

3110
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:30,580
Okay, that's great. Uh, it looks like shit my message sucks. Oh, you know what?

3111
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:34,660
You know what does blow about this house though? Uh, the internet's actually quite bad

3112
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:38,820
I'm actually I'm actually glad that it has not cut out there

3113
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:43,140
I get pretty long periods where like the internet just kind of crafts out and stops working

3114
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:45,780
So I I have to figure out

3115
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:48,980
Is that an improvable problem or is it just like the

3116
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:57,780
Could you could you do the thing with the internet boosters? Yeah, I might yeah the wi-fi extender I

3117
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:02,980
Yeah, I'm gonna try and set that up and see if it uh fixes the problem

3118
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:09,860
But yeah at the moment my internet is not very reliable. So I'm glad that it has not fucked up

3119
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,580
this call at least

3120
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:15,140
Oh, yeah, it's probably

3121
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:17,140
Improvable, uh, we'll see

3122
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:21,140
You know what? Let me see if we had any messages from last week that we didn't

3123
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:24,260
Read

3124
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:28,740
I think

3125
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:32,820
Yeah, we oh we got another I think the we got another uh art mail from new

3126
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:35,940
Here, uh

3127
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,940
Yeah, I think this is

3128
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,140
I think this is a sequel

3129
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,620
No, this is the same no, this is the same one

3130
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,300
Isn't it the the the nose i'm gonna look at it again anyway

3131
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:51,940
uh

3132
01:57:51,940 --> 01:58:00,820
No, this yes. No, this is the same one new is uh doing a bit for the dojin the dojin is coming along by the way kaiju did two more

3133
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,460
Pages oh, I think I posted them in the pcp server. So you saw them

3134
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,740
Oh wait kaiju's them

3135
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,780
Yeah, the ones that I posted that were by kaiju

3136
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:15,620
Let me have a look

3137
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,260
Oh, they are

3138
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:23,220
Yeah, yeah, they were they were they were more similar to the other thing

3139
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:28,580
I thought see that's why I thought kaiju would be a good replacement because they kind of have a sort of similar style

3140
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:32,580
See you can almost not even tell them apart. Uh, that was uh, yeah

3141
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:37,380
But uh a few weeks ago. I was saying like ah, fuck it have different art styles

3142
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:40,420
But it is nice if they were if they're like yeah

3143
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:47,380
The the the anime vibe is similar. Yeah. Well, I think drinking moth has done a pretty a pretty good job of matching

3144
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:50,260
the style as well

3145
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,980
New will not match at all and that's okay

3146
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:58,660
Uh simsie that's okay by me simsie's page. Uh looks

3147
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,540
Actually closer than I expected

3148
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:03,060
He he got more

3149
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:07,540
He got he got close to seeing the simsie one. Is it is it just a sketch right now? It's just it's just a sketch

3150
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:15,700
I can show you if you want actually yeah DM me or put in the pcp chat. Uh, where did he post that here we go

3151
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:20,020
It's only yeah, it's only partially

3152
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:24,100
Can I might even copy this, uh

3153
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:31,460
It might be too big. Oh no, it's posting there it is

3154
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,700
Oh

3155
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:42,500
I think I did see this somewhere. Maybe I didn't I don't remember posting it but uh

3156
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:51,780
Yeah, it does it's got the the chibi ear. Yeah, chibi ear than simsie usually does. Yeah, it's very nice

3157
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:57,380
It's pretty it's pretty good. I mean it looks it's good. It looks good. It's pretty close

3158
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:02,260
Yeah, close enough only only half the page is done, but like it looks really it looks cute

3159
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:10,340
But um, yeah, I mean girl. Yeah, I went I picked kaiju first because I thought he was a pretty close match in terms of style to ed

3160
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:13,700
But uh, it don't really I mean he's he's taken too long

3161
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:16,900
Uh, it would never get done if I just let him do the whole thing. So

3162
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,620
Oh, well

3163
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:20,580
Uh

3164
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:25,940
Anything done is better than anything complete is better than anything not complete. You know what I'm saying

3165
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:29,780
Yes, yeah

3166
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:32,820
It sure is good to have complete things completed

3167
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:38,180
I think I heard that from I think I heard that from brian leo mali, but I don't think it's an original

3168
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,260
I think he was quoting someone else

3169
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:45,780
On his tumblr his blog or something when he said the best thing you can do is make scott pilgrim

3170
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:52,020
He said uh on the subject on the subject of like finishing things versus like being a being a progress

3171
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:54,500
Yeah, a procrastinator or like a perfectionist who's like

3172
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:58,580
You know, oh, I never finish anything because it's never good enough. I never finish it and he said

3173
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:05,780
Well, anything complete is is automatically better than anything that is isn't complete. So if you don't finish something, it's worthless

3174
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:11,220
Uh, yeah, still still hard to like really feel that sometimes though

3175
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:16,420
Ah, yeah, like I I know it so well and it's like yes, of course

3176
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:21,300
It's better that I do it, but I don't want it to suck. I want to do it good

3177
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,820
I want to make a nice drawing sometime. Right sure sure

3178
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:31,380
Uh, but like unironically the the half of the course is a gun smoke

3179
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:36,340
But drawing is hard you try and you try and it still doesn't look good, but that's okay. That's okay. That's okay

3180
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:44,260
Rittman is so smart. Yeah, he's he said I down to earth wisdom

3181
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:47,060
He's got a humble

3182
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:52,180
With mine humble brain

3183
02:01:54,580 --> 02:01:56,580
Okay, I think that we got a

3184
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:59,300
Stop me if we read this question last week

3185
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,540
from Rob

3186
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:05,220
Right now I'm having issues with my parents being unsupportive of my lifestyle

3187
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:08,340
Have you ever experienced something similar? And if so, how did you cope?

3188
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:12,180
Were you able to get through to them eventually? I'm having a hard time with this

3189
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:16,500
Do we do we read that one last week? I don't think we read that one. No, okay

3190
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:20,020
Parents being unsupportive of your lifestyle

3191
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,300
I guess

3192
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,300
I mean the closest thing

3193
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,700
I would say when I was like

3194
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:29,860
Shortly out of college

3195
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:33,700
My dad did not understand why I was not getting a job

3196
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:36,820
Why I was not out you know pounding the pavement

3197
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:42,740
Pounding the pavement looking for you know 40 hours a week regular regular employment

3198
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:48,260
Uh, so he would be very frustrated with me over that stuff

3199
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:52,740
And how did I cope with it? Honestly, I just kind of had to

3200
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:58,020
Placate him as best I could because I was living under his roof. So like I couldn't

3201
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,740
Just tell him to fuck off

3202
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,740
uh, I just kind of had to

3203
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:07,620
Just kind of had to grin and bear it and do what he said for a while and then eventually I moved out

3204
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,180
And now I don't have to do what he says anymore

3205
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:14,420
Um, yeah, yeah, I never really had a lot of

3206
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:21,780
Like non-supportiveness from my parents, but I have like had like yeah, you should probably try to do this

3207
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,620
We'd like it if you did that. Yeah, and I'm like, um, I'm trying

3208
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,860
I think at the time

3209
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:30,180
When I told them that I was making money off patreon

3210
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:36,020
They stopped caring so much because they're they're they're their worries were mostly that I wasn't able to support myself

3211
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:38,900
I'm like, I'm I'm bringing money in don't worry about it

3212
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,380
So they don't really mind too much

3213
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:43,540
Yeah, I'll

3214
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,020
Well, we got a

3215
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:51,860
We got a question about um, what do you do if your parents are unsupportive of your lifestyle? How do you cope with it?

3216
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:57,220
Talk to them or don't we don't talk what?

3217
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:05,300
I you you're unable to escape. I'm not sure if rob lives with his parents or not. He's not specified

3218
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:10,900
I mean the the hi cheesy welcome back. Hi. Hello. I'm back. Yes

3219
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:16,100
I mean, I feel like if if you're living with your parents, this is

3220
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,980
the sort of situation where

3221
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:22,100
You would need to find a way to cope because you kind of scape them

3222
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:29,220
If you can't yeah, you're gonna have to if you really do a lot of like find ways to hide what you do

3223
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:32,420
I mean, I would just try everything in your power to move out

3224
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:35,140
It yeah, if um

3225
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:40,180
Yeah, if it comes down to like a just a fundamental difference of values like they

3226
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:43,780
Think you should be doing something else and you don't think so. Yeah

3227
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:49,860
The some might be that the only thing to do is you got to just go on your own and do something else

3228
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:54,980
And if it's not possible, I would say don't worry about lying to them in the meantime

3229
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:59,780
Don't worry about lying through your teeth. Just so that they don't like ruin

3230
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:04,020
I would say lying is you're doing I would say lying is acceptable

3231
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,900
Lying until you can get out of there and then getting out of there

3232
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,700
If if if it can't be resolved

3233
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:14,980
Don't worry about being like secretive. I would say

3234
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,420
I would say I don't know if it's like

3235
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,900
If it's I don't know what it is like

3236
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:24,500
What does he mean by lifestyle does he mean? I don't know because he's

3237
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:28,740
Gay or a furry or something like that or just friends or like

3238
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:33,940
Or does he or does he mean like not not aligned with the parents or maybe that or just

3239
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:38,020
Or is he is he like a neat or something or he doesn't have a job or something like that

3240
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:41,540
Or he's he wants to be one thing and they think like no, you should be going to school

3241
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:43,620
You should get a job or something like that

3242
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,540
Uh, it sort of depends

3243
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:47,940
On what what exactly depends but largely

3244
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,540
um

3245
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:51,540
if you're at the if you're

3246
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,340
unable to

3247
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:56,340
gain independence

3248
02:05:56,340 --> 02:06:03,780
Uh, try not to like aggravate them. I suppose if they are likely to throw you out or like burn a bridge or like

3249
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:09,700
Cause you problems you you have you have to guard your uh connection to uh

3250
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,500
Support what what oh fucking my alarm's going off. I mean you you have to do

3251
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:19,860
You have to do what you have to do in order to ensure that you will not be thrown out on the street, right?

3252
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,100
Look, uh, maybe

3253
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:28,660
I don't know. Don't don't not consider maybe killing your parents as an option to like that can be on the table as well

3254
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:32,900
You know, I don't know. I feel like you're getting trouble for that

3255
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:38,020
Like if you if you want to like, you know, it's all about you being comfortable. You know, they they're in the way of that. Well

3256
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:45,060
Like they they turn the channel when you want to watch some things like it's my turn for the tv

3257
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:47,540
You you you got to do something

3258
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:51,300
My parents can't just watch tv at another time. You have to destroy that

3259
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:56,180
My parents don't approve of my lifestyle. They don't understand why I watch all of quintin reviews

3260
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:58,420
nine hour long, uh

3261
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:00,580
disney channel sitcom retrospectives

3262
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:03,380
They think it's cringe and I can't why can I explain?

3263
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:06,500
That it's important to us zoom or zoom or culture

3264
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:14,660
Um, look look mom. I know I know pan pizza just fired me from being his podcast editor. Okay. I'm in between jobs right now

3265
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:17,700
All right, so you can't I can't let you any drug money this week

3266
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:24,500
My parents are stoop. My parents are fucking loony lefties and they don't think I should be minting nfts

3267
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:26,740
Uh, they uh, have an agenda

3268
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:28,180
What's

3269
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:32,660
Yeah, what's the nft? Who wants his nfts bought up? I'm moving the fuck out of this shithole

3270
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:34,420
They're trying I just tell it

3271
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:38,180
They're trying to bully me. They're trying to bully me into suicide for making nft

3272
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:42,100
They're trying to cry bully me. They're taking away my don't they

3273
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,940
My parents won't stop going on twitter and

3274
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:48,980
Trying to cancel me

3275
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:54,260
Making up grooming allegations. They just they they think it's funny

3276
02:07:55,380 --> 02:07:58,180
Um, oh, yeah, where the damn

3277
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:01,540
Gosh, yeah, I get have we answered this guy's question

3278
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:08,420
In all seriousness, if you're like gary trans you should move the fuck out of there as soon as possible if they're against that lifestyle

3279
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,540
You're not gonna

3280
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:13,700
You're not gonna live comfortably and eventually like hiding is gonna make you go fucking insane

3281
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:19,620
If that's if that should yeah, if that's the issue then yes, I would I would think although I mean

3282
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:21,940
Yeah, if you can't support god, you know

3283
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:28,420
If you can't support yourself and you gotta do what you gotta do and if like being openly whatever is gonna get you

3284
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:31,780
Homeless, you know, you might have to be sneaky

3285
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:38,580
Uh to preserve your to preserve your access to vital resources. You got to treat it like a survival game

3286
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:44,980
Yeah, you can't get you can't let your uh, your bars go too low. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm

3287
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:46,900
Exactly

3288
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:54,500
Look, that's that's the the extent of that. I think the perfect strategy would be just don't pay the irs any taxes

3289
02:08:55,780 --> 02:09:00,900
That's the advice I find like three other guys who are like zealots

3290
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,140
And at celebrities like move in with them

3291
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:07,300
And then just same save money for an RV and I think you'll be

3292
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,300
Wrapping is hot right now

3293
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:19,460
It will if you need practice you can practice by um rapping along with Lincoln Park and that

3294
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:23,780
Your skills videos make videos where you talk about the MCU

3295
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:30,420
You know and anything maybe maybe make a maybe make a podcast where you talk about sheatholk every week

3296
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:37,300
Listen, you're in in life. Your parents are the ultimate big money connections. You must you must preserve them

3297
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,540
You must preserve them at any cost

3298
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:43,780
Uh, all right enough of that

3299
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:45,540
uh

3300
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,980
let's um

3301
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:48,420
something something

3302
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:50,260
Sai monday says

3303
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:52,900
I know you update spotify before I know you mentioned the f cap

3304
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:57,460
Maybe you can make a new account or try a different distributor. I use anchor fm same copy spotify

3305
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,540
It's simple upload to auto distribute spotify

3306
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:02,900
Signed one of the fans who use the spotify, uh

3307
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,180
I don't want to make a different account

3308
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:12,020
I mean, I guess we I guess we could because we just make it like a procrastinator spotify account two

3309
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:15,460
Because the first one hit its episode limit two

3310
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:20,340
Crescinators because there's two of us honestly. Maybe that is the thing to do. Oh what a hassle

3311
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:23,380
The two crass

3312
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:25,460
There's they're they're crossing. They're two

3313
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:26,900
Yeah

3314
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:29,460
You know what it's true. Um, okay

3315
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:34,180
Sanky c warby seedle says how does the guest system work?

3316
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:39,460
Is there an open invite to select people whoever shows up was in or is there something more to it? Um

3317
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:44,420
It's it's pretty much just like if you've been a guest before yeah

3318
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:49,220
Previous guests like a previous guests are mostly welcome to come back on if they

3319
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:51,060
want to

3320
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:52,900
um, I mean

3321
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:56,820
Never paint and asha were on the other day and that was just never paint

3322
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:59,860
Just asked me if they could come on because he wanted to talk about tulkin

3323
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,020
And I said, okay

3324
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:07,540
And I kind because I kind of knew those guys like I'd seen them around and talked to them on discord and on twitter and stuff before

3325
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,540
So I I already kind of knew them

3326
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:12,260
Basically, it's just if we know you

3327
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:18,820
And you ask to come on we'll usually say yes, and that's and that's and that's how I got on this episode

3328
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:23,780
Oh, yeah, you just said hey ben. I want to talk about fucking unique namesaurus is a stupid video

3329
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:27,780
And I said that's easier for me than watching it. So yes

3330
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:30,260
Yeah

3331
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:32,260
We're all just shitting on it already

3332
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:38,180
And uh and ben server. Oh, that's right. Well, like I could extend that's right also helps me like

3333
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:40,100
flush out

3334
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:43,460
My ideas I because I might make a video responsive is

3335
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,260
um, I'm on the fence about it, but

3336
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:51,460
Because I've been so fucking yeah, I mean it doesn't sound like a terrible idea

3337
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:57,860
Um, yeah, I mean I was gonna name it something like I I watched this eight hour long video

3338
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:02,580
So you don't that would be actually actually that's a good I like that. I think that's

3339
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:04,980
a good idea

3340
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:09,060
It's a good. It's a good title. Yeah, it has the right attitude. I'm the drama critic

3341
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:13,620
I watched an eight hour video. I'm cheesy manfredo. I watch

3342
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,500
Um, that's good

3343
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:21,540
The next question was will it's also likely catch up to one piece or will he wait until two piece to do so?

3344
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:23,380
I will catch up

3345
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:25,380
I'll get around to it. I've been busy

3346
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:28,340
As I've two pieces bikini bottom

3347
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:35,060
What it's spongebob. Oh, yeah, they that's when they that's when the crew meets spongebob

3348
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:38,900
And uh, honestly, I love this little guy. Honestly, why not honestly?

3349
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,620
Why why not?

3350
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:45,780
Oh, I can picture it in my head. Luffy meets spongebob. He's like, oh, I love this little guy

3351
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:49,940
You want to be our you want to be our crew chef and then sanji starts crying like but I thought I was

3352
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:56,900
They just have krabby pan. Yeah. Oh my god. Sanji versus spongebob like like spongebob versus neptune

3353
02:12:57,300 --> 02:13:00,980
Like it's funny though because like the spongebob is like

3354
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:06,420
Canonically like very small compared to a human. Yeah. I mean, he's the size of a sponge

3355
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:07,780
He's the size of a sponge

3356
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:15,460
So it'd be like like sanji and his big chef thing and then it would be like like in a fishbowl next to him making krabby patties

3357
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:20,580
It'd be it'd be funny or if he it's my god is also stronger than sanji and like

3358
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:24,980
He observes the spot in the in the monster tree as

3359
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:31,060
Sandy and and sanji have to get into like a karate kick fight with each other. They're equally mad

3360
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,940
Wait and then and then

3361
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:38,820
Spongebob punches luffy and luffy absorbs it because he's made of rubber and then luffy gomu gomu gatling guns

3362
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:44,260
Spongebob, but spongebob just absorbs all the blows because he's a sponge. You're like, oh, we can't beat each other. We're at a stalemate

3363
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:47,860
And he's and he's all like wait a second

3364
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:51,380
Uh, spongebob is the key here. He's gonna be the guy who's gonna take on um

3365
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:57,540
Who of our fallen mucumo as they as they enter the fucking celestial dragons territory?

3366
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,780
This is

3367
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:04,660
Actually, this is funny. I almost I almost wanted one piece right?

3368
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,340
One sponge piece one sponge

3369
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:13,460
I'll feel cringe one bob. Um, oh, this is gonna make me feel cringe if I don't do it

3370
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:20,180
If this episode comes out and I didn't do this I almost want to draw it and then uh, and then and then luffy beats up plankton

3371
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:26,900
Is all you I you're trying to take away that krabby fatty formula. SpongeBob needs that

3372
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,620
Plankton

3373
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:33,700
I think I think I think I think not me and usa would be not me and usa would fight plankton

3374
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:39,940
And plankton would be in some sort of giant robot or something. I think plankton would be like taken in by by buggy's screw

3375
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:48,180
I think uh, zora would fight sandy because sandy is like black coated and all like the human medium

3376
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:51,380
And uh

3377
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:56,900
Black people so he he zora only fights like darkest way majority of his fights

3378
02:14:57,220 --> 02:15:02,340
He fought king and he fought I forget what number he was but the guy who could turn himself into number one

3379
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:03,540
He was number one

3380
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:09,460
He fought king and he fought number one cock cock is is white for sure. So that's an exception, but um

3381
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,900
I

3382
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:17,460
And

3383
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:19,620
Because um

3384
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:21,620
And I don't know about that

3385
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:26,660
And zora was always talking about wanting to remove usa. I remember there was a whole tick that where someone explains

3386
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:29,300
That zora is

3387
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,860
Wait, what is what is he saying about removing? Yeah, that's like

3388
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:36,740
But you remember when usa was he always jokes about us up was um

3389
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:43,300
Like left the crew. Yeah, um because they were gonna get rid of the going Mary in water seven, right?

3390
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:48,020
Yeah, and zora was like the like everyone was like no soap. Don't go and zora was like

3391
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:54,180
Like like if you're a man be a man and like like actually act on this instead of whining

3392
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:59,060
If you're gonna leave the crew leave, you know, that's the sort of stance. He took he was he was he was he was

3393
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:06,660
He almost he almost called him boy, but he but he uh, but he restrained himself. Yeah, and then and then usa was like, you know what?

3394
02:16:06,980 --> 02:16:08,980
You're right. I'm leaving

3395
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:15,860
And and like even luffy was like no don't go but zora was like no this is how the pirate's life is a pirate's life for me

3396
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:17,860
Maybe it takes a drink

3397
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:18,660
Said it

3398
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:23,220
I think my favorite my favorite little joke is when um, they get usa back

3399
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:27,220
Like after he apologized and luffy like stretches out to grab him

3400
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:32,500
And he's back on the ship zora. I love the little thought bubble that zora has where he's like damn

3401
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,580
I guess I gotta stop saying it

3402
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:39,460
Because he started saying it like after just casually around

3403
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:45,380
But but once usa was back, he's like like he's not mad enough to say it in front of usa

3404
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:48,660
Yeah, zora zoro's uh

3405
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:51,300
Zoro's a big uh, he's a big free speech guy

3406
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:54,820
He thinks uh, you know, you're thinking it. You might you might as well say it

3407
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:59,140
Everybody thinks it is not even japanese would be on the jargon podcast

3408
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:03,220
No

3409
02:17:03,860 --> 02:17:06,740
Um, I can see it fucking. Yeah

3410
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:09,540
Where where was I?

3411
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:13,060
Uh, uh, what how do we even get on this subject? Oh, will I catch up on?

3412
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:15,780
SpongeBob, I will cut yeah one. Yeah sponge bob

3413
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:18,980
Uh, I hope that answers george bubman's question

3414
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:25,380
The next question is ask bcp. How was slash is the fuco you read slash our reading ben?

3415
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:32,500
Um, I won't take too long to answer this but I'm like I'm only like 70 pages into this big ass book of it

3416
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:38,420
And uh, mostly what I've been reading is about the development of the western justice system

3417
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,940
And how uh, it used to there used to be different

3418
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:45,060
basically there used to be

3419
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:46,500
It

3420
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:50,500
Like a try there didn't used to be things like criminal trials. There didn't used to be like a state

3421
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:54,340
It used to just be a civil matter between two individuals

3422
02:17:54,740 --> 02:18:00,820
One of whom was wronged by the other and it would basically just it would basically just be a matter of rallying the community

3423
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:03,940
Like get people on your side to say fuck that guy. He fucked me over

3424
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:10,980
And then just people would just demand reparations from each other and enforce that by whatever force they could muster

3425
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:18,420
And it was basically just like a slightly more civil way of conducting like war and and uh banditry

3426
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:23,060
And and violence against each other. It was like we don't have to we don't have to kill each other

3427
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:28,660
We don't have to engage in an armed conflict. However, you are an asshole and I hate you and I am going to kick your ass

3428
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:32,180
So you can just let me do that or you can like pay me some money

3429
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:34,740
And I'll leave you alone

3430
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:38,660
And some such and such about like the church model of the inquiry

3431
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:42,500
Is sort of the basis for what we now consider like a like criminal trial

3432
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:45,060
a fact finding

3433
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:51,300
Enterprise of like determining what happened and what was done in the past and by who and this was like a model that didn't used to really exist

3434
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:55,220
Uh, so it's been it's interesting and I like it. I should read more of it

3435
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:56,900
I've only read like

3436
02:18:56,900 --> 02:19:02,020
I have not been reading very fast because I'm only like 70 pages in that's like a page a day or something

3437
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:04,420
Probably averages out something like that

3438
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:06,420
Uh

3439
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:08,420
Next question is

3440
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:11,620
Well, we've got another, um

3441
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:16,900
Oh god, we've got another, uh, imager album from vinnie

3442
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:19,780
You're all posted. Yeah

3443
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:23,780
There is benny the uh, okay

3444
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:27,380
Is this is this guy this guy, uh with the these

3445
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:33,620
Have we seen these before I feel like I've seen some of these this one. I don't think

3446
02:19:34,180 --> 02:19:37,060
Oh, no, no, that's no, I think these are new. I think these are new

3447
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:43,860
I like that I'm skinny in this picture. That's the truth now. That's the truth now

3448
02:19:44,420 --> 02:19:50,260
It's funny how well like all of the musculature is is is done on that. He is like

3449
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:53,380
Yeah, he's very

3450
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:55,540
Vinnie is is very

3451
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:57,620
He's very focused on that on that

3452
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,340
This looks like shipping ire

3453
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:03,620
Like like this person ships you guys together. I guess so then

3454
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:09,940
Then saints stand slime time form and whoopity the byproduct of his body fuels the form of his stand after ben experience

3455
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:14,500
Ketosis for the first time the spirit of his fat cells manifested his stand slime time

3456
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:18,660
Then saints proficiency and imagination further developed his uses of his latent abilities

3457
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:23,220
The filth slime and sludge surroundings of ben saints surroundings can be transmuted into slime

3458
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:29,060
And he can manipulate with his stand the limitation to ben saints abilities depend on his hydration and knowledge of chemical compounds

3459
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:33,620
The story of you trolling other kin forms is where I got the idea of your fat

3460
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:38,020
That is now your slime being the basis of your joe gibson. Oh my god. I can't believe

3461
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:40,660
He remembers that

3462
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:43,860
From when I used when I used to when I used to make troll accounts to troll the other

3463
02:20:47,140 --> 02:20:50,260
Well, yeah, there was one that I had was I I was like a

3464
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:57,060
What character that I made up was like a guy who believed in like Japanese style like nature spirits and he like identified

3465
02:20:57,140 --> 02:21:01,140
He was like a theater. He was like a I'm gonna get as fat as possible sort of guy

3466
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:08,100
Who like believed that he was the incarnation of his own like body fat and he just wanted to like increase himself

3467
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:11,140
That guy got banned really fast

3468
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:13,860
That was pretty epic that guy got banned fast

3469
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:19,460
And he was banned because the profile picture I used was like an old painting of like a fat like noblemen

3470
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:25,700
But like that doesn't seem fair. It was literally just like a picture of a fat guy like what is objectionable

3471
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:27,700
About that

3472
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:29,460

3473
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:34,340
They're fat phobic. They were they were fat phobic. They were fat phobic. I was just living my truth and

3474
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:38,980
They didn't like it. Um, they didn't they didn't appreciate it

3475

So I may enter the most true ketosis

3592
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:15,780
With Nate's cum I can make the best keto gummies

3593
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:18,740
All out of cummies

3594
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:21,780

3595
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:24,260
I don't have Nate's cum yet

3596
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:29,220

02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:00,980
It's like, yeah, this is like

3620

At the bottom of the pcp iceberg that's you look that's you sound like the very very bottom of the pcp iceberg

3621
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:10,740
Underneath it says I haven't been a fan of the pcp for five years

3622
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:16,420
It's not it's just the the length of time you become you are a fan. Just you become like a freak

3623
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,980
You end up down there

3624
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:21,860
I get I get pictured the whole iceberg and just

3625
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:24,660
weird phrases that like

3626
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:27,940
Need like two hour videos to explain what they mean like

3627
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:33,780
All the way at the bottom. It's like it would say um, it's a jeff never left the pcp

3628
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:38,900
Icebergs jeff never left the pcp

3629
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:47,140
There's one more. This is the only new voicemail it received it's called thoughts on Trixie and it's two seconds long

3630
02:31:47,220 --> 02:31:50,260
So let's do it. Oh boy at three three two one go

3631
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:52,820
bullying works

3632
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:57,620
Bullying works through it does work true worked on jk rally

3633
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:04,100
Only centrist and cucks complain about bullying I would say

3634
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:10,820
Yeah, I would say bullying works in the sense that in this situation

3635
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:14,820
um having a a vocal force

3636
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:20,820
Calling Trixie out for the bullshit she was doing did lead to more people

3637
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:22,900
like

3638
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:25,940
Not caring anymore about her. I don't honestly

3639
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:32,980
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if if bullying and and and and anti stuff, you know

3640
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:37,300
People complaining about her being mean to her. I don't think that's really did anything

3641
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:39,700
Or I don't think it was the main the main thing is just people weren't

3642
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:42,100
weren't watching

3643
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:44,100
like sure but like

3644
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:46,260
the

3645
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:47,540
I feel like

3646
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:48,500
certain

3647
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,500
I feel like she would be doing better

3648
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:52,660
if there had been no like

3649
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,580
outrage

3650
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:56,580
like like publicly about

3651
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,500
stuff

3652
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:02,980
I think it was a factor it would have but I don't think it was it would have gone under the radar for a bunch of people

3653
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:06,660
And they would just be like wonder when the next video is and then they would watch it

3654
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:10,260
But she did yeah, I guess she did change her content so much

3655
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:15,860
The people just left anyway, so I don't know. I I think them. I think that's a

3656
02:33:16,580 --> 02:33:20,660
A relatively smaller there were there were definitely people that like got mad at her

3657
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:26,500
Decided they didn't like her anymore because of things she did or think she said or stuff like that, but I think

3658
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:31,780
In in the main it's just her content was different and and bad now

3659
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:33,380
and uh

3660
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:35,380
she was boring now and uh

3661
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:39,700
That's that's what people just yeah, that's just too. Yeah, I guess I guess

3662
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:47,140
Bullying works is just a generally true term for various things, but maybe not in this situation

3663
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:53,780
I mean at the end of the day if you're making videos people want to watch they'll they'll watch them even if they hate you

3664
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:55,940
You know

3665
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:58,900
Or a lot of people will people will watch things

3666
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:02,500
And that's that's the only thing that is true

3667
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:07,700
I'm willing to watch like an eight hour long video just to confirm my hate

3668
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:12,900
Exactly people do people do be watching people do be consuming content though

3669
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:17,060
And I'm willing to bet only I'm handful people have actually finished the video

3670
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:23,380
And so I'm in a secret club if you it sounds boring. It's like you beat um getting over it

3671
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:26,580
And you're in the secret forum

3672
02:34:27,620 --> 02:34:30,020
All right that with the ending of getting over is the secret form

3673
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:34,020
Yes, the secret form where people who have who have beaten the game can talk about

3674
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:37,060
How will they beat the game with other people who beat the game?

3675
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:40,100
You can hack in there, but like

3676
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:44,500
The reward obviously means nothing if you didn't try to get there legitimately

3677
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:48,420
I bet there were some I bet there were a bunch of smart Alex

3678
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:52,020
Who thought they were real clever who would go on there and be like I didn't beat the game

3679
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:54,500
I I found the link here somewhere ha ha

3680
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:57,460
I'm sullying your space

3681
02:34:57,540 --> 02:34:59,940
knowing that it was a it's the reward of

3682
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:04,260
Or I'm kind of basically like oh, I guess I don't want to finish reading the game now

3683
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:09,060
I mean I mean I think that's not it's that's not what it's about though. It's not about the reward

3684
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:12,180
No, and I think it's a cool like thing to do

3685
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:16,420
Because people would you know, they want to beat the game to get the cool prize

3686
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:21,380
Obviously the reward is that you feel like you've accomplished something and the

3687
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:28,020
The forum is just sort of like a little bonus for people who want to feel like exclusive

3688
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:34,980
What if what if like y'all what if if you beat the game y'all to know the reward is like an NFT of you beating the game

3689
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:38,900
Like a splash mountain take a picture, but an NFT

3690
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:45,620
Oh, yeah, like at disney. I started giving it an NFT. It's an NFT of you going on splash mountain

3691
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:48,820
There's no picture or anything. It's just like an NFT that says you went on the ride

3692
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:51,700
I

3693
02:35:54,580 --> 02:36:00,260
That tofu may be sick disgusting. I hated it. I hated every second of it and yet I ate all of it

3694
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:08,980
Uh, maybe that's why I'm feeling sick now. Maybe it's not the hangover coming back. Yeah castle like me and your mom last night

3695
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:16,660
What she made you sick she was disgusting and ate and I ate all of it and now

3696
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:21,700
I mean

3697
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:25,460
That's a bummer man. Um

3698
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:29,380
Oh, no, that's the last of the voicemails. Thank god

3699
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:34,260
No more of that. Okay. Well, there were technically two more voicemails that were just weekly reminded to play

3700
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:39,380
Ben's weekly reminded to play delta run chapter two and ben's weekly reminded to catch up on one piece

3701
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:44,020
I've already been. Oh, I I never finished chapter two. Oh

3702
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:48,260
Yeah, never even started it never even opened that shit. No, I

3703
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:50,900
Didn't I feel like chapter three is probably

3704
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:53,540
Coming out soon. It's been long enough

3705
02:36:53,940 --> 02:36:56,100
Yeah, any day now. Oh, maybe

3706
02:36:56,820 --> 02:37:00,500
Yeah, I missed I missed the train when everyone was drawing. Um, like

3707
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:03,220
NSFW are of queen

3708
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:07,140
Of queen. Oh, yeah queen, right? Yeah

3709
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:11,940
They should have given like a name like an actual name

3710
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:14,900
Yeah

3711
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:22,260
Oh, wait, people still draw spampton. I keep forgetting he's not either deltas. Yeah, spampton. Spampton's the new tumblr boy

3712
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:31,620
Is it is he or is that ironic? No, no people legitimately love him. He's great. He's a very funny character, but he also can be like

3713
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:37,700
Like uh, like a metaton-esque like uh tumblr sexy boy sexy man thing

3714
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:44,500
I I had two mutuals who like once spampton dropped they drew nothing but spampton

3715
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:49,540
Right, like that's all they fucking drew just spampton over and over again

3716
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:51,700
and

3717
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:53,700
Well, I don't

3718
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:58,180
I don't I don't get it. Well, of course you don't you haven't played the game

3719
02:37:58,340 --> 02:38:01,700
I haven't played the game. So, you know, what would I like? Why are all these people

3720
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:04,500
Caring about something? I don't know

3721
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:12,340
Who's the steven universe guy? What does he even do? Like what has he ever done for me hyper fixations be damn

3722
02:38:18,980 --> 02:38:20,980
Oh, I feel terrible

3723
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:31,060
This is my this is my my arc for this episode is I start out low and I just get lower I start out saying

3724
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:37,140
Uh, I'm hungover. Uh, I'm tired. Uh, I'm sick. Oh, I know I'll get I'll get Chinese food. Oh, but it's only made it worse

3725
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:44,500
I went through a whole I learned a lesson a valuable lesson don't buy Chinese food. Just don't do it

3726
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:46,900
Just don't do it msg

3727
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:49,780
um

3728
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:53,060
Got something good. Do you think you caught a little a little something?

3729
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:55,700
coronavirus

3730
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,980
baby

3731
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:02,020
No, although, uh, some people I know were exposed to it recently

3732
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:07,620
So there's I have to I was I was like third hand exposed to covid

3733
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:10,100
So I have to test myself in a couple days

3734
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:15,780
But I think I think I'm probably in a clear because none of those people actually like got sick. So I probably won't either

3735
02:39:16,660 --> 02:39:24,980
I um, I got covid back like at the start of august and it really fucking like set back everything I was working on

3736
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:31,780
Yeah, if anyone sees me on twitter, it says like working on five comics and I just say that

3737
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:35,220
A lot of stuff was supposed to come out a lot earlier, but um

3738
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:40,660
It's fucking yeah, I couldn't do anything and coincidentally on the same day that um

3739
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:45,700
I got covid my computer crashed so hard. I needed to reinstall windows

3740
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:50,900
And when I reinstalled it, um, it deleted a bunch of my old files

3741
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:58,260
Including close including the episode of main character syndrome. I recorded that same day

3742
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:00,500
No

3743
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:03,940
Which was uh, yolo swag studios without berries and cream

3744
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:08,580
And really that's a week. Oh, yeah, that sucks so much

3745
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:15,780
Yeah, exactly. So I have to like get back on being ahead of myself with fucking main character syndrome

3746
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:18,020
um

3747
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:20,020
and I was supposed to

3748
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:26,340
Um, there was a kickstart campaign. I was supposed to start but now um, it's gonna start later this month actually

3749
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:29,220
You guys have you guys seen my post about that?

3750
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:33,780
Uh, no, I don't think so. Was it uh, is it an s of w?

Am I an s of w account have anyway?

3760
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:17,380
Probably not too much

3761
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:23,780
Yeah, not too much, but um, yeah the the people involved is just it's me and two other guys

02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:28,660
And um, it's uh, it's galacta b and superspo

You guys know those guys I had seen I had seen them around I'd seen their

3764
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:37,460
Before I recognize both of them. I I do not

02:41:38,420 --> 02:41:40,420
I have not heard of those

3766

Um superspo is a buddy of mine and van actually has mentioned his like stuff on um

3767
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:50,420
On the pcp before

3768
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:53,380
And um, he mostly does like very like

3769
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:55,460
like uh

3770
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:57,460
Like obese women commissions

3771
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:00,660
Um score

Kind of look for

3774
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:09,780
Ellie is already I'm gonna put none of this on because some of it is very suggestive, but um

3775
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:13,140
We already showed that picture of gib

3776
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:16,260
On top of me as harco

3777
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:19,060
Yeah, exactly

3778
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:24,340
Man sure sure was problematic for that adult harco to fucking hit on and

3779
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:27,060

02:42:57,620 --> 02:42:59,620

Well, I know you changed your twitter your twitter profile or your your pfp

02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:50,200
Um, the positive that all the positive clown accounts have been dormant although recently i've been like posting to kind of like

3798
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:56,760
You know like, you know rally up some interests. I know you've been doing uh, you've been doing my alien girlfriend

3799
02:43:57,480 --> 02:43:59,080
Yes, and

3800
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:01,400
Yeah, so you haven't really you haven't been clown posting

3801
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:04,440
I've been clown posting in a while

3802
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:05,880
um, I

3803
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:09,000
I've been on uh, I also like um after

3804
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:13,160
I I mean if anyone reads my alien girlfriend, you might have noticed that um

3805
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:19,160
It's mostly just been guest artists right now because my computer even though I reinstalled windows

3806
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:21,320
There was like a bigger issue my computer had

3807
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:29,320
And um, my my usual tech guy my usual buddy who comes my buddy who actually built that computer for me after that um

3808
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:32,520
Go fund me. I I ran. Um

3809
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:38,440
Has been ghosting me like he just won't talk to me at all like I've been DMing him on everything

3810
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:43,240
I've been DMing him for weeks and he's just not I don't know what I did. Maybe I fucking offended him

3811
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,240
or something

3812
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:49,080
Yeah, so I so I had to go to I actually had to go to a professional

3813
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:51,720
The funny thing is that I even DM him told him that I could pay him

3814
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:53,800
to like

3815
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:59,400
Take a look at the computer and like, you know fix it, but um, he just was not interested so I went to um

3816
02:45:00,040 --> 02:45:01,960
actual tech guys

3817
02:45:01,960 --> 02:45:06,120
And that happened like two weeks ago. So now my computer is up and running again

3818
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:08,200
Um

3819
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:14,680
I'm gonna go back to fucking drawing my alien girlfriend and we're not gonna have guest artists for a good while now actually

3820
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:21,560
Speaking of oh, yeah, no go on. Yeah. No, we're gonna say I was gonna say speaking of

3821
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:24,840
Things that happened that delay kick starters

3822
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:27,560
That just reminds me about how yet

3823
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:29,480
I have not checked

3824
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:32,040
Did I mention that the the chinese company lady

3825
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:36,600
Ghosted me about like printing my book like we freaking had worked

3826
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:41,400
Out a whole bunch of stuff about how to print the book and then like when i'm finally ready to like order it

3827
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:46,760
She just like stops responding. I think you mentioned that but I would have assumed she got back to you by now

3828
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:51,800
You know what I have not checked in a few days. Maybe she did in the last week and I just haven't seen it

3829
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:53,800
But she didn't like three weeks

3830
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:57,080
Worst case scenario worst case scenario should fucking die

3831
02:45:58,600 --> 02:45:59,880
I

3832
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:05,080
Yeah, I gotta check may it's possible. Maybe she'll have gotten back. Isn't that would be a really big relief

3833
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:09,960
I don't know if this is still happening, but isn't it like in china? They're on full lockdown or something

3834
02:46:10,120 --> 02:46:12,120
Like they're not even allowed to leave their apartments

3835
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:13,800
Um

3836
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:19,560
I and what are they think about that that that was like, uh, that was like a couple months ago. I remember

3837
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:23,240
Like they just weren't allowed and they were they would get arrested if they

3838
02:46:25,480 --> 02:46:29,480
I mean, yeah, I know they had really strict like lockdown stuff over there

3839
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:32,520
I mean, I don't think it was the whole country and like I mean, how long

3840
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,320
Could they keep that up?

3841
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:38,120
How long can they keep the lie up?

3842
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:41,160
Yeah, the the covid lie. Yeah, how long could we lie?

3843
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:43,880
Yeah

3844
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:49,480
Oh, I was gonna ask you Ben. Um, do you know, do you know what's the percentage number that like Kickstarter takes from

3845
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:55,640
Your campaign? I think it's something like 10 10 percent or nine percent or something like that

3846
02:46:56,200 --> 02:47:02,040
I would have to look it up. That's what I figured. It's it's around there. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, yeah, I gotta

3847
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:06,760
I gotta crunch the numbers. I mean, I crunched the majority of them already like

3848
02:47:07,720 --> 02:47:12,920
Before the Kickstarter, I have like a rough estimate about like how much the Kickstarter should be

3849
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:15,640
What what what are your estimates?

3850
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:20,840
Um, it's probably gonna be a little over

3851
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:24,120
10,000

3852
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:28,280
For the Kickstarter. Yeah. Yeah, because each because each artist, um

3853
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:35,480
The the the whole idea of the real goal of the Kickstarter was to get three months in my rent paid

3854
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:41,480
Right, right. That's the real goal, right and each artist is going to get like three thousand

3855
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:47,800
And um the comics are each one of our comics is between 15 to 20 pages

3856
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:55,640
Um, and I and I kind of picked three thousand at random because one of one of my buddies suggested it because they talked about like

3857
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:58,520
Oh, yeah, this should cover grant for like

3858
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:02,840
Uh, a handful of months and I'm like, oh, yeah, I could just

3859
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:10,920
Since I since I could just treat it as like the the anthology is like the employee the employer and

3860
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:15,960
I I run it. So I just get to the side. I'm gonna get fucking paid, right?

3861
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:18,280
I guess so

3862
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:19,400
I mean

3863
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:22,440
That's one way to think about it. Yeah, and so everyone's getting

3864
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:24,360
3000

3865
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:26,360
And we're gonna try to print a hundred books

3866
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:30,600
A hundred books for a ten thousand dollars

3867
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:34,600
Yeah, see it seems wait, how big are these books?

3868
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:38,600
Uh, the books are like 60 pages

3869
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:46,600
How much is one gonna cost how much is one gonna cost? Yeah, I was thinking like maybe around 25 to 35

3870
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:48,600
Okay

3871
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:50,600
Yeah, how does that add up to $10,000?

3872
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:53,000
Oh, no the print. No the printing company

3873
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:58,360
Okay, wait the print company for for a hundred books is gonna charge like around 700

3874
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:03,720
Okay, I'm just saying. All right, but if your goal is to sell a hundred books and

3875
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:11,160
Is you're selling them for 25 dollars a piece? That's 2,500 dollars. That's not 10,000 dollars

3876
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:13,960
Okay, so

3877
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:16,520
Okay, so

3878
02:49:17,080 --> 02:49:19,080
Okay, so

3879
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:23,160
Let's see how the word this did not sound like I'm an idiot. I guess

3880
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:25,720
Okay, so it's it's it's like

3881
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:28,520
For just to pay the artist, right?

3882
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:35,960
And like 700 to print out like 100 books and the the thing is that like there's there's no guarantee

3883
02:49:36,040 --> 02:49:40,120
Like we're gonna have like a tee like it's gonna we're gonna print out a hundred of them

3884
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:42,680
But the idea is that like

3885
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:44,680
You reserve a copy

3886
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:46,920
From a certain tier that you pay for right?

3887
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:49,880
Yeah

3888
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:51,880
So

3889
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:55,160
Yeah, and like so what's like how does that add up? How does that make 10,000?

3890
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:58,120
Well, we also have shipping

3891
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:03,400
For shipping is gonna be to ship out like a hundred books. It's gonna be like over 500

3892
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:06,280
And then we got a lot of envelopes

3893
02:50:06,280 --> 02:50:10,120
Doug give am I am I failing to communicate something?

3894
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:13,180
They mentioned the artist was nine grand

3895
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:16,360
Okay, which is the bulk of it. I

3896
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:19,880
I'm not I'm not I'm not saying I'm not saying you should not

3897
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,600
No, I'm not saying like you should not

3898
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:24,360
Uh

3899
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:29,320
Get that much what I'm saying is if you sell a hundred books at 25

3900
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:35,000
Dollars a piece that doesn't that doesn't make 10,000. We're not we're not we're not selling the hundred books

3901
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
We're printing a hundred books

3902
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:39,080
So you're selling less than a hundred books

3903
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:43,480
So it's even what how does that make that doesn't get you 10,000 dollars?

3904
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:50,920
All right, am I am I losing my mind? Well, I think ben you're you're thinking like uh

3905
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:54,600
People on the Kickstarter will pay just for the book

3906
02:50:55,240 --> 02:51:03,560
I feel like there's probably tiers of like higher cost. There's there's tiers. Yes. We're like certain tiers reserve you a copy of those 100

3907
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,240
Right

3908
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:06,600
Ryan

3909
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:07,560
Yeah

3910
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:11,880
So we're gonna we're printing out a hundred, but there's no guarantee that all 100

3911
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:16,360
They're not gonna they're not all gonna be sold sold during the Kickstarter

3912
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:20,200
The idea that is like I'm gonna have like a supply of these books to sell for out

3913
02:51:21,880 --> 02:51:23,880
I

3914
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:30,120
I feel so when you use when you go to the Kickstarter and you say I would like I would like to support this

3915
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:31,480
I would like a book

3916
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:34,120
There's no guarantee you will get a book. There's people who would

3917
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:36,920
There's people who will support it

3918
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:42,520
And they're not gonna like I mean I there's gonna be like a I think the lowest you can get is like a digital copy

3919
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:45,560
Right for one of the tiers, right?

3920
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:46,680
Okay

3921
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:50,440
Yeah, and then like and there's gonna be another tier that reserves you a physical copy

3922
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:53,400
So, okay, so you're expecting

3923
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:57,960
Okay, so you're expecting there's gonna be people who are gonna support and they're not gonna get a book out of it

3924
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:00,440
Okay, yeah, I

3925
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:02,520
I get okay. I guess I get it

3926
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:07,480
Do you think do you think that most people will support it but not buy a book?

3927
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:12,120
Um, well, that's where I like I'm like kind of like if you about it

3928
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:16,120
I think the majority people would want a book like they're gonna reserve for I mean, yeah

3929
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:20,200
I would think I would think that like the standard backer it like would pledge

3930
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
To get the book

3931
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:25,160
Yeah

3932
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:28,760
Right, but I don't but I think charging like what like, um

3933
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:32,280
25,000

3934
02:52:32,360 --> 02:52:38,280
That's like that's a trick every two thousand. No, it'd be 2,500. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it'd be 2,500

3935
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:43,240
If if a hundred if a hundred people buy a book for 25 dollars, that's 2,500

3936
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:45,800
Right, but there's no guarantee that we're gonna get a hundred

3937
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:50,840
Yes, and what I'm saying is that that means that

3938
02:52:51,400 --> 02:52:54,760
We're not is that the figure that that gets you to is not ten thousand dollar

3939
02:52:55,480 --> 02:53:01,080
What I'm that's what I'm saying give you understand what I'm you're saying that if you sell them at 25

3940
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:03,160
And that's the tier that gets you the book

3941
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:07,880
I'm saying I'm saying the number the numbers it sounds the numbers it sounds like you were expecting to do

3942
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:15,160
The numbers it sounds like you're expecting to do do not yield the the result that you are suggesting

3943
02:53:16,520 --> 02:53:20,760
I don't know. Okay. Uh, well, there's like I mean, there's still other things that are like

3944
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:26,200
I'm included into it like, you know, like not just shipping but at the order a bunch of envelopes

3945
02:53:27,640 --> 02:53:32,360
And also like you know, that's not you fool you fool. I'm not that's not what I'm saying

3946
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:36,760
I'm not saying I'm not saying no your expenses. Don't justify it. I'm saying

3947
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:42,680
How do you plan to make that money? I'm saying that a hundred people buying the book doesn't

3948
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:45,720
Make doesn't make the money that you're saying it makes

3949
02:53:47,240 --> 02:53:49,240
So I gotta charge them off with the book

3950
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:52,200
No, I mean, I would say you would either have to

3951
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:56,040
Got what what do I think? Well, here here's what I think

3952
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:00,920
I mean, depending on how like if you if you don't expect to sell that many if you're any expecting to like

3953
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:04,120
Hypothetically sell a hundred on it if you're lucky

3954
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:06,600
um

3955
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:08,600
And you need ten grand for that

3956
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:16,760
Uh, that's gonna be difficult unless all of the people are willing to pledge large amounts of money for each book

3957
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:18,760
Yeah

3958
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:21,480
It would if you're if you're if it's possible to sell

3959
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:27,880
Um, there is gonna be there is gonna be a tier higher. There is gonna be a tier higher than like

3960
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:30,280
The physical book

3961
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:33,480
Yeah, sure, right there's gonna be like more tiers

3962
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:36,440
It's gonna be a little bit more like incentivization

3963
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:43,000
I think if because like the the printing of the books is relatively small of a cost compared to paying the artists

3964
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:45,240
I feel like it wouldn't be

3965
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:47,880
Like too bad to try and print 200 books

3966
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:50,440
Or like more. Yeah

3967
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:53,480
Yeah, so that there are more books to go around so that more people

3968
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:56,200
can pledge

3969
02:54:56,440 --> 02:55:00,120
For a book and potentially a higher tier of the book

3970
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:05,400
All right, you know what now that's starting to make a lot more sense

3971
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:12,360
Okay, now that makes a lot more sense about like the the more volume you have the more of the higher tiers you can get

3972
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:18,280
Therefore, you'll be easier to get at all. No, I get you because like I um

3973
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:22,040
I did watch other people talk about this and they say like yeah

3974
02:55:22,120 --> 02:55:26,920
I usually order like 200 or 300 and I never I never knew why people would order that much

3975
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:29,400
I just feel like wouldn't like 100 just be enough

3976
02:55:29,880 --> 02:55:32,840
But like now I see what you mean. Well, I mean you should like because I would

3977
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:39,880
Yeah, the whole I think that you wouldn't that you wouldn't decide how many copies you were going to print until after the Kickstarter

3978
02:55:39,960 --> 02:55:43,160
It was done and you like knew how many orders you needed to fulfill, right?

3979
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:49,080
I mean, yeah, and then that that would like

3980
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:51,720
Make the

3981
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:55,400
I mean that would make the the cost of the Kickstarter like lower, right?

3982
02:55:56,360 --> 02:55:57,560
Um

3983
02:55:57,560 --> 02:56:03,560
Slightly, I mean if you're paying the artist's nine thousand and that is how much it costs then

3984
02:56:04,360 --> 02:56:09,960
That is a fixed fee that they're gonna need that money for the art that you're doing but the number of books

3985
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:12,760
Uh needed to print

3986
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:17,560
It's like the larger like it's it's not as expensive to get a larger amount of books

3987
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:19,720
And it is to pay more artists, you know

3988
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:25,320
The the tier the tier for the for the book for the physical book would have to go up a little bit

3989
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:32,680
We'll have to go up to match like the shipping and the and the envelope and like the labor cost of packaging the stuff, right?

3990
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:35,240
I mean, doesn't it all does it not already include that?

3991
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:44,120
Um, no, it's yeah, it is included. It's just that it's it's it's all all that is included. I just don't have it at um 100 books

3992
02:56:46,120 --> 02:56:48,120
Why 100 books?

3993
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:50,280
Okay, because the the idea was

3994
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:55,880
That like a lot I I sell a lot of the stuff. I I do like vending that convention. So I would sell it

3995
02:56:56,520 --> 02:57:03,400
Yeah, or like if people will set up some sort of shop where people could like order it later on like let's say that like

3996
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:07,320
During the Kickstarter people don't have like the money to like buy a copy

3997
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:10,600
But like I don't have a lot to like sell for the course of the year

3998
02:57:11,160 --> 02:57:15,000
Right and of course like of course all the artists are gonna get a percentage of the sales, right?

3999
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:17,640
Yeah

4000
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
So why so why a hundred?

4001
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:24,120
I mean, it just seemed like a reasonable number

4002
02:57:24,760 --> 02:57:28,840
Okay, uh, so the the goal is to have overstock so that you'll have

4003
02:57:29,320 --> 02:57:33,000
Stock left over that you can sell. I mean because if you have overstock

4004
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:36,440
You could you could sell the book for like cheaper because you're gonna sell it in person, right?

4005
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:38,440
That's that's why more people to buy it. Yeah

4006
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,040
So is a hundred a hundred is like the minimum you want to print

4007
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:45,240
I'm just thinking like what if you so what if you sell 200 books?

4008
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:49,160
What if the Kickstarter is a big success and 200 people that buy the book then you would print 200, right?

4009
02:57:49,640 --> 02:57:52,760
I'm gonna have to grab a quote right now or you would print more

4010
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:55,160
Yeah, um

4011
02:57:55,160 --> 02:58:01,080
Yeah, if if it's like a huge ass success, we're gonna like, you know, like if people like, um

4012
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:07,080
If people pay for the tier where they get the physical book, they're gonna like they're gonna get a they're gonna get a book

4013
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:09,080
We're just gonna like raise the number of orders, right?

4014
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:16,520
Yeah, well, I'm saying if you sell a lot of books if it's this big success then you can buy

4015
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:19,160
a bigger print run

4016
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:23,000
And that will yield that will lead to the cost per copy going down

4017
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:27,800
Uh, if you if you buy more at a time, right, right?

4018
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:31,400
Uh, so what what point what point was I trying to make there?

4019
02:58:32,040 --> 02:58:37,160
I think I was I was a bit confused because I thought you you said there's going to be a hundred and

4020
02:58:37,880 --> 02:58:41,720
That will pay for the 10 grand 10 grand

4021
02:58:42,920 --> 02:58:44,520
like goal

4022
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:49,240
When it's more likely that you would need more than a hundred people buying the book

4023
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:51,720
to get that high

4024
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:59,080
Yeah, unless the almost the special tier is like, uh, pay 500 dollars and you get the super special golden book

4025
02:58:59,800 --> 02:59:05,000
Unless yeah, unless you expect like that like a majority of the money would be going to yeah

4026
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:08,360
Some other tier that either like doesn't include a book or

4027
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:12,600
Includes like a lot is something else. It's a much higher tier that includes a book

4028
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:15,640
But also a bunch of other stuff like if you think that's where most of the money is going to come from

4029
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:20,520
Yeah, this is gonna this is going to be a big dummy thing to say, but I didn't realize that

4030
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:23,320
Oh, yeah, the majority of people would want a physical copy, right?

4031
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:26,760
Yeah

4032
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:28,760
That's what I'm driving at

4033
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:34,760
Well, that's well, no, no, no, you're right. I mean, this is why it helps that I say this out of the open

4034
02:59:34,760 --> 02:59:38,040
I just don't want no one in the comment section to to bully me

4035
02:59:38,680 --> 02:59:42,360
Okay, well, sorry, but it's too late. It's too late

4036
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:46,440
Okay, um

4037
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:50,840
Yeah, uh, no, yeah, I should I should you're right. I should be like order enough that like it

4038
02:59:51,080 --> 02:59:54,360
It would cover for the fucking kickstart. Yeah, I would I would right now

4039
02:59:54,920 --> 02:59:57,560
The way that I the way that I did mine is I

4040
02:59:58,120 --> 03:00:00,120
Yeah, like I thought I planned like, okay

4041
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:03,640
What's the minimum number of copies that I would want to make and then I'm like, okay

4042
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:05,720
I'll set the price at that level

4043
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:11,320
And then if it sells more than that then I can print then I print more and that actually like reduces

4044
03:00:11,880 --> 03:00:15,240
Costs actually it actually makes each copy sold more

4045
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:19,000
Profitable because the the cost per copy goes down if you print a bigger run

4046
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:22,760
I can't remember how I figured out my load of ghosts one

4047
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:24,200
I think

4048
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:28,200
All of the different things like the plush and the pins and everything made it more complicated

4049
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:33,640
Like if you like if your goal is to make ten thousand dollars, then I guess you would say like, okay

4050
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:38,760
Well, each book is gonna chart cost 25. So I hope need to sell. What would be 500?

4051
03:00:39,240 --> 03:00:40,840
What would be 500?

4052
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:42,840
copies and that would be like

4053
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
I mean you would probably make

4054
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:47,320
Yeah, there will there will be people that pledge

4055
03:00:47,720 --> 03:00:50,680
Hire without buying the book and there will be people that pledge at higher tiers

4056
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:55,160
So it may end up to be sort of in the middle like 350 books you need to print

4057
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:58,040
Yeah

4058
03:00:58,040 --> 03:01:00,040
In order to cover all the expenses

4059
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:05,080
Pay all the artists get all the money for us sending things out the envelopes and stuff

4060
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:12,760
Because relatively purchasing lots of books and envelopes is a lot less expensive than paying for art

4061
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:15,240
To be made

4062
03:01:15,240 --> 03:01:16,120
Yeah

4063
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:21,480
Hey, what happened? Hey, what happened to that a comic that I executive produced?

4064
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:26,120
Oh, maybe you're still working on it. Still working on it. Okay. Yeah

Yeah, cringe. It is

4067
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:36,680
It is cringe. I mean

4068
03:01:36,920 --> 03:01:41,160
Like like I like we'll we'll figure something out. I have um

4069
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:48,840
What does she need a job for when I'm generous generously funding her her her her project when I'm when I'm executive

03:01:52,440 --> 03:01:55,880
I can get her a rap gig in Elko, Nevada. Like what I can do. I can give you everything

4072
03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:59,160
We had everything it all ran like clockwork, but you had to fuck it up

4073
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:04,920
Yeah, little do we know she has her own little ben saint destroying her career

4074
03:02:07,240 --> 03:02:10,520
Um, I'm a producer. I'm a big money connection

4075
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:13,240

03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:55,800
With a beetle moses. Yeah, we'll be the Moses. They had a boshan and turkey tom

4088
03:02:57,320 --> 03:02:59,080
I saw they had um

4089
03:02:59,080 --> 03:03:03,400
No, no, it's the one after the other. I saw they had young krip on I saw that

4090
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:07,480
That was like the recent episode. I saw a clip of that

4091
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:11,720
Uh, I haven't I mean I haven't actually watched the podcast or anything

4092
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:15,800
But I am aware of it. I didn't know how long it had been going on

4093
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:18,280
Good for them

4094
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:22,520
I imagine having like like inviting notable people onto your show

4095
03:03:23,240 --> 03:03:26,200
Imagine how scary that would be imagine if they they have an audience

4096
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,440
um

4097
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:30,440
Can't believe anyone would do that

4098
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:33,240
I is a scary is this a

4099
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:35,560
Is a bit

4100
03:03:35,560 --> 03:03:37,400
it's like the

4101
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:38,520
Hmm

4102
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:41,240
How much would you pay for 60 pages of porno?

4103
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:43,320
and comments for

4104
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:45,320
Clown related to them related

4105
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:48,200
porno, I mean

4106
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:54,120
If it's like an indie thing that's like that i'm kick starting that that means I would pay more for it than if I would for like

4107
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:59,240
Something that I saw in a store. I mean the artists here look very good. I think 25 dollars

4108
03:03:59,880 --> 03:04:01,880
25 to 30. Yeah

4109
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:06,840
Okay, I uh, yeah, I'm hoping I'm hoping that

4110
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:09,480
Slime and punishment will only cost

4111
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:12,300
Something around like 25 or 30 dollars

4112
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:14,760
uh

4113
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:21,720
To that's going to depend on it literally depends on whether this stupid lady gets back to me because her printing was the cheapest

4114
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:26,280
And that was going to make the book cost what I wanted it to cost if I go with someone else that might have to cost more

4115
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:28,280
And I and I really don't want that

4116
03:04:28,600 --> 03:04:30,600
um

4117
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:32,680
I get that

4118
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:38,280
I gotta keep gotta keep those costs low. You gotta pass that savings on to the consumer, baby

4119
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:41,960
God, I'm so done. I never want to make a physical comic

4120
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:48,520
Ever again. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait to uh, I mean, I'm I'm planning to do like

4121
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:51,800
kick one kick start kick start after another

4122
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:53,880
right now

4123
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:56,440
As as an effort to like keep paying my fucking rent

4124
03:04:57,080 --> 03:04:59,480
I will be very excited if the if the

4125
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:02,440
Slime and punishment sees I'll be really hype

4126
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:07,480
I'll be really hyped to get a bunch of books and put them in get a bunch of boxes and put them in boxes and do it hundreds

4127
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:12,360
Hundreds and hundreds of boxes again kind of like the if it's anything like the vapors

4128
03:05:12,520 --> 03:05:15,000
It'll be like that, but it'll be much harder

4129
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:21,560
Because I'll have to fold boxes, but I'll do it because uh, I love my fans so much

4130
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:25,080
You kiss each envelope over them. Mm-hmm

4131
03:05:25,560 --> 03:05:26,360
But I'll put a little yes

4132
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:28,680
I'll put a little smiley face just like just like spongebob

4133
03:05:29,080 --> 03:05:32,520
Making that making that crabby patty in the in the cookoff against Neptune

4134
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:37,960
When he put the little smiley faces on the on the pickles and he and he covered them a cheese blank and gave him a little kiss

4135
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:40,040
That's me putting together

4136
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:44,680
My Kickstarter reward boxes, uh, when you buy things from me

4137
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:46,840

4144
03:06:12,120 --> 03:06:14,120
Oh, I didn't see the whole thing ones are gonna look like this

4145
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:20,440
They're gonna they're gonna they're gonna look like this. These are like eight by eleven, which is a very like weird

4146
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:27,480
It's kind of when it the the site that I'm using doesn't have that as in like default option

4147
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:32,280
You have to like custom it and I just kind of chose that because like I'm already drawing it by a by 11

4148
03:06:33,240 --> 03:06:34,600
because like

4149
03:06:34,600 --> 03:06:36,600
So are like the villain verse copies

4150
03:06:37,240 --> 03:06:43,720
Yeah, I was going through my bookshelves during the move and I I found my villain verse books and I

4151
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:46,440
Carefully tucked them away friggin uh

4152
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,720
Well, the lord yeah, not only did the lord of ghosts

03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:58,760
Uh, I drop I dropped the uh lord of ghosts book and it creased the cover for a minute

4155
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:04,040
I managed to I managed to uncrease it and it looks fine, but like oh no the structural integrity

4156
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:09,320
It could easily it could happen again. It could happen again, and then it might not be uncreasible

4157
03:07:10,120 --> 03:07:12,120
no

4158
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:13,960
Oh the structural integrity

4159
03:07:13,960 --> 03:07:19,720
Oh gotta protect that gotta protect that book structural integrity. There's only one. It's my it's the autograph

4160
03:07:19,720 --> 03:07:24,360
That's got the little phantom horn virginia inside of it. That's one of a kind

4161
03:07:25,720 --> 03:07:27,720
Collector's head

4162
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:32,280
Oh

4163
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:40,280

4166
03:07:51,960 --> 03:07:53,960
Really? Yeah

4167
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:58,280
Uh, I mean you could yeah, I mean sure I mean what I what I did is that

4168
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:04,760
The the the size of your donation to the Kickstarter increases the font size in the back

4169
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:08,520
Of of don't so I did that's what I did

4170
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:11,640
So wait how much pledged at all get a little mention

4171
03:08:12,200 --> 03:08:15,960
And then people who pledge big have huge letters and they're so cool

4172
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:20,440
Well, cheesy you have um in in one of those villain verses i'm

4174
03:08:25,240 --> 03:08:29,240
How much I don't remember how much it cost me it was um, I think it was I think it was

4175
03:08:29,720 --> 03:08:34,360
How much you pay me on patreon although like I kind of I kind of changed that now so like

4176

4178
03:08:42,840 --> 03:08:46,440
I like I like raised up the amount you need to pay me to keep you on that page

4179
03:08:47,400 --> 03:08:48,600
Yeah

4180
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:53,400
I would say like yeah something like that for someone that pledges like a hundred bucks or whatever

4181
03:08:54,120 --> 03:08:58,440
And then and then maybe a page of thank yous with everyone in a little little name

4195
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:55,640
Which is sort of a thing in porn

4196
03:09:55,880 --> 03:10:00,040
You could once here is like if you pledge a thousand dollars like I'll put your face on the generic

4197
03:10:00,040 --> 03:10:02,520
I'll do all your face on your copy. Yeah

4198
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:09,160
Uh, maybe for the next one. I'll do something like that. That's a pretty funny. Well, the thing is that I do that in my story

4199
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:13,560
Yeah, my my story my comic is pov style

03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:27,160
Like an outline on the page saying place penis here for maximum immersion

4203
03:10:27,640 --> 03:10:33,160
It's like it's like the page is like a little dotted line outline. Yeah place penis on page

Yes, or maybe I should um

4212
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:12,920

All right, I need to I need to go to the bathroom really quick. I'll be back in a minute. Sorry

03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
Ben has never seen again

4225
03:11:57,400 --> 03:12:01,960
Ben died he shit himself to death just like Elvis. He shit and he puked

4226
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:08,760
And it all of the liquids left his body at the same time and he turned to dust and he flew away

4227
03:12:09,880 --> 03:12:11,880
Uh, again could I ask you a question?

4228
03:12:12,680 --> 03:12:13,720
Yes

4229
03:12:13,720 --> 03:12:15,720
If you had the power

4230
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:17,400
to turn

4231
03:12:17,400 --> 03:12:20,360
One random woman in the world into like

4232
03:12:21,160 --> 03:12:23,560
A giant like amoeba slime

4233
03:12:24,840 --> 03:12:27,880
That just doesn't think or anything. He just turned into slime instantly

4234
03:12:28,760 --> 03:12:30,760
Which woman would you pick?

4235
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:36,200
So like I choose a woman and she turns into a non-thinking giant slime woman

4236
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:43,720
She turned into an amoeba basically like a human size amoeba, but it's like a slime. It's like slime. It's like

4237
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:49,880
You basically turn into a blob and she doesn't she doesn't like think it's like a non-thinking

4238
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:53,880
I mean why would I want to do that 21? That sounds horrible

4239
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:01,880
Okay, but if you had to choose I was like if you if I had to if I had to turn one

4240
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:09,480
Um, Liz trust the the hopeful conservative leader of the the fucking tory party

4241
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:14,120
I turned her into a blob. I would pick Nancy Pelosi. I think as

4242
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:18,120
To turn her to turn into a slime like in the middle versus a speech

4243
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:22,840
I think that'd be the perfect time like because people will see and people will freak the fuck out

4244
03:13:24,600 --> 03:13:27,160
See that's the reason it'd be so fucking cool. Oh

4245
03:13:28,520 --> 03:13:31,720
Well, because it'll be like you'll be good fucking riddance, you know

4246
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:35,480
It's like the death noble with slime instead of instead of death you turn into

4247
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:37,480
slime

4248
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:40,680
The slime now

4249
03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:49,320
I'm just imagining that the the the the death note like anime where he's writing furiously in the pen

4250
03:13:49,960 --> 03:13:55,720
And instead of watching all of the prisoners get heart attacks. They just turn into slime and explode splatter everywhere

4251
03:13:56,440 --> 03:13:58,440
It's just so goofy

4252
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:02,360
What's that? I want I wish I knew what the japanese word for slime was

4253
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,880
And they just start calling instead of kira. They start calling him that

4254
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:07,480
Gooper

4255
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:11,400
Gooper the gooper strikes. This is el's most deadliest

4256
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:16,520
Case yet. Who is goopie with an a g o o p a

4257
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:21,800
I used to I used to know a girl back in middle school named kira

4258
03:14:22,760 --> 03:14:23,960
um

4259
03:14:23,960 --> 03:14:28,200
She was like asian and um, did she have a death note? No

4260
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:30,920
Dang

4261
03:14:31,720 --> 03:14:33,720
Crippling depression

4262
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:36,360
Jk, that's not true. I don't know

4263
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:40,200
I don't know about that

4264
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:41,240
um

4265
03:14:41,240 --> 03:14:46,920
I think I might I think for the Kickstarter might stick it for like just depending how many people like pledge that's how many I'll order

4266
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:52,440
Yeah, like just have it open as like a tear because

4267
03:14:53,640 --> 03:14:55,640
um presuming that

4268
03:14:55,960 --> 03:14:57,960
This is what I did for a lot of ghosts. I would

4269
03:14:58,600 --> 03:15:00,360
figure out like

4270
03:15:00,360 --> 03:15:04,200
Roughly how much a single book would cost to create

4271
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,160
It's usually gonna be less than 25

4272
03:15:07,720 --> 03:15:09,720
bucks if you're making a hundred of them

4273
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:12,040
um, but just check so that

4274
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:14,600
You have the tear that gets the book

4275
03:15:15,320 --> 03:15:16,760
the lowest tear

4276
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:20,440
And just make sure that one pledge to that tear will cover the cost

4277
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:24,520
And and mailing of that book so that doesn't matter how many

4278
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:28,200
pledges you get you can still cover all the costs at the end

4279
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:32,760
That makes sense

4280
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:35,640
I think um

4281
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:39,720
Yeah, I'm gonna have to really zone in and like pick a number here

4282
03:15:40,600 --> 03:15:43,880
Number munchin was really stressful for me

4283
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:51,080
But it wasn't very important because if I didn't number munch, I wouldn't know how high to put the goal or where the stretch goal should go

4284
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:55,240
I don't think it would have worked if I didn't think about it a lot

4285
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:59,480
No, I got you. I need to I I kind of have

4286
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:03,160
I'm gonna all I have is like two weeks

4287
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:06,040
to like uh figure this out

4288
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:13,400
And I don't want like I don't want anyone to get screwed. I already promised everyone like 3000 and I think 3000 is um

4289
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:19,320
A decent amount. I think I think some artists get paid more than 3000 like

4290
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:22,040
At at a professional industry level

4291
03:16:22,840 --> 03:16:24,280
Oh, yeah, I mean

4292
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:25,240
yeah

4293
03:16:25,240 --> 03:16:27,800
mass producing comics is so

4294
03:16:29,160 --> 03:16:31,160
It's so like difficult

4295
03:16:31,560 --> 03:16:34,680
Uh, which is why it's not done on an indie scale quite so much

4296
03:16:35,720 --> 03:16:38,440
I'm I mean my my dream is that um

4297
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:45,000
If this gets like popular enough that I get approached by some like publisher

4298
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:47,320
and um

4299
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:49,320
They could handle like

4300
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:57,880
Um printing out future volumes and then yeah, the next Kickstarter would be like half as cheap

4301
03:16:58,680 --> 03:17:01,080
Yeah, that's that's what I'm hoping for

4302
03:17:01,960 --> 03:17:07,560
Not that not that I I I might try another Kickstarter for like the Clarissa gunsmoak when I finish that

4303
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:12,360
And be like hey, it's a cowgirl. I'm gonna make a this is my other comic

4304
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:15,560
and maybe

4305
03:17:15,960 --> 03:17:19,480
I feel like if I have that I don't need to do a Kickstarter to

4306
03:17:20,040 --> 03:17:23,320
Try and get it published. I could go to publishers and say look at my work

4307
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:27,320
They'll probably say nah who cares, but if I do have a Kickstarter, I guess

4308
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:31,480
I can say well, I got this many sales. So

4309
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:36,840
What are you gonna do about that? It's uh, it's really tough right now to like get anything like

4310
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:41,720
Like printed because there's like like a paper shortage and um

4311
03:17:42,680 --> 03:17:47,800
A lot of these industries are still recovered from the I mean, they're very ones I could cover from the pandemic

4312
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:50,920
and um

4313
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:53,800
Like I'm gonna say um back when I interned they

4314
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:56,680
I noticed that um

4315
03:17:57,080 --> 03:17:59,960
A handful of like the things they published

4316
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:04,840
Like um had kick starters and I the idea is that you kick start

4317
03:18:05,720 --> 03:18:11,160
You kick start the book to kind of like make sure like any any loss the publisher will get

4318
03:18:11,800 --> 03:18:14,040
Is covered for the Kickstarter

4319
03:18:16,520 --> 03:18:18,120
Is that why?

4320
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:23,080
Yeah, that's why they would say yes to it. I thought it was more like if if it's like shown to be

4321
03:18:23,720 --> 03:18:29,160
They like if they like the book if they like the book sure. Yeah, I mean, okay, that's to be popular but

4322
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:36,520
Because I think it's a one specific like series where they where I when I picked it up. I saw that it's like, oh, this was made

4323
03:18:36,760 --> 03:18:38,360
with Kickstarter

4324
03:18:38,360 --> 03:18:43,000
But I remember like reading the pitch for it. So I was like, I assume it's a combination of them liking the book

4325
03:18:43,560 --> 03:18:46,120
But also the Kickstarter like covering for losses

4326
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:51,400
Yeah, like like having some sort of security for the publisher to say yeah, we'll try this

4327
03:18:52,360 --> 03:18:58,280
I mean, I think what the go-to is that like if if it's like popular enough you you can like

4328
03:18:59,160 --> 03:19:02,280
Approach publishers about it. Oh man. I really want to like

4329
03:19:02,920 --> 03:19:06,120
Talk to you talking about a kick you talking about a Kickstarter book

4330
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:10,600
The idea of like using Kickstarter to get a publisher interested in your work

4331
03:19:11,240 --> 03:19:12,520
Yeah

4332
03:19:12,520 --> 03:19:13,800
because um

4333
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:17,160
Yeah, I just mentioned about how like I think they told me that like

4334
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:24,280
Certain Kickstarter's are made to like make sure that any losses the publisher's gonna get is like covered

4335
03:19:24,840 --> 03:19:26,440
by the Kickstarter

4336
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:28,440
Yeah, I mean that like

4337
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:31,160
Isn't wasn't mighty number nine something like that

4338
03:19:31,720 --> 03:19:35,560
Like they didn't like the amount of money that they raised on Kickstarter was like

4339
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:38,920
Definitely not what actually funded the game

4340
03:19:39,720 --> 03:19:43,720
Yeah, it was like it wasn't it that um my number nine was like half of it

4341
03:19:45,800 --> 03:19:46,920
Uh, I can't remember

4342
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:53,400
I I mean, I heard that before I mean, I know that was the case with like Shovel Knight was that like the Kickstarter was gonna pay for half of it

4343
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:56,680
And the other half would be like a publisher

4344
03:19:57,640 --> 03:20:01,000
Or I don't know again, whatever the fuck they're called a video game

4345
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:04,680
I don't know as long as you as long as you um fulfill the

4346
03:20:05,320 --> 03:20:08,040
Promises you make on your Kickstarter. I mean, I don't see any reason why

4347
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:11,240
A publisher can't also

4348
03:20:11,480 --> 03:20:17,400
Yeah, I mean, I mean my goal is that I'm hoping this becomes popular enough that if there's a volume two

4349
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:21,320
We'll have like a publisher who'll cover like half of the cost

4350
03:20:21,960 --> 03:20:23,960
And then the Kickstarter could just focus on

4351
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:30,520
Getting like the artist paid because I do want I I would want the three thousand to be consistent

4352
03:20:31,640 --> 03:20:34,760
Would would it so like it never feel like anyone's getting jibbed

4353
03:20:35,640 --> 03:20:36,920
and like

4354
03:20:36,920 --> 03:20:42,360
Um, if we do get like a publisher like set it up where like artists get like royalties

4355
03:20:42,760 --> 03:20:45,240
Or their story continued to be published, you know

4356
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:48,600
It's a lot. It's a lot of fucking wishful thinking

4357
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:53,160
I wish I had a publisher. Yeah, that's that's it. That's it's tough. Um

4358
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:56,760
The only recent success story that I fucking heard it was um

4359
03:20:57,640 --> 03:20:59,640
What's the name of the guy who created uh

4360
03:21:00,440 --> 03:21:02,440
Mr. Boop

4361
03:21:02,760 --> 03:21:07,960
Oh, Alan Robbins. Yeah, like Robbins. Yeah, because um, he he self published the the first like

4362
03:21:08,600 --> 03:21:14,440
He self published like all the Mr. Boop comics and then he got picked up by a publisher

4363
03:21:15,240 --> 03:21:17,240
But the publisher instead of doing like

4364
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:19,560
um

4365
03:21:19,560 --> 03:21:23,240
Separate books like he did they just published the one collection together

4366
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:28,520
And I seen that like done before like um, there's a comic that I like called copra that like

4367
03:21:29,320 --> 03:21:34,600
Originally they were going to be published through like I because the guy was making the comic for like a years now

4368
03:21:35,640 --> 03:21:39,880
And um, he was just self publishing like he had this whole system on etsy where people would for you

4369
03:21:40,200 --> 03:21:45,320
People would join like the subscription on etsy. So these are the people guaranteed to get copies when they're finished

4370
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:51,000
Um, and he and he did image comics, but then um, he left image comics. Well, he like

4371
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:55,800
He decided he didn't want to do like single issues through image comics because um

4372
03:21:56,760 --> 03:21:58,440
he fucking

4373
03:21:58,440 --> 03:22:03,400
During the pandemic, he fucking saw Todd McFarland like trying to do a Kickstarter for a spawn figure

4374
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:07,800
And it's like what the fuck are you doing, man? I thought you had a whole ass company that handles this

4375
03:22:08,440 --> 03:22:11,960
And you're fucking doing a Kickstarter for a spawn figure. That's that's kind of like

4376
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:14,920
That's kind of like iffy

4377
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,240
so I just looked I just looked up um

4378
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:22,600
I just googled mr. Boop to see if like any like if there was like a Kickstarter for it or anything

4379
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:27,080
And I found an article about it and it includes this photo and caption of ally

4380
03:22:28,200 --> 03:22:31,640
Cartoonist alec robbins eating chipotle. Well dressed in sonic badge

4381
03:22:32,600 --> 03:22:37,080
Photo courtesy of alec robbins. Amazingly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good

4382
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:44,600
Base king move. Uh, yeah, his collection is published by sober sprocket and they're they're the same company who published um

4383
03:22:45,240 --> 03:22:47,240
Pinky and pepper forever

4384
03:22:47,320 --> 03:22:54,040
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, they were they were actually the publisher. I was gonna try to approach the um for the comic that I mean

4385
03:22:54,120 --> 03:22:57,160
Pinky and pepper was made by that girl

4386
03:22:57,800 --> 03:23:00,200
Um, they they transitioned to a man recently

4387
03:23:00,920 --> 03:23:03,800
As of like last year they go by eddie adams now

4388
03:23:04,120 --> 03:23:10,280
Eddie adams. What name did they use to go there? Well, they're dead. Not their dead name is ivy adams

4389
03:23:10,520 --> 03:23:13,400
Oh god, I thought you were gonna say they were dead. I thought you were saying like they died

4390
03:23:13,640 --> 03:23:17,160
No, there's no they they read like a car accident and they got like brain damage or something, right?

4391
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:22,280
They um, yeah, they had an accident because they're on one of those like like scooter things that you could pay for

4392
03:23:23,480 --> 03:23:27,880
And um, they did get yeah, I think they did get some brain damage or something. I mean, I talked to them

4393
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:30,040
I talked to them before and after

4394
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:33,240
Right or no way. I think I only ever talked to them

4395
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:38,600
I can't remember. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait, what you say it again. What was the dead name? Because I I

4396
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:40,440
Ivy adams

4397
03:23:40,440 --> 03:23:44,920
I yes, okay. I remember right eddie. Okay. They go by eddie adams now

4398
03:23:45,880 --> 03:23:51,000
Yeah, okay, but that was the pinkie and pepper first. Yeah, they're the one who did pinkie and pepper

4399
03:23:52,520 --> 03:23:55,800
Which is a good ass book by the way, if people out there haven't read it

4400
03:23:56,680 --> 03:24:00,840
Um, but yeah, I was gonna approach silver sprocket about the whole the new yori

4401
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:03,800
Uh comic, I mean like

4402
03:24:04,120 --> 03:24:09,160
I kind of do want to do a thing like mr. Boop where it's like all online and we could like

4403
03:24:10,520 --> 03:24:13,320
Like I mean read it for free and buy it too

4404
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:19,560
Or maybe do a Kickstarter deal where like we cover half of it and they cover the other half

4405
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:26,760
Um, it's all it's all like so it's also like hard and you don't exactly know what you're gonna get because there's so many like fucking like

4406
03:24:27,800 --> 03:24:29,800
um

4407
03:24:30,280 --> 03:24:31,800
Like I

4408
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:33,240
You guys never heard of uh

4409
03:24:33,240 --> 03:24:35,240
There's like a manga called devils candy

4410
03:24:35,880 --> 03:24:37,880
And it was like it used to be a webcomic. I heard of it

4411
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:42,840
Yeah, and it was a really it's a really good-looking comic like it looks like a manga, right?

4412
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:50,120
And um, they they they were just self publishing their webcomic and I've been so recently they got to deal with like this media and now they have like

4413
03:24:50,920 --> 03:24:53,880
total total bonds of like their their webcomic

4414
03:24:54,920 --> 03:24:55,880
and like

4415
03:24:55,880 --> 03:25:01,240
It's I mean, it's just publishing. It's just a physical copy of the webcomic. You read for free, but you know

4416
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:08,920
Like that's a whole another market you're entering now because like not all people who who read manga

4417
03:25:09,800 --> 03:25:11,800
Are gonna read webcomics, right?

4418
03:25:17,320 --> 03:25:21,960
It's so hard to make ends meet you may as well end it all

4419
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:24,120
Oh

4420
03:25:25,640 --> 03:25:27,640
I can't end it all I have shit to do tomorrow

4421
03:25:28,760 --> 03:25:30,520
Yeah

4422
03:25:30,520 --> 03:25:32,520
You might as well end some of it. No

4423
03:25:33,320 --> 03:25:37,400
Continue everything. Yeah, cut off your leg every year. You then you're not

4424
03:25:38,280 --> 03:25:40,280
Cut off your leg every year and it'll grow back

4425
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:46,920
That's true. That's that's why this is why I make five comics at the same time because it's all

4426
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:50,520
It's all me throwing different things out there. Like let's see what catches on

4427
03:25:51,480 --> 03:25:53,480
Oh, yeah, I'm kind of bad about that

4428
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:57,240
I'm like focused so creatively like like on one thing

4429
03:25:57,240 --> 03:26:03,080
I'm like, ah Clarissa gunsmokes the coolest thing ever very very slowly making progress on it and eventually it'll be a thing

4430
03:26:04,360 --> 03:26:06,920
And then if nobody cares, I'm like, okay

4431
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:19,400
Uh, and I start something you but like I could be like throwing stuff out there. That's like less

4432
03:26:20,760 --> 03:26:23,800
less focused less not like worse but like

4433
03:26:25,640 --> 03:26:28,360
I have so many ideas and I'm like in my head. I'm like, okay

4434
03:26:28,440 --> 03:26:33,800
I'll do them one at a time and I'll build up a huge repertoire of cool comics that I have

4435
03:26:34,600 --> 03:26:37,080
I guess I'm just doing it too slow. I gotta be like

4436
03:26:38,280 --> 03:26:41,480
Throwing them. I gotta be throwing them around. Hey, what?

4437
03:26:42,280 --> 03:26:46,440
You know how I said that my internet's really bad and sometimes it stops working and I can't

4438
03:26:47,400 --> 03:26:48,920
well

4439
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:54,680
Okay, get this it's happening right now. I can't load any websites. It tells me I'm not connected to the internet

4440
03:26:55,240 --> 03:27:01,320
That's because I can hear you. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in the call. I'm in this call on the internet

4441
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:08,360
What that's weird. I can't load Imgir. I can't load Imgir. It thinks I'm no internet try

4442
03:27:09,240 --> 03:27:11,240
What the fuck someone's lying

4443
03:27:12,360 --> 03:27:14,360
Someone's lying

4444
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:17,560
Maybe discord is taking all your bandwidth

4445
03:27:18,520 --> 03:27:20,840
Maybe maybe that would be

4446
03:27:22,040 --> 03:27:24,520
Because this score takes like a lot of space in your computer

4447
03:27:26,200 --> 03:27:28,760
I notice I just don't I just don't understand

4448
03:27:30,120 --> 03:27:34,760
I just I just don't okay. So anyway, I'm doing this kickstarter on the 19th

4449
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:38,680
So watch out watch out gamers

4450
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:41,560
On the night. Yes

4451
03:27:41,560 --> 03:27:45,000
That's uh 13 days after voting day

4452
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:48,680
Here in boston we got a vote for

4453
03:27:50,680 --> 03:27:52,680
governor

4454
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:54,680
I think you got a vote for someone

4455
03:27:55,160 --> 03:27:57,640
now we we voted for governor like uh

4456
03:27:58,920 --> 03:28:00,520
A couple months ago

4457
03:28:00,520 --> 03:28:05,640
We voted for mayor a few months ago now. I've got to do now. We got to do the governor. I think

4458
03:28:10,520 --> 03:28:13,320
So sick, I'm literally sick and tired

4459
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:15,240
Oh boy

4460
03:28:15,240 --> 03:28:19,640
Yeah, being an artist is is hard. I wish there was a way for me to like, I don't know

4461
03:28:20,360 --> 03:28:24,200
Gamble my art using a vile towel currency or something

4462
03:28:25,320 --> 03:28:27,320
If only I could uh

4463
03:28:27,560 --> 03:28:29,080
You should mint

4464
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:30,440
every

4465
03:28:30,440 --> 03:28:38,040
Page of the comic as an nft. You should uh every pixel every individual pixel of every page as an nft

4466
03:28:38,680 --> 03:28:40,680
That's like a billion

4467
03:28:40,680 --> 03:28:46,440
And if you if you increase the this canvas size, you know, like change the dpa. There's more pixels to go around

4468
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:48,440
There's more things to to mint

4469
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:53,800
That's right. Yeah, that's right on tier tier five of clown milk

4470
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,840
You get you get to choose which page you want to mint

4471
03:28:57,480 --> 03:29:03,720
I know how you can hit you can hit $10,000 by selling 100 copies if you include if you also pay extra

4472
03:29:04,040 --> 03:29:05,800
You get an nft

4473
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:06,920
Of the book

4474
03:29:06,920 --> 03:29:12,920
You get the physical book this nft is a receipt for the physical book if the book is destroyed you will retain the nft

4475
03:29:13,400 --> 03:29:14,840
therefore

4476
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:19,320
It's still got you know, it's it's protected forever. You could so read the comp. Well, you can't but you can only

4477
03:29:20,360 --> 03:29:22,360
Yeah, you can't read it. There's the

4478
03:29:22,760 --> 03:29:24,760
It doesn't contain the the book

4479
03:29:24,920 --> 03:29:28,760
But uh, you know, I I I minted my whole family as an nft

4480
03:29:28,840 --> 03:29:34,920
And even though my house burned down and they all died tragically, you know, it's actually fine because I still retain the asset

4481
03:29:35,240 --> 03:29:40,120
They live they live eternally on the blockchain. They live eternally on the block. Exactly

4482
03:29:40,680 --> 03:29:45,800
Exactly selling selling my deceased family members as nfts to pay rent

4483
03:29:47,480 --> 03:29:53,400
Well, you you know, you should have as many children as possible. So if you're low on cash you can mint all of them

4484
03:29:54,280 --> 03:30:01,320
And like as you mint their child, they're like they're turning into pixels like any suck to the computer. They're like, no

4485
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:03,880
No dad, what's going on? I'm scared

4486
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:06,520
father

4487
03:30:06,520 --> 03:30:08,200
father help

4488
03:30:08,200 --> 03:30:09,880
father help

4489
03:30:09,880 --> 03:30:11,880
Be beautiful

4490
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:14,280
Sorry ben jr

4491
03:30:14,280 --> 03:30:20,680
But we we really we really need to cut we really fucking need hbo max and i'm low on cash right now

4492
03:30:21,640 --> 03:30:26,200
I don't put me in the blockchain. No, don't don't put me in the blockchain. Please

4493
03:30:29,240 --> 03:30:33,800
I'm just imagining loads of children in little crates connected by chains

4494
03:30:35,320 --> 03:30:39,880
That are like suspended in some weird home stuck like uh, there's

4495
03:30:40,600 --> 03:30:42,840
Bed thing. You know those chains?

4496
03:30:43,640 --> 03:30:45,640
Oh, yes. Yes

4497
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:47,880
That's what the blockchain is

4498
03:30:48,840 --> 03:30:56,440
I'm picturing it like um, you know at the end of scott pilgrim when uh, gideon has all the the the women in like those pods

4499
03:30:56,840 --> 03:30:57,880
Yeah

4500
03:30:57,880 --> 03:31:01,160
It's like that. I don't know it's frozen in stasis

4501
03:31:02,120 --> 03:31:03,240
Interesting

4502
03:31:03,240 --> 03:31:05,240
I guess there's no there's no chain there

4503
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:08,600
No, the durst chain is better better. Yeah

4504
03:31:10,360 --> 03:31:15,160
Uh, what do we think I think we think we want to maybe call it here. We've been going for a long time

4505
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:17,800
I think I think we're good right here

4506
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:19,160
Yeah

4507
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:23,560
Uh, we had no and you know what no voicemail. We're free of the curse of voicemail

4508
03:31:24,040 --> 03:31:27,560
Yeah, dead. We've already answered the questions. We can just stop

4509
03:31:28,360 --> 03:31:30,520
You can stop anytime we want. Um

4510
03:31:31,080 --> 03:31:34,600
Now you gotta bring you gotta bring back topics to replace voicemail

4511
03:31:35,400 --> 03:31:37,640
Like after the voicemails we start a topic

4512
03:31:41,240 --> 03:31:43,240
We kind of did that

4513
03:31:43,320 --> 03:31:45,320
Today's topic is um

4514
03:31:45,720 --> 03:31:50,120
Eight hour videos eight hour videos eight hour videos like them hate them

4515
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:56,760
Only when they're eight hours eight minutes and 88 seconds. Wait, you can't have 88. Yeah. Oh, you know what?

4516
03:31:57,320 --> 03:32:01,160
Sucks so they're bad. Okay. They're all they're all bad. It's gotta be um

4517
03:32:02,360 --> 03:32:04,360
five hour videos

4518
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:05,800
That are

4519
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:12,120
Exactly that are like you can play a little number games 55 minutes and 55 seconds. Yeah

4520
03:32:13,400 --> 03:32:15,720
Ruining the bit by making it eight hours

4521
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:18,440
Well, no by making it nine hours

4522
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:20,040
uh

4523
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:22,040
28 minutes

4524
03:32:22,520 --> 03:32:24,520
and then plus

4525
03:32:24,520 --> 03:32:25,720
I can't do the math

4526
03:32:25,720 --> 03:32:28,200
29 minutes and uh

4527
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:34,840
And in 28 seconds, which would be equivalent to eight hours 88 minutes and 88 seconds. I think

4528
03:32:35,480 --> 03:32:38,440
So, uh, yeah, look forward to make any sense

4529
03:32:39,400 --> 03:32:45,000
Look forward to my five hour response. So you need to name a source is the independent of nft video

4530
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:49,240
You should do you should make a response. You should make an eight second response

4531
03:32:49,880 --> 03:32:51,240
Yeah

4532
03:32:51,240 --> 03:32:56,760
You should go through it. No, you should go through it frame by frame and do like a like a e uh e-fap

4533
03:32:57,320 --> 03:32:59,560
E like an e-fap Jenny Nicholson like

4534
03:33:00,200 --> 03:33:03,560
29 hour response to the eight hour to the eight hour video

4535
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:05,160
uh

4536
03:33:05,160 --> 03:33:06,600
easy

4537
03:33:07,080 --> 03:33:12,520
All right. Yeah, let's uh, let's call it. I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm gonna go lie down any final

03:33:13,960 --> 03:33:16,520
Final plug. Do your plug if you got this plug

4539
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:22,520
Look up. Uh, you need to look up my nsfw account, which is creamy pot pasta tc

Don't come mentate that ben cast ben no one will watch it, but she was wrong and the fans when i come the patreon is exploding

4560
03:34:24,680 --> 03:34:26,680
Um

4561
03:34:26,840 --> 03:34:31,880
Okay, and maybe we'll fix the voicemail soon. Uh, maybe not depends how I feel

4562
03:34:32,120 --> 03:34:37,000
If you give you donate more to the to the patreon you um the voicemails are most likely to get fixed

4563
03:34:37,720 --> 03:34:43,240
If you donate a lot if you pay me a thousand dollars, I will never fix the voicemail and it will stay dead forever
