1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Okay, I'm doing me record.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
Boom!

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
Done.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,520
Did I record?

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,200
I can't believe it's not recording.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,880
I want a cereal box of Ben that's, oops, all capitalism.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Oops.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,880
That's pretty good.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,960
You should have saved that for the episode.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Damn it.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
You're right.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
You know what?

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm recording.

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
You know what?

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Yeah, fuck it.

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
It's all in there.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Put it in.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Put it in there.

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Don't miss a second of this gold.

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,720
Just get a cereal box, you know, with the Kickstarter and whatnot, getting these donations, getting

21
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
the DCC places.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Right.

23
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
We should sync quick and then begin.

24
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
On the count of three, say sync.

25
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,880
One, two, three.

26
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Sync.

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
All right.

28
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
That's good enough.

29
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Welcome, everybody, to the Pro Crastinators Podcast.

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,400
The Pro Capitalism Podcast, rather, and we're here to just have a great time with

31
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
everyone.

32
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm waiting.

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,680
I couldn't beat other decisions for the name change.

34
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
That is too bad.

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
That is too bad.

36
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
These things happen.

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
I'm the best guy ever.

38
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
We got Ben Saints.

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
We got Munchy.

40
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
We got Tom.

41
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
You know them.

42
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
There they are.

43
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
No, we don't.

44
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
We don't have Munchy at all, actually.

45
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Well, luckily, they have glowing icons down below.

46
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,240
I am signed in on Munchy's account because I am here at Slime, wait, RFCKcon, RFCKcon

47
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,160
6, aka Bronycon 2.

48
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,520
But we've been to many Bronycons.

49
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,160
That's not Bronycon 2.

50
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Yeah.

51
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,080
Even Munchy had been to many Bronycons.

52
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,560
For who is it Bronycon 2?

53
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Is it just the RFCK?

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,480
Well, for all the RFCK boys, that Bronycon was the last Bronycon was the only Bronycon.

55
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,120
They've all been calling this Bronycon 2, which I just...

56
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
They're not even...

57
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Me too, I guess.

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Me too, I guess.

59
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Yeah.

60
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, yeah.

61
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,520
It's a meme, as the kids say.

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
But they'll give.

63
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Maybe you've heard of it.

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
I mean, most of these guys were the guys who were at Bronycon, and they met each other

65
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,720
for the first time there.

66
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,200
So to them, this is basically the second big slime meetup.

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
You know, speaking of like this conversation...

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,880
And by the way, we have slime.

69
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
We literally have...

70
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
You have incredible.

71
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,640
There's like lots of slime around.

72
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
It's so fucking great.

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
We're sloshing.

74
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,480
This particular point about being...

75
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,920
We're the old fucks doing...

76
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,560
We've been to Bronycon many times, done lots of meetups, radcons, et cetera, et cetera.

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
It reminds me that in Yes, in the thing I did with Digi and the other anime guys, Jack

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,600
is Boy in Core, as well as Man Mode, our seasonal wrap-up, it's at the point now where Jack

79
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,240
is Boy is 18.

80
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,400
The other guys were 20, 25, something like that.

81
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
I am 29.

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,440
I am the oldest person in the group talking about children's cartoons.

83
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,240
It's like shit, doesn't it?

84
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,600
It's beginning to be deeply unsettling.

85
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
There's no way around it.

86
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
At this age, you should be creating children's cartoons.

87
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Unironically true.

88
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
If I don't own the means of production by now, I'm beginning to doubt I ever will.

89
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,360
And that's the most concerning thought.

90
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Hell yeah.

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,520
You gotta find some up-and-coming mangaka and be their producer and take all their cash.

92
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
That's the way.

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,080
Street smarts and my moral ambiguity to do what's necessary.

94
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Finance my anime, Nate, please.

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Together we'll take over the world.

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
That makes sense.

97
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
That makes sense.

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, let's talk quickly about a little thing that I'm sure we're all excited about.

99
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,160
Radcon 4 Kickstarter, as of the time of you hearing this, right now launched it.

100
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
It wasn't done.

101
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Let me look at that.

102
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
It wasn't done before.

103
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Yeah, it's doing real well.

104
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Have you not seen the recent event?

105
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
I have.

106
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Take a little look.

107
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
I have seen it.

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh!

109
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Take a look.

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,200
Okay, well, listen, here's what I already knew.

111
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Like, you know, I kind of feel like I should tell the entire story of my weekend, like,

112
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,520
sort of in relation to it, but like, I don't want to drag the conversation to the side.

113
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Okay, well, tell you what, let's just get the important detail is guys, Radcon 4 Paradise

114
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,400
Kickstarter is launched.

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,600
There are incredible goodies you can get by signing up for it.

116
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,280
And the project, look, I'm not going to pretend that we're in dire straits right now.

117
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,680
We are currently almost just 24 hours, like 28 hours after launching, we're at over $7,000

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,000
and that's 87% funded with over 100, 101 backers, and we've got like 30 days to go.

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
So I'm feeling pretty good.

120
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Yeah.

121
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,040
We have two $1,000 pledgers who decided who who decided that the campaign should end

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
on a fucking Tuesday.

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
I just gave it 31 days, dog.

124
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
It's a month.

125
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I don't know.

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Doopsy, doopsy, I guess.

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Listen, now the Kickstarter is going to fail and it's all your fault, so.

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,160
Listen, guys, I just want to remind everybody, look, we, by the time you hear this, I would

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,560
love it if we hit our stretch goals, keep going.

130
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,680
There are so many rewards and we have stretch goals waiting if we reach the ones we've already

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
got.

132
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,480
So I have no fear.

133
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,960
So go give money now at Radcon 4 Paradise.

134
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,200
Click the top link in the description.

135
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,520
No doubt.

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Support the thing.

137
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400
It's going to be on happening in like a month and a half.

138
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Here you go.

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Pretty incredible.

140
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,360
I was pretty confident it was going to hit its goals.

141
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't think it was going to hit them in like three days.

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That looks good.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's looking good.

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's looking good.

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was very nice to see.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,120
I was a little worried before we launched it.

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
We were all worried.

148
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,320
This is all going to go to shit.

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Oh no.

150
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Oh no.

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
What if it makes more money than Vapors 2?

152
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,320
God, I hope it does.

153
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
God, terrible.

154
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,200
And I'll just say that I was worried for...

155
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
The situation really has changed.

156
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I get all nervous.

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm like, oh God, I know now that we need to make more money than we asked for last

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,640
time in order to actually break even.

159
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I hope we get there.

160
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,120
It's looking good right now.

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,640
But the situation really, people are thirsty.

162
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,040
It's been two years since Radcon 3.

163
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,440
Like Radcon 3 we went into with kind of a cloud of like, ooh, should we even be doing

164
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
a Kickstarter?

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,760
Like did you hadn't finished this thing?

166
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,440
Sure, this is our first one.

167
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
All that's gone.

168
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
Radcon 3 was such a success.

169
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,520
There was nothing bad about it.

170
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
It just took a little while to get done.

171
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,360
But we delivered on every fucking thing.

172
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,320
So as far as I can tell, people are pretty, people are rewarding us so far for our good

173
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
behavior.

174
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, the good boy points.

175
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
I'm finally catching man.

176
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
You're catching.

177
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
You got to feel this man.

178
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,600
So I didn't know that this RFC KCON was happening.

179
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
Well I knew it was happening this weekend.

180
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,840
I thought it was starting Friday.

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,800
But on Thursday I get people like, wait no.

182
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,480
I have to like, I have to back up because I went on a date on Thursday, on Wednesday

183
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,000
and I got super hammered and I was completely hungover and obliterated and I lost my phone

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,200
and I lost my wallet.

185
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
I lost everything.

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,960
My life is in shambles, right?

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
So everything.

188
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Did you find them again by chance?

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
No.

190
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
No, it's all gone.

191
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Oh, Jesus.

192
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
It's all gone.

193
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Did you take them, do you think?

194
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I don't think so.

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
But I mean.

196
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
That would be really funny.

197
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
But okay.

198
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I guess you never know.

199
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
All right.

200
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,360
So yeah, that happened on Wednesday and I go out on this date and I lose everything

201
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
and my life is ruined.

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
And then.

203
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
It's too bad.

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I go.

205
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,840
So then Thursday I'm obliterated and people are banging on my door and I'm like, what

206
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
the fuck?

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Leave me alone.

208
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't ever want to wake up again.

209
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,920
And it's fucking munchy and caszy at my house.

210
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,160
Like Ben, we got to go slime house right now.

211
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Like people are getting here.

212
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Like they're already here.

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
We got to go meet them.

214
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Oh.

215
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Oh, please.

216
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
No.

217
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Typical Ben.

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,520
And then like only like, and then I completely forget that Radcon 4 is the thing that's happening.

219
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
And then the next.

220
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Jesus Christ.

221
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
We do all this.

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
We do slime.

223
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
You know, you do slime things.

224
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,960
You know, you do all the obvious stuff that you do with slime, right?

225
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Of course.

226
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,920
Like I don't even need to like insult you by insinuating that you wouldn't know what to

227
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
do with slime if you had some.

228
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I appreciate that.

229
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
But you do that.

230
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,360
And then the next day munch is like, oh, hey, Ben, remember the Radcon 4 Kickstarter?

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,560
And I'm like, oh, God, that launched.

232
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Oh, fuck.

233
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Oh, fuck.

234
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
He's like, oh, yeah.

235
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
It's like $4,000 and like six hours.

236
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm like, okay.

237
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Good.

238
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Nice.

239
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
True.

240
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
And then yeah.

241
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
And then this morning I asked him like what it was at and he said like 5,000 and I was

242
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
like, oh, okay.

243
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Pretty good.

244
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Slowing down.

245
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
But that's fine.

246
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
And then like I checked now and it's like 7, 7, 200.

247
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Lamal.

248
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Yep.

249
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm, I'm depressed because I mean, I'm sad that I lost my wallet and my, and my phone.

250
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Like that, like imagine, imagine you, imagine if that happened to you, dear viewer.

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,480
Would you be this common collected about it?

252
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Absolutely not.

253
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
You would be, you would be ravaged.

254
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,800
You would be, you would be in, in disarray, um, devastated.

255
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,720
But like I'm almost as sad because the bartender hates me and I feel bad.

256
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Oh no.

257
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,320
I went back to the, I went back to the bar that I was at where I know for a fact I must

258
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,600
have lost it because I had it when I walked in and I didn't have it when I walked out.

259
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,280
So it disappeared there 100%.

260
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,760
And I go inside and I'm like, hey, hey, um, did you guys find like a wallet or a phone

261
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
around here?

262
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
And the bartender like glares at me.

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,880
He like sets his jaw and he glares at me and he's like, no, no, we didn't.

264
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,120
And I'm like, oh, okay, hey, do you, do you recognize me?

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,400
He's like, yeah, you were asking about it all last night.

266
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
We don't have it.

267
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
We still don't have it.

268
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,120
And I'm like, oh God, like I'm so sorry.

269
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I'm so sorry.

270
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
You hate me so much.

271
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Like what did I do?

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I mean, I didn't say this.

273
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
But like, I walk out.

274
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It must have been very obnoxious.

275
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
I guess.

276
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
I guess I must have been obnoxious.

277
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,400
But like I walk out and I'm like, oh God, I must, for someone to hate me that much,

278
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
I must be the worst.

279
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
No doubt.

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
No doubt.

281
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
So wait, you don't remember it?

282
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,480
You came, like were you drunk when you came there and asked over and over again?

283
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
Well, I was, it was the second bar I'd been to.

284
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
I was a little drunk when I went in.

285
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,480
I was pretty fucking obliterated when I left.

286
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,120
You're really creating a rogues gallery of people you've had negative experiences with

287
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
while drunk.

288
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
There's them.

289
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
There's your neighbors.

290
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
They're all going to form up.

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
The neighbors are fine.

292
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
We patch things up with the neighbors.

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Those guys are cool.

294
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Okay.

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,280
Or so it would appear.

296
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,360
So it would seem.

297
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,480
So wait, sorry, what was the question?

298
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,640
No question.

299
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Please move on.

300
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Fine.

301
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,200
Anyway, but I'm saying like this interaction with this one bartender, like seemingly like

302
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,080
being like peeved at me, like like set the entire tone from a lesser man would have let

303
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
it ruin their weekend, but not me.

304
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,440
I've sold it on fortitude, the game, moral fiber.

305
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,920
So did that have a negative impact on RFC K stuff?

306
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,960
I mean, you weren't able to play, I guess fucking slime tag or whatever, you know, your

307
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
phone and shit.

308
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,280
Well, I mean, I was a kingpin anyway, so I wasn't like competing, but yeah, we did.

309
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Okay.

310
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,720
Let me, let me give you some highlights of RFC Kcon.

311
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,440
We did the IRL gang violence, a game which I invented, by the way.

312
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,760
It's the one, basically you use your phone as a gun and the goal is that rowdies and

313
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,960
killers like spread out over an area and you have to shoot each other by taking a picture

314
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
of each other.

315
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,320
Did people correctly wear colors and posting it in the proper discord channel?

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Were they pink and purple decked out?

317
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,600
Yes, you have to wear, you have to wear your team color.

318
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
You know, during that game, a frame sent me a picture of Kazian said, I got her for

319
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
Yenet and I appreciate that.

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:33,040
There was one of her in mid, she looks like really weird and off balance and tilted because

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,440
she's like in the minute of turning around to run away.

322
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,360
It's kind of like that one of you in mid run.

323
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
The one of me.

324
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
The legendary.

325
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Yeah, bolting.

326
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Yeah.

327
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,720
In fact, I think I have it right here as a matter of fact, here, take a look.

328
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Is this the one?

329
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
I had a leaning, oh wait, the wrong, wrong chat here.

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There we go.

331
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, that's dynamic.

332
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
I mean, this is the killing shot.

333
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
This was the killing shot.

334
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
Yeah, they both have their fucking guns out.

335
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Wait, post the one of you, post the one of you sprinting.

336
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay, we'll have to find that one.

337
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I don't have it on hand, but we can take, we'll put it both for consideration.

338
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,720
It must be in the meetup server.

339
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
No doubt.

340
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
All right.

341
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,480
So we did that and then yesterday we went out to the Boston Common.

342
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,640
We made signs, we made protest signs.

343
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,520
We went out and we marched around the Boston Common and we raised slime awareness.

344
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Right.

345
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,280
We all went out in like a big group with like signs and we just said like, slime war now.

346
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Slime war now.

347
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
GMO.

348
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Get GMO.

349
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
So we can link that.

350
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,160
Wait, how did you know about GMOs?

351
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
Cause there's a live stream of it.

352
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,520
I think Kof was holding the camera or something.

353
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,640
Look right here, somebody was holding the camera, this slime awareness protest.

354
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,800
Fuck, I didn't know anyone streamed it, lol.

355
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Okay.

356
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
It was really funny.

357
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,000
It was really, it was really cold out, but it was actually pretty fun and like it didn't

358
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,600
even get boring because we just kept, we just like kept walking the whole time.

359
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,520
We walked by like the skating rink and like every, like people on this, like, like there

360
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,520
were tons of people on the skating rink and like a whole bunch of them like turned to

361
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,600
like look and be like, what the fuck are these guys doing?

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Nice.

363
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,120
There was, okay, we like stopped on sort of like a footpath that's sort of like a fork

364
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,360
in the footpath and we just stand there and we all start singing the new Los Angeles city

365
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,320
and like we're chanting and we start singing the anthem and literally like the fucking

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
cops like roll up like and they just like stop in front of us and are just like looking

367
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
at us for a while.

368
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,600
And we just keep chanting and like they just wait there for a minute and then they just

369
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
like keep going.

370
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,200
It's just waiting to see if you're saying the end word.

371
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,640
We stared him down.

372
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
We stared him down.

373
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,960
So that urge to kill was rising, but well done fighting it down.

374
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
It was pretty cool.

375
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,200
Like nobody, like nobody like gave us any trouble about it.

376
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,880
Like people just like seemed either like confused or like curious or amused.

377
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
It was really fun.

378
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Appropriate.

379
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,280
And then last night we did the, I feel like, I feel like Radcon 4 has already started for

380
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,000
me because me and Munchy we did the long awaited RFCKCon lecture.

381
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,640
So we basically have another, what I guess you could broadly categorize as a PCP lecture

382
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,080
coming out, probably before Radcon even happens, Ethan's going to edit it.

383
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,360
So I don't know exactly how long it will be, but it's Ethan's track record for speed

384
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,000
of editing is a bit dubious.

385
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I would say.

386
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's true.

387
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where's stealing your dad's?

388
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Where's stealing your dad's?

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Where's stealing your dad's?

390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, actually he finished a few of them.

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Wasn't what you're saying that like they're done?

392
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
He just hasn't.

393
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Not all of them.

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,480
Why would you ever not release a video that's done?

395
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,120
I don't understand them.

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I don't know.

397
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,760
If frame, if frame was asking Munchy where's stealing your dad's and Munchy said like,

398
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
no, it's not my fault.

399
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
It's Ethan's fault.

400
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,040
And Ethan dodged and weaved and dove out of the line of sight of the question so he couldn't

401
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,280
be asked it.

402
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,520
Dove like he tried to dodge from my killing blow at last slide fast, where I fucking

403
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
executed him.

404
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
It was glorious.

405
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Yeah.

406
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Yeah.

407
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Feel the shame.

408
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Feel the shame.

409
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
The killers obliterated in real life gang violence.

410
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Yes.

411
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Finally.

412
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
They won something.

413
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,800
They started, the Rowdies had like 11 people to the killers six and like in the end, like

414
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,840
four of the killers were still alive.

415
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Yeah.

416
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,960
Like the killers just, the killers like routed them.

417
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
It was pretty incredible.

418
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Incredible.

419
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Way to go guys.

420
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
And last, there's some victory.

421
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,080
RCKCon's been wicked fun.

422
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,640
It's sad that like people, oh, it's sad people are trickling out.

423
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
A weird thing happened.

424
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,280
And this is interesting just as a thing I did not know could happen with an Airbnb.

425
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,840
But like, okay, so we get to the house and it's this like quaint little like grandma

426
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
house, right?

427
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,080
Like this, this older woman, this older woman like owns it and we get here and she's like,

428
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,240
I think she's like a little confused like why like 10 guys are just like gonna be just

429
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
like partying here.

430
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,200
But like, she doesn't, she's not gonna, she doesn't care.

431
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
Like she's, she's, she's cool with it.

432
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,640
She seems, she's pretty nice.

433
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,960
She's a total juvie core though, but, but she, so she seems nice enough.

434
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,160
And then she calls us, we have the house rented for two days and she calls Monday and she's

435
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,840
like, Hey guys, um, I'll just let you stay another day if you just like shovel the driveway

436
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
for me.

437
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Dang.

438
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,120
And we're like, yeah, like, I mean, most people already had their flights booked so they couldn't

439
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
stay.

440
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Right, right.

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
But a few of us were like, yeah, why not?

442
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll stay another day.

443
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Yeah.

444
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Cause like, cause it snowed.

445
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Sure.

446
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,720
Cause it snowed and you are like, you are legally obligated to keep your sidewalks clean.

447
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,300
So she would have had to like come up herself and clear the driveway or something.

448
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,080
So she was just like, I don't want to do that.

449
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,480
I'll just let them do it and they can stay another day.

450
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
And she's like, yeah.

451
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,120
And like, don't worry about being out by noon.

452
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
You can just be out anytime.

453
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I don't care.

454
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Damn, that's great.

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Yeah.

456
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
It was like, she's just like, just like stay in my house.

457
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
I don't give a shit.

458
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,680
I mean, if it's there and she like doesn't have another Airbnb lined up, it's no skin

459
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
up her back.

460
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,760
No, like, yeah, it costs her nothing.

461
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
She's like, I might as well let them stay.

462
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Why not?

463
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
So is today the extra day?

464
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Now we don't have tomorrow.

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
The extra day.

466
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Today, today, we were supposed to be leaving noon today.

467
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,960
Now we're leaving noon tomorrow now.

468
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
That's cool.

469
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Nice.

470
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
So that's great.

471
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,760
So we are now into the extra day.

472
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,080
See, what are you going to do?

473
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Do you have any plans?

474
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,680
No, I have no idea what the plans were.

475
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,720
I had every intention of showing up and then I didn't know.

476
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
I didn't know.

477
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Oh yeah, you could still come.

478
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I know.

479
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,520
I could, I could like head in after this, I guess, question mark.

480
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Wait, yes.

481
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Do it.

482
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Tom, you absolutely should.

483
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
Wait, didn't, didn't people message you?

484
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Cassie messaged me.

485
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,560
I found out that it was going on when I saw the first live stream upload on YouTube like

486
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
halfway through yesterday.

487
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm like, oh, I guess I missed that.

488
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Wait, what?

489
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,560
I told, okay, I told like Cassie and Munchie like, hey, message, message crack, message

490
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Tom.

491
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,520
We, like we literally talked about like, hey, is Tom going to show up?

492
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,000
Everyone dropped the ball because no one messaged me at all.

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,800
This is what happens when you don't have a Nate in your organization.

494
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,200
All these things fall through the cracks.

495
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,160
You got to hire someone to be your Nate guy.

496
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
That's so fucking stupid.

497
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yeah, it is.

498
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
I was doing nothing for the last two days, I could have been there.

499
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
That's so...

500
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Ugh.

501
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I mean, you know what?

502
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,440
To be fair, Tom, why didn't you message, you know, anybody who could maybe give you

503
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
answers here?

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,320
Well, I mean, if you didn't know, it was already happening.

505
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
I didn't know it was happening.

506
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Okay.

507
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I guess that's true.

508
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
I guess that's true.

509
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,840
Why would I message Ben and be like, hey, Ben, this thing that I don't know is going

510
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
on?

511
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Is it going on?

512
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Okay, fair point.

513
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,640
To be fair though, we couldn't let you like stay over anything because like we are, we

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,320
are like overbooked on like beds, like people like, like every, like every bed is like taken

515
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,320
and like, and people that don't even like, didn't even pay to stay here, keep like, like

516
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,520
getting wasted and like passing out on our beds and it's not cool, damn it.

517
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Yeah.

518
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Yeah.

519
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,640
But I guess, I guess that's my fucking RFCK story so far.

520
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Really excited for them.

521
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
The journey continues.

522
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
The madness ensues.

523
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Yeah.

524
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Continuously.

525
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,520
Who was, I know Johnny Miller Chip was like you to, to go in over there and then everyone.

526
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Johnny Miller Chip, he was cool.

527
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Johnny Miller Chip.

528
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Oh God, I'm going to feel bad.

529
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm going to forget people.

530
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:15,880
Johnny Miller Chip, Ephraim, Koff, Ethan, Connor, Levy Jevy, Bevan, Nobby, Spidey Juice,

531
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Pizza Chan.

532
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.

533
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Yeah.

534
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I know.

535
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
The whole cat.

536
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
What about Paradox Crotch?

537
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,400
Oh, Chad was here.

538
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Chad from BronyCon.

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, yes.

540
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, Chad.

541
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
Oh, fantastic.

542
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Yeah.

543
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Fantastic.

544
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
He didn't have the hair though.

545
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
That's okay.

546
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I forgive him.

547
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Uh, Azcan, who is like only like, not, not, he's like a pseudo slime.

548
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
GCF.

549
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
He's more of a GCF.

550
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Slime adjacent.

551
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Yeah.

552
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,160
God, I, I know I'm forgetting a couple and I'm going to feel so bad.

553
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
I, I didn't mean for you to like list everyone.

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I was just wondering.

555
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Yeah.

556
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm really bored right now actually.

557
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
It sucks.

558
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Sorry.

559
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Let's move on.

560
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Excuse me.

561
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
You know, Dive.

562
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Let's throw out of the reward.

563
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,320
Hey, how come Crocs never comes to these things?

564
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Is he like far away or something?

565
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,600
I mean, everybody comes from far away, but like, yeah.

566
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I guess you're right.

567
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,800
Well, if Crocs did come to, um, number two, I think Crocs came to RFCKcon two.

568
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Okay, fair enough.

569
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Fair enough.

570
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah.

571
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Um, well, there you go, everybody.

572
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,440
Keep your eyes peeled for RFCKcon seven and maybe you too can join these boys.

573
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,520
We got, we wanted, we wanted, we wanted to do the next one in like the summer or the

574
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,040
spring because like it's really fucking cold out these last couple days.

575
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
It sucks.

576
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,080
All right, let's move on with our lives.

577
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Yeah.

578
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,000
So, so I will a little bit, uh, like Radcon for the, I was, it sort of fucked up my, my

579
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,760
weekend, um, just because of the, the stress and the fact that, um, at like the 11th, the

580
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,480
11th hour, it was like, we wanted to get this thing done as soon as possible because there

581
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,720
was a possibility that, um, the Kickstarter could take days to get approved before we

582
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
could launch it.

583
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,720
So we wanted to get like the, the, the trailer done and the art done and everything and the,

584
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,160
you know, all the texts correct.

585
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,240
But it was basically just me and Nate because RFCKcon had started and, uh, Tom wasn't around

586
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
for some of it.

587
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,080
And it was like, uh, I was trying to also get time for doing the Lord of Ghosts comic.

588
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,520
And I think all of that sort of like, like, uh, bubbled over into like, uh, I'm, I quote,

589
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,640
unquote, burnt out lol stupid and, um, I, I prioritize Radcon for, and that's all good.

590
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,920
And that's the Kickstarter, the Kickstarter going well really quickly was very relieving

591
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,560
for me, but I sort of fallen off, off the wagon a little on drawing, uh, which, you

592
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,840
know, I'll get back to it on Monday, but I've, I've, I've seen a new anime guys.

593
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,680
It's, it's, it's, it's that one that, the one with the glasses.

594
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Favorite or whatever.

595
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Yeah.

596
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Yeah.

597
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah.

598
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,920
I watched a couple episodes back in the day, didn't get it, but that was like five years

599
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,760
ago and I just haven't bothered to check.

600
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,320
Well, um, is it that old?

601
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
I have, you know, it probably more like three years, maybe three or four.

602
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I have never seen this before.

603
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Maybe two.

604
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I have not either.

605
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
San, San Getsuno Lion.

606
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Um, it's Digi's number one of the last decade.

607
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
So yeah.

608
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
That's bullshit.

609
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,760
So it's kind of a recent discovery for him.

610
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,960
This art, this art style looks familiar though.

611
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,240
I feel like I've seen other things by the same artist.

612
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes.

613
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,440
I forget who did it, but yeah.

614
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,640
The funny like lips are funny, but the, um, the thing I really like in episode seven

615
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:40,240
is, well, it's, it's an anime about a sort of depressed learner, loser, boy, uh, Shogi

616
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,880
professional guy.

617
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,080
Um, he's good at Shogi and he does that and he doesn't know how to talk to people or make

618
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,480
friends and because of tragic things and just general social awkwardness and it's kind

619
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,360
of sad, but then, you know, he has all these wiki friends and sort of cheer him up and

620
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,160
it's cool and cute and nice, uh, very emotional, very well, uh, very artistic and all that.

621
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,440
But in episode seven, there's this conversation he has with this, um, this, uh, sports boy,

622
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,320
this, uh, baseball man.

623
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,640
Um, and, uh, you know, he's really nervous because this guy's younger than him and much

624
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,080
taller and stronger and, uh, he's like, you know, being a socially awkward Nimwit, Nimrod.

625
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,760
Um, and he doesn't know what to say and this guy's asking him a question about, you know,

626
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,860
you know, being professional because this guy is a pro, pro, uh, Shogi player despite

627
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:36,000
being still in school and it's like he, this baseball boy looks up to him in that way and

628
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,760
he's like, he sees the determination in this baseball guy's eyes and he's like, I can't

629
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
lie to this guy.

630
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,960
I can't do what I do in every other conversation and just give him some flip and answer that

631
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,200
wouldn't be right.

632
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,320
So he opens up, he does, he does, he bears his soul.

633
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,800
He says something that's really true to himself and kind of embarrassing to admit.

634
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,780
And in this conversation, the guy resonates with it and he understands and he gets it.

635
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,640
And then Shogi boy is like, what is this feeling?

636
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,000
I feel happy.

637
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,800
I've connected with a human being and there's less, like, this is almost romantic, sort

638
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,680
of like, I can't believe you can talk to people and have them understand you.

639
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,520
And that's like so fucking valuable and I love it.

640
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,840
And it's like, that was the coolest moment.

641
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,040
It was a really cool moment because that's like, ah, I know that feel.

642
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,560
Sometimes that happens to me.

643
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,400
Sometimes I'm, I can't resonate or talk to anyone and like have them understand what

644
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm feeling.

645
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,360
But when it works, it's so fucking real.

646
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,040
Well, you know what that reminds me of a little bit?

647
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,720
It's that like, even us in our group here, when we like talk about stuff and like meetings

648
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,760
or just whatever online, it's like generally via text, you know, sometimes we're on calls.

649
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,440
Mostly it's like through text and like, that's fine and all, but just like when we're actually

650
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,320
in person at something like, oh, I don't know, a rad con, it like, you know, cause like,

651
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,160
what do they say, like 90% of communication is nonverbal.

652
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,520
It's like, it's like, oh, this is kind of like how humans are like supposed to interact

653
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,400
and like, ah, it's just like way better and doesn't suck in every way.

654
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
We were talking about that and like people, there are people that like use, they used

655
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
to have like beef and stuff.

656
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,000
There's people who like use like not like each other, but then like as soon as they met

657
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,560
each other in person, like that all like didn't matter.

658
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
You forget what it is.

659
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Wow.

660
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,800
That's like who gives a shit about that.

661
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,440
It always happens pretty much always.

662
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Yep.

663
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,120
It's, it's, I'm so, I'm so excited for rad con for, I'm so excited to be there and just

664
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,320
to hang out and play video games and be silly and watch lectures and just have fun moments.

665
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,680
I can't wait to like go and get breakfast or whatever we do, like we eat food or whatever

666
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
we do.

667
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Yeah.

668
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah.

669
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,560
I just think about that all the time of how like, oh, people like have friends and like

670
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,120
hang out on the regular and it's not something that happens like once every year, how strange.

671
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
What a concept.

672
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,680
I mean, that's the right way to live, but it totally is.

673
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,240
It's the, that's the sort of thing of those like it's so, that scene in that, in the enemy,

674
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:11,520
in the enemy was so powerful because this guy doesn't really connect with people generally.

675
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,960
Like it need to be a very specific kind of brain person to, you know, to click with him.

676
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,600
I mean, he can, he can socially under, you know, he's fine in social situations.

677
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840
But like this was such a big moment for him because it's like a person that he's talking

678
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,880
to who really gets him on one strange little way that like he's never really admitted before.

679
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,360
And it's, it's one of those like, you don't want to admit that like, you don't click with

680
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,280
everyone you meet, even if you like them.

681
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,120
Like there's some, there's a certain like some, like with my brothers, like I know them

682
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,760
so well, we're so like close that it feels so different from meeting like a very close

683
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
acquaintance.

684
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,720
I mean, you guys are like high up there in terms of like people who I resonate with much

685
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,640
more than people I've met through school because you only see them, you know, you, you are

686
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,680
in proximity to them, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you, you know, feel the same way.

687
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Like, I don't know.

688
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,800
Michelle tells me just for example, because I work at home, I don't, I honestly don't

689
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,200
interact with a lot of people day to day, except through internet, but like she'll have

690
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,840
like coworkers at various places and like it's just, they just, they don't connect,

691
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,360
you know, like they're, what are they going to talk about?

692
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,680
Like you can be nice, you can say things, how relatable, you talk about the movies,

693
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,680
you can talk about this or that and it's like, all right, did you hear about new product?

694
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Fantastic.

695
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,880
One of these days, one of these days, it's going to be like, you know how like people

696
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,320
watch, I think you've said this, Nate, like, like people watch sports, like not because

697
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,080
they really care about sports, which is because it's like something to talk about.

698
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,680
So you like have like, you have context into no doubt, like what people are saying.

699
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,560
Well, eventually you get to the point that you just got to have kids, not because you

700
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,760
actually want to, just because otherwise what the fuck else are you going to talk about?

701
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,320
You have to relate about something.

702
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,080
That's why the internet is too powerful.

703
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,600
It's making people like find people that they actually connect with, like just, they're

704
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
just really far away from each other and then they don't, they don't need to watch sports

705
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,680
or have kids.

706
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
They don't need to do these things.

707
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,040
As a result, they don't invest in their local environment, perhaps they're not like focused

708
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,080
on, they don't develop the skills that people used to have to of like, oh, I should be able

709
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,120
when I'm out just to be able to like make friends and talk to people in a casual way.

710
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
You got to have a some balance of both.

711
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I would think that.

712
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Yeah, you definitely do.

713
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,960
But it's, it's, it's so much more like succulent and delicious to have a really cool internet

714
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,480
friend and then meet them in real life, then to practice talking to people you don't really

715
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,880
care about sometime that are nearby.

716
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
It's difficult.

717
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Yep.

718
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
It's true.

719
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
It's true.

720
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,040
I also sometimes think about how like those same people, like for example, like those

721
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,720
moms at work or whatever, who you can't really relate to, like if you, if you were to sit

722
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,600
down, like let's say you were just locked in a cave with them for no reason, like it's

723
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,440
one of those wacky situations where people get trapped in like a box together and you

724
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,600
learn like their whole backstory.

725
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Everybody generally has some pretty interesting shit to say about their life, but like, will

726
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,680
you get that while stalking Kmart shelves next to them, you know, for several days?

727
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Yeah.

728
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
That is the question.

729
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Maybe not.

730
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Maybe not.

731
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,480
I've always had like dreams and thoughts like that, like, ah, if only, if only me and my

732
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,840
class were locked on a desert island, I would be able to make a friend or two.

733
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Yeah.

734
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Yeah.

735
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
But it's impossible.

736
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,640
You just, you can't do it in real life because life isn't structured for that sort of thing.

737
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Everyone's moving too fast and there's always things to do.

738
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,760
You just got to get drunk and hang around people and maybe they'll open up and then you'll find

739
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
out that they're interesting.

740
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
That's true.

741
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,360
But putting yourself in as many of those situations or you lose your wallet and you're fucking

742
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
out.

743
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Oh God, I lost everything.

744
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,920
Oh God, Nate, you have to call our parents and tell them that they need to get up the

745
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,360
device manager app and find out where my phone was last time.

746
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Okay.

747
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
This is the first time hearing of that.

748
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I can do that.

749
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Well, I've been meaning to call you, but I can't because I don't have a phone.

750
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,000
Every time I think about it, I tap my pocket and I'm like, oh no.

751
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,520
That is a truly nightmarish.

752
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,720
Okay, remind me after and I will do that.

753
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,360
The one saving grace was that I, the one thing I didn't lose was my debit card because apparently

754
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,280
I had already given the bartender my card to open a tab with.

755
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,720
So when I lost my wallet, the card was not in it.

756
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
So that's something I used.

757
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Thank God.

758
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,360
At least you can still spend capital.

759
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,520
If you can't do that, what good even are you?

760
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
You're not barely doing that.

761
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I had like 30 bucks in cash in my wallet.

762
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
No.

763
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,080
I'd be more annoyed by just the sheer loss of like a license.

764
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
I have to get that.

765
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Yeah.

766
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Yeah.

767
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
I have to read.

768
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Yeah.

769
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
That is worse.

770
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
I have to reapply for, I have to get another driver's license and shit.

771
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
Yeah.

772
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
You better hurry, Ben.

773
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
If you don't have an ID for Radcon, you're fucked.

774
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
You're not going to be able to get on the flight.

775
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
I mean, that is true.

776
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
That is true.

777
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Oh, fuck.

778
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
That's true.

779
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Better.

780
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Yeah.

781
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Get on that.

782
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Get on that.

783
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Do you keep your passport in your wallet?

784
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
No.

785
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
We don't do that.

786
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
We don't do that.

787
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
No, not a passport, but my driver's license, my ID.

788
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
You will need an ID.

789
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Yeah.

790
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,640
I have a totally different topic, but I did want to discuss because I am passionate about

791
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
it.

792
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
All right.

793
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,400
Preface, I'm going to say the word.

794
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
I'm going to say the R word, everybody.

795
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Are you ready?

796
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Here it is.

797
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Right.

798
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Deliratory.

799
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Responsibility.

800
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Roster fag.

801
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Roster fag is the word.

802
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Oh, yeah.

803
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
That's right.

804
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Smash bros, everybody.

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Smash bros.

806
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Oh, we were talking about this.

807
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I hate.

808
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Yeah.

809
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Okay.

810
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,360
Be me, little old bestie boy, watching the stream for the new exciting reveal of the

811
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,440
new, the final fifth climactic crowning jewel, no doubt, on the DLC pack.

812
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
And it's the new fucking fire emblem guy.

813
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,840
I mean, Jesus Christ, just kill me right now.

814
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Like, okay.

815
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,120
Like people want to defend like, like fire emblem people want to defend it.

816
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,480
They're like, no, they're not really all the same guys.

817
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,600
Like if you've played the game, you know that they're all different.

818
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
They're the same.

819
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,040
These people, these people must understand that they are the freaks, right?

820
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,280
They're like, they know, you know, delusion is a powerful drug.

821
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,560
As a fire emblem husk, I can't really think.

822
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,800
I can't call myself a fan because I've been, I've been destroyed by the series so many

823
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
times.

824
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,400
But like, you know, games are all right.

825
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,760
It's just sort of like completely divorced from what it used to be, what it used to appeal

826
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,920
to me as, but you know, regardless, the most annoying thing about fire emblem in smash,

827
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,920
especially the fact that like they, like they know and they drew attention to the fact that

828
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:46,120
it's another sort of person with blue hair and they think that like what they did was

829
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,960
a good enough way to differentiate it and it fucking isn't.

830
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
It just isn't.

831
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
It's a blue haired lord.

832
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,360
It's exactly the same person.

833
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,520
But like the worst thing about it is not like super smash brother.

834
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I don't even have a switch.

835
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't care about the game.

836
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,400
It is how fire emblem in the, in the culture, you know, the pop culture of smash huge game.

837
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,640
So many people know smash and the overexposure of fire emblem over the years has made people

838
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,800
think fire emblem is fucking stupid.

839
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,160
Statistically speaking, let me just, just to render, there are games as well, like being

840
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,960
more of like anime waifu bullshit.

841
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
No doubt.

842
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
No doubt.

843
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,200
It's like some of my favorite games of all time are being buried under two different

844
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,080
layers of like, like dismissal.

845
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Obfuscation.

846
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Yeah.

847
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Look at these stats.

848
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,440
The most, uh, uh, representatives from anything.

849
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,400
There's like, there's like 11 Mario characters.

850
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
I think I'm not counting Yoshi.

851
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,760
I think there's like nine Pokemon.

852
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,020
But then there's, there are now eight fire emblem characters.

853
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,080
And I was looking over statistics just for the record.

854
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
People are like fire emblems doing better.

855
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Okay.

856
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
True.

857
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,800
I got none of this is my real case, but it's just funny to look at like individual games

858
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:04,040
from like Final Fantasy and, uh, and Pokemon and like even like Call of Duty, like individual

859
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,880
games and Mario, of course, have sold more than the totality of the fire emblem series.

860
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,800
So to pretend that like in terms of like popularity, that these are like, it deserves eight slots.

861
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
There's no case to be made.

862
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah.

863
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
It is a fact now.

864
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I really likes fire emblem.

865
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Look, he really likes it.

866
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,720
He, uh, apparently he didn't get to decide who was going to be in, which just even more

867
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,920
makes this feel like a cynical corporate decision.

868
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,260
Like there's, this is the fourth, the fucking fourth fire emblem character that is put in

869
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,220
specifically to shill a new fire emblem game.

870
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,020
But wouldn't this, wouldn't the cynical corporate decision be to put in something from a more

871
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,820
popular franchise?

872
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,620
Well, if there's a new game, there's a new DLC that's coming out like directly after

873
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,620
this is announced.

874
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,620
It's a cynical corporate decision in order to make products be sold of certain things.

875
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
Yeah.

876
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
They're trying to boost the fire.

877
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
The fire emblem game.

878
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,620
The smash bump is insane.

879
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
I mean, so many people learn about fire emblem.

880
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,660
I mean, most people learn about fire emblem probably through smash.

881
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Like back in the day.

882
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
No doubt.

883
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Back in the day, there were no fire emblem.

884
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,500
There was like fire emblem for GBA.

885
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
That was rare.

886
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,380
Like I don't think I, I literally don't think I knew what fire emblem was before they started

887
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
showing up in smash.

888
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,780
I am so fucking angry.

889
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:19,020
I have seen so many comments of people like, you know, like on YouTube things, like the

890
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,780
the only reason people know what fire emblem is is because of smash and everyone was like

891
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,100
thumbs up is like, yeah, this smash does everything and I'm the only one I think the only one

892
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,180
I know who got into fire emblem first, yeah, yeah, because it was good because it was a

893
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,900
I saw it in a magazine and it's like, oh, this looks cool and it was.

894
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,260
I was so smart back then.

895
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
You were smart.

896
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,260
You were a smart boy.

897
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
No doubt about it.

898
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,540
See, my, my thing is like, particularly people were pissed about not Dante not being in smash

899
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,060
with this reveal because like some hints that looked like on the same day there was a Devil

900
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,940
May Cry announcement from the Devil May, they were like, oh, keep this date in mind.

901
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
Why would you do that?

902
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,620
For Devil May Cry and everyone was just like, oh, it's happening.

903
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,620
It's gonna be and instead they're just like, oh, Devil May Cry 3 on switch will have real

904
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,460
time style switching like the new games and it's like, oh, we can do that on PC for the

905
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,780
last like four years.

906
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,620
Like, I don't care.

907
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,180
So it's like you made a mod paid on switch.

908
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
Good job.

909
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:22,380
And it's just like, well, the uber boner killer, just like the one two punch of just, everything's

910
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
bad.

911
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,260
We've talked about this a little bit before, but like, so we said that like, they were,

912
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,820
they do do the thing where they're like, oh, just another enemy swordsman.

913
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,980
We're sick of that.

914
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,700
What we'll do for you is do the thing that I assume the character can do in game, which

915
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,460
is like, this is one of the things like every five of them character is kind of like dedicated

916
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,580
to one set of weapons or maybe two or something.

917
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,540
I'm assuming that like what makes this main character different is that they can use a

918
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,220
variety of all like the both the axes or hammer or whatever and spear and sword.

919
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Okay.

920
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Okay.

921
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,220
But, but Nate, Nate, yeah.

922
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,100
Think about this.

923
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,060
If only there was another, uh, relevant character that like switched weapons and wasn't primarily

924
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,020
a sword guy, maybe a real war red trench coat, you know, I'm just saying, do you think maybe

925
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,780
it started as Dante and they're like, wait, we need to push fire emblem.

926
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
There's a costume.

927
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,500
There's a costume for the female one that has a white hair, a red trench coat, like

928
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
black pants.

929
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Oh, get fucked, Nintendo.

930
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
It's like my car.

931
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
It's an eldegard thing.

932
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Like there's a character in fire.

933
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
But it doesn't look just like Dante.

934
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I don't, I don't even care.

935
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
I just hate you.

936
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
All right.

937
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,620
I was so close to actually giving a single solitary shit about smash and you took it

938
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
away from me.

939
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
It was almost that.

940
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,020
Do you think, do you think, uh, a preferable one would have been like a goomba?

941
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,900
Dude, it could have been anybody.

942
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,220
The fire emblem meme is so tired out.

943
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,380
Like it could have been, you know, goomba, goomba for me.

944
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,380
Let's just take the, the example case of goomba.

945
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:50,460
I would like goomba more because this, this choice of fire emblem feels so cynical to me.

946
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:56,380
It feels so like corporatized, uh, like, we know Sakurai likes fire emblem, but like

947
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,940
he said himself, he was not the one who decided who was going to be in the game.

948
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,300
It was decided that it would be by Nintendo.

949
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,460
They're the ones who chose and they chose like the per, there is no personality.

950
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,580
Like okay, they're a teacher.

951
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,300
That's like one plot element or something.

952
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
It doesn't matter to anything.

953
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,820
Are they just silent protag or something?

954
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
Yes.

955
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
They are a silent protagonist.

956
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
That's correct.

957
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,820
And it's just another.

958
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,660
It's not like this is the first fire emblem character, right?

959
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,620
This is the millionth, I mean, I wouldn't even go into how annoyed I was by like the

960
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,260
direct itself where he was describing like the gameplay of fire emblem through the ages.

961
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,100
Like there aren't seven other characters in the game already.

962
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
We don't need that.

963
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Okay.

964
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
But that, that aside.

965
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Okay.

966
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,540
But I started this point with the roster fag, the word roster fag.

967
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,540
And one of the important, the, the main thing I wanted to say on this point was that I've

968
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,340
been being called a roster fag a lot.

969
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,980
And it's true by the description of the term roster fag as in people who primarily care

970
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,340
about like who gets in and like representation as opposed to like gameplay.

971
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I mean, that's absolutely me.

972
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Okay.

973
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,340
But, but the thing is, like if you're just accusing people like me who primarily care

974
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,500
about inclusion and stuff because I view smash as a greatest hits, even Sakurai himself

975
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,940
said in the stream, smash has become something more.

976
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Celebration of gaming.

977
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
Exactly.

978
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,940
And it, it so is.

979
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,940
So Digi, you're wrong about this whole animation.

980
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,140
Keep them out of my fucking games.

981
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
I don't want Goku.

982
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
I don't want Naruto.

983
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
No, I agree.

984
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Fuck that.

985
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Nah.

986
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Goku was cool.

987
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,140
I think Goku could.

988
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
I like Goku.

989
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,500
But in terms of, in terms of like all anime, in terms of all anime, I think Goku is the

990
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,460
only one who, who could fit.

991
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,380
But anyway, um, fucking wait, what were you saying?

992
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
I was going to.

993
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,740
Well, I mean here, I'll just keep it.

994
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,980
You can feel free to interrupt anytime.

995
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,780
But like I was, I was saying that those people who are just calling me a roster fag, one

996
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,980
person said I was like, like a child on my thing.

997
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Okay.

998
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
I think so.

999
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:53,220
Um, but their point, rather my point is that like if, if you primarily care about who gets

1000
00:39:53,220 --> 00:40:00,060
in, like the, the gameplay is totally secondary and can be customized in any way you want

1001
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
to be.

1002
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,820
People are like, oh my God, like a bileth or whatever has like so many amazing moves.

1003
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,380
Like that's what I care about.

1004
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,740
And I'm over here like, look, Sakurai tailors the moveset to be whatever he, it could be

1005
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,380
anything for almost any character.

1006
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,180
That is no diff, at the very least that does not exclude if Goomba got in, Goomba could

1007
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,380
have the exact same moveset as Violet.

1008
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,300
Like it's unthinkable that like some other character could have like a, you know, like

1009
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
forward moving.

1010
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
A long side B.

1011
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Like like attack canceling.

1012
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Exactly.

1013
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,300
Stun or something.

1014
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,300
Exactly.

1015
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:40,700
It's, um, intellectually dishonest to assume that somebody is mad about a character, um,

1016
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,820
like doesn't have the capacity to understand that the game could be the same, whether

1017
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,140
or not that character is in.

1018
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,020
It's not about the game.

1019
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,220
It's about, you know, the celebrate like everyone loves the reactions to smash, even if they

1020
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
don't play it.

1021
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,500
For me, that's the most important thing, but that's just like, I went nuts when I saw

1022
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
King K.

1023
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Rule because I like him.

1024
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,740
He's a cool character and he hasn't been in the games and it's like, you know, he got

1025
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Ganon.

1026
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
You got Bowser.

1027
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Why not?

1028
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,740
And then there he is.

1029
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
And it's like, yeah, cool.

1030
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,900
So everyone thought King K. Rule is dead.

1031
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,100
He'll never return to gaming like he's a deceased character.

1032
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,260
And then in like the most important game of our generation, he just bursts forward in

1033
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,660
beautiful HD rendering.

1034
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,580
I would never have expected them.

1035
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:24,820
Like nobody knows a shit about King K. Rule and why would they do it, but it's kind of

1036
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
cool though.

1037
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,060
It's such a different like question.

1038
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:34,620
Like smash character based on like gameplay and like tournament and like viability and

1039
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,380
where are they going to sit on like the meta and just like, it's not even, it's kind of

1040
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,340
like, here's an announcement, we're going to talk about this video game and everyone

1041
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,540
who likes that video game is like YouTube reviews.

1042
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,780
It's like nobody goes to a review to learn about a thing.

1043
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,020
They just go to see that the thing they like is being called cool and they're like, yeah,

1044
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,460
I feel cool now.

1045
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,860
They just want to say, yeah, my favorite thing.

1046
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,260
That's why everyone has like ridiculous unrealistic expectations and they hold onto them because

1047
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
it's fun.

1048
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,620
It's fun to like imagine like, wouldn't it be so fucking cool if Swans was getting into

1049
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
Smash?

1050
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
That'd be so fucking funny.

1051
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:17,300
And you know, he got in kind of, it's like, it's a community experience, more so than

1052
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,220
a video game thing.

1053
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,220
Nobody cares about the balance.

1054
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,580
I mean, people who play it professionally obviously do and you know, casually a little

1055
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
bit.

1056
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,180
I mean, it's exactly like Endless War.

1057
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,740
Nobody gives a shit about the video game.

1058
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
It's all about the community.

1059
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,740
It's all about that community engagement.

1060
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,420
It's, you know, because I know that like a lot of people, because I've done Smash streams,

1061
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,020
like obviously I've made it kind of a part of my thing and like I've done tournaments

1062
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
and stuff.

1063
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,900
So like I know there's people even in that little community who like way, way more care

1064
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,820
just about gameplay.

1065
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
And that's fine.

1066
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,340
I just don't think that that in any way does anything to exclude like my additional and

1067
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:58,700
kind of totally separate concern about like how I want Smash to be a celebration of like

1068
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,700
classic games.

1069
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,260
That's why like for me, like I understand if everybody else disagrees.

1070
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,820
But for me, the number one character as like it would be such a magical like re-experiencing

1071
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,860
of my childhood considering how dead he's been would be Gino, because Gino just represents

1072
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,580
so much about like my childhood and the games I grew up playing, it would mean so much to

1073
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,580
me.

1074
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,260
Dude, I was thinking about Gino the other day.

1075
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
Yeah.

1076
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,820
I started crying.

1077
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,820
It was amazing.

1078
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,820
It was amazing.

1079
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,820
It is amazing.

1080
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
It is amazing to think about.

1081
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,740
I was just thinking about Gino sometimes I'm like, wow, I can't fucking believe it.

1082
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,220
It's Gino.

1083
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,540
That game is so good and I don't know.

1084
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
I want to play it again.

1085
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,020
Gino is so fucking cool.

1086
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,020
He is a...

1087
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,020
He is.

1088
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Like, do you get...

1089
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,980
Hey, viewers, you fucking Zoomers who don't even know what the fucking like Gamecube was

1090
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,540
your first like games station like fuck off.

1091
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,060
At this point, it would be the Wii at the very...

1092
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,060
Yeah.

1093
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,060
Yeah, it would.

1094
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
It would.

1095
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,060
That's right.

1096
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,060
Insane.

1097
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:05,900
Gino is literally like a fucking like angel from like beyond space for who is like here

1098
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:11,020
on earth on like a holy quest to like retrieve the seven stars and like repair the fucking

1099
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,660
rainbow road or whatever.

1100
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,260
And he inhabits this body of like a wooden puppet superhero and uses his fucking like

1101
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,500
cool superhero guns and shit.

1102
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
So like...

1103
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Dude.

1104
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:27,260
To like assist Mario fucking Mario and Gino and Malo the cloud prince on their fucking

1105
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,260
quest.

1106
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,260
Blast the fuck out of other goombas.

1107
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,740
Shoot laser beams and shit and like bullets and so fucking cool.

1108
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,060
The Zoomers play Mario and Luigi and like Paper Mario and actually those are probably

1109
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,060
too old for them.

1110
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:43,540
But like those games, the Mario RPG since the OG Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars,

1111
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,820
there's always been like star characters or like there's like a little like starly

1112
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,820
glittering thing.

1113
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Like that character is...

1114
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
But all of that...

1115
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Dude, yeah.

1116
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
Like owes its existence to Gino.

1117
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,820
Like that's okay.

1118
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,820
Because he was so hype and so based.

1119
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,820
Okay.

1120
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,780
Like the stars, like the star spirits are cool.

1121
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,620
Like they're in other Mario games.

1122
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,620
Like I'm kind of glad that...

1123
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,620
They're nothing compared to Gino.

1124
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,620
I'm kind of glad that they stuck around.

1125
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,620
I've seen them.

1126
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
I've played them all.

1127
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,300
But never have they ever been a tenth as cool as fucking Gino.

1128
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
No.

1129
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
No.

1130
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
Just that's why he should be in.

1131
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,100
Just like the raw concept of what he is is like so awesome.

1132
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Indeed.

1133
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,020
Indeed he is.

1134
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,780
So that's our pitch for Gino getting in.

1135
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,780
And so we Sakurai wants it.

1136
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,380
I know Sakurai hasn't mentioned him in many years.

1137
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,380
I believe Brawl.

1138
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,340
He said like he wanted Gino in for various reasons they couldn't do it.

1139
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,900
But I mean Cloud's in, a million third parties are in, they're six, six.

1140
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,740
More character slots are open.

1141
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,740
Come on.

1142
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,740
One of them's got to be Gino.

1143
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,740
One of them.

1144
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,740
When are they going to put in Seda from Dark Cloud?

1145
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,820
When are they going to put in Madotsky from Yume Nikki?

1146
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,060
When are they going to put that Altillir Alchemist with the thick thighs?

1147
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
That's the one that all the kids are screaming about.

1148
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,860
When are they going to put in Altillir Heidi?

1149
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,740
Dude, when are they going to put in O'Cami?

1150
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,740
When are they going to put in O'Cami?

1151
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,740
Yeah, Fortnite.

1152
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,420
Can we get the, you know, some of those Fortnighters, just get them in.

1153
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,420
Can we get Ninja's new skin in Smash and Fortnite?

1154
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,420
That sounds good.

1155
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,380
Can we get Ninja's skin in like the physical release?

1156
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,380
Like his actual skin?

1157
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,900
Can we get Ninja's skin like in my closet, like as a skin suit?

1158
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,940
That would be, that's you know, that's what I'm looking forward to.

1159
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,140
This is a threat made against his person.

1160
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,140
Take that to the police.

1161
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:23,220
Let me tell you a thing that I learned about Endless War that I didn't even know.

1162
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,300
You can kill people and you can scalp them.

1163
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,980
I knew this much, but you can take people's scalps and you can make leather out them and

1164
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,300
you can craft leather into couches to decorate your house.

1165
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,300
Oh yeah.

1166
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:39,220
So you can like make entire couches out of like people's skin if you really want to.

1167
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,980
If you want to kill like the same person over and over again.

1168
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,300
A celebration of video games?

1169
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,380
Can we get an Endless War assist trophy in Smash boys?

1170
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,380
Can we make it happen?

1171
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,620
Imagine the Endless War like stage with him in the background and like occasionally just

1172
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,260
shoot him with his bone ready beam.

1173
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,980
Take any map and make it green.

1174
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,980
Just you know.

1175
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,900
Green filter over the whole thing.

1176
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,100
I think you should be able to play as Endless War and you're literally just completely immobile.

1177
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
It's like a pillar.

1178
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,380
Yeah, you're just an obelisk.

1179
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,380
You cannot move.

1180
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,740
You just have various ways to shoot your bone herding beam.

1181
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,540
Yeah, that sounds good.

1182
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,020
Although it's not going to work against guys like Kirby.

1183
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,020
No bones.

1184
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,020
No bones to be.

1185
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,460
Oh God, what if Kirby eats Endless War?

1186
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,460
Oh no.

1187
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
No.

1188
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,180
His bones don't stand a chance at that point.

1189
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,180
Dude, then he gets slim.

1190
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,460
All right, enough of this circle jerk.

1191
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,460
The point is made.

1192
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,460
Yeah.

1193
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
Yeah.

1194
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,460
One thing.

1195
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
One more circle jerk.

1196
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
I have never about Fire Emblem.

1197
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:45,180
I have ever since Brawl, no Wii U, Smash, I've always resented the fact that they started

1198
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,860
doing the new Fire Emblem games.

1199
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:54,180
And they started that after, well, they started with GameCube and they skipped over the two

1200
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,580
best Fire Emblem games in the franchise who have no representation whatsoever.

1201
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
What about Lin?

1202
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,580
Seven and eight.

1203
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,860
Lin is like an assist trophy thing.

1204
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,860
It's not enough.

1205
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay.

1206
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,860
I would be even happier with a Wii fighter.

1207
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:17,540
But like, you know, her or Hector, Lin or Hector from Fire Emblem 7 and Ephraim or

1208
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,860
Joshua from Fire Emblem 8 would be like, maybe not Joshua because he's a sword boy,

1209
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,060
but he's a very cool sword boy.

1210
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,980
He's a red and black sword boy.

1211
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,740
That sounds really cool.

1212
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,700
But Ephraim is like a turquoise lance boy and it's like...

1213
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,260
Wait, did you say Ephraim?

1214
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,260
Yeah, Ephraim.

1215
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,260
It's the same name.

1216
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,700
Is Ephraim named after Ephraim from Fire Emblem?

1217
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,700
You know, the...

1218
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Yes.

1219
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
His parents played the game.

1220
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
They loved it so much.

1221
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,420
Ephraim is just a real name that exists in the real world.

1222
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,780
The guy in Lighthouse is named Ephraim.

1223
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,740
The guy in Lighthouse is named Ephraim.

1224
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,740
I guess so.

1225
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,740
Ephraim.

1226
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,740
Yeah.

1227
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
Okay.

1228
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,740
Fair enough.

1229
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,300
Is that Ephraim's Christian name that God gave him when he was born or is that...

1230
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,300
No.

1231
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,300
No?

1232
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,300
No?

1233
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
No?

1234
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Okay.

1235
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
All right.

1236
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Just checking.

1237
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,300
Never mind.

1238
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,300
But yeah, like I've always thought like...

1239
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
Yeah.

1240
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,900
Like Hector, big ax man, like Berlin band, like different sort of build, Ephraim.

1241
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
It'd be a heavy.

1242
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:15,660
Turquoise hair, most important, different color hair, like either of those would be great

1243
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,300
and it's just always been said to know that those games, because of how much Fire Emblem

1244
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,540
characters there are, I can't in good conscience hope for Hector to get in because at this

1245
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,260
point any Fire Emblem character will be laughed out of the theater.

1246
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,580
I will be beaten to a pulp if I say I want Hector in Smash because there are too many

1247
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,460
and now like they're not...

1248
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,980
Unless like Fire Emblem 7 has like a remake and they do it again, it's not going to be

1249
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,980
a new game.

1250
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,820
There's no reason for them to put Hector in.

1251
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,700
So it's doubly disappointing.

1252
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,100
I hate everything.

1253
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,940
I have low hopes for the future of Smash games beyond this because we know things are going

1254
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,140
to be cut back so much.

1255
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,180
This game is like an anomaly.

1256
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,980
But like if they cut like everyone except like, like Marth, and I'll give them one other,

1257
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,580
take your pick, any of the others, if they do that, then I can be like, okay, you can

1258
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,540
put in a new Fire Emblem, no problem, put in like Hector, that sounds sick.

1259
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:14,420
I think Marth, Ike and Roy was a good trio of Fire Emblem because they were all different

1260
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,980
play styles, different things about them.

1261
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,980
That's true.

1262
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,980
That's true.

1263
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,380
But now we got so many fucking duplicates.

1264
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,380
It's insanity.

1265
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,380
Do you know even...

1266
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,500
How many of these guys could just be Echo Fighters?

1267
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,740
I mean, well, one of them is an Echo Fighter, Lucina is a clone, right, as opposed to an

1268
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,740
Echo Fighter?

1269
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,740
Or is she an Echo Fighter?

1270
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,900
I don't fucking know.

1271
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
I forget.

1272
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,900
It's a nightmare.

1273
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,900
I don't know.

1274
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
It's a nightmare.

1275
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,700
I remembered something that I think people will be hyped to know.

1276
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:51,620
It's about the RFCK Lecture, but in the proud tradition of me injuring myself at these

1277
00:50:51,620 --> 00:51:02,060
things, I injure myself in the middle of it, in the RFCK Lecture, I suffer a physical

1278
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,820
injury to my body, which I continue to have to this very moment.

1279
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,820
Wow.

1280
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,580
Ben is just such a killer, he has to try and kill himself constantly.

1281
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,660
I like that hook.

1282
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,660
I want to know and find out what body part is injured.

1283
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,260
I won't say what happened, but I get injured.

1284
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:23,340
Remember when I broke my fucking foot at Red Con 2?

1285
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:29,220
It's kind of like that, but like, funnier, but like sadder.

1286
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,380
And the show goes on, I assume, beyond this.

1287
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,580
Oh yeah, no, I don't fucking, I don't, I never give up.

1288
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,700
Excellent, excellent.

1289
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,340
And by the way, I was going to say one last thing about Byleth, which was just, I always

1290
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,460
say I'll be happy with any character, so like, I'm always happy to have a new character,

1291
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,740
but given the limited slots is why I have some reservations here.

1292
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,860
Well, I mean, now we know that the slots are not limited.

1293
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,860
They could just keep doing this forever.

1294
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,180
But there could have been seven good characters, instead of six, that would have been better,

1295
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
you know?

1296
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Yeah, I mean, there's already characters that I've never played ever in Smash, and I don't

1297
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,780
You know the truly sad thing, though?

1298
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,780
I mean, that's true.

1299
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,580
The truly sad thing, actually, I've gone, like, as a result of, like, Smash and everything,

1300
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,820
I've played Fire Emblem, I've played Earthbound, I've played Mother 3, I've tried to find most

1301
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,820
of the obscure ones.

1302
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,820
I like to do that stuff.

1303
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,260
Like, after playing, or after listening to, or reading the JoJo manga, I like went and

1304
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,500
listened to like all those albums that things are named after just for fun.

1305
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,660
But anyway, I was just going to say that, like, I was thinking a little bit about getting

1306
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,980
this new Fire Emblem, and tragically, based on, unfortunately, considering everything

1307
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,780
I've said, I kind of want even more to get the new Fire Emblem now, just so I know what

1308
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,780
the fuck's up with it.

1309
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,780
No, they got you.

1310
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,780
I know, see, it's working.

1311
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
They got the fucking hooks in you.

1312
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,780
All right, here's the explanation.

1313
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,100
It sounds like a comfy game to play, and because this isn't like, this is Baby Mode

1314
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,860
Fire Emblem, it's not like I have to worry about, like, actually playing a hard game.

1315
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,380
This game, you can grind infinitely, you can train up, oh, it sounds relaxing, so.

1316
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:02,100
I just seen, I saw a lemon tart player when he was in London, and he explained that, you

1317
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,420
know, you can put, you can change, you know, back in the day, it was like a narrative story

1318
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:16,620
where, you know, each level is a map, and you have to use strategy to get your way to

1319
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:22,620
the end with losing zero people, hopefully.

1320
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:28,100
Fire Emblem is now morphed into a game that is less about, you know, serious strategy.

1321
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,700
I mean, there's lots of options, but you can easily make a character OP, or like min

1322
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:40,460
max to heck, and you can also marry them, and I don't know.

1323
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,740
I mean, he likes it, I could see it, the appeal.

1324
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,740
But he likes-

1325
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,980
All the girls are terrible.

1326
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,980
There's no good ones.

1327
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,980
Convince me otherwise.

1328
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,980
You can't.

1329
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,980
I'm just saying compared to other girls, this series, they're just, they're so normal.

1330
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1331
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,980
The whole series, you got Lynn, you got Florina.

1332
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Okay, Lynn is great, but-

1333
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,980
Florina is very good.

1334
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,980
There's definitely a few others I can't think of the moment.

1335
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,980
I mean, I like Eldegard, sure she's cute, whatever.

1336
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,980
Okay, never mind.

1337
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Like, the one with the pink hair in the new game, she's pretty cute, I guess.

1338
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,980
No, no, no, new game bad, I hate new-

1339
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
Oh yeah, right, sorry, my bad.

1340
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,980
But yeah, the new game is fine.

1341
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,980
I think I might go get it to play in my bed.

1342
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,980
There's certain things about the graphics that repulse me, just the fact that-

1343
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
The loss of sprites has been such a blow.

1344
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:39,980
I mean, that's one thing, but I saw in battle, you have a bunch of faceless, nameless subordinates surrounding your party, your character, and they look so cocky-pasted.

1345
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,980
Is the implication that you control-

1346
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:49,980
Does that imply that all along in Fire Emblem, it's actually been not a one-on-one fight with literally 10 troops on the board?

1347
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,980
It's actually that each person controls a squad and then they-

1348
00:54:52,980 --> 00:55:08,980
I can imagine that was more of the point, because graphical and technological abilities were not capable of showing that many things on screen earlier on.

1349
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:13,980
Well, I mean Fire Emblem started a lot earlier and there was kind of a political legacy to-

1350
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,980
Okay, that's true, that's true.

1351
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:33,980
Once they were focusing on individual animations for the characters, adding a bunch of extra people on is sort of like, you have to animate them and make them do things, but now they have the resources to do that, but it still kind of looks cheap and lame and I don't like them being there.

1352
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,980
But that's just a mean thing.

1353
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,980
Just stop putting them in Smash, just cut it out guys. Please say Psych. Please say Psych, Sakurai.

1354
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,980
I'm waiting for it.

1355
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:56,980
We were saying during the stream like, alright, this is a misdirect. Goku is gonna spirit bomb them to death and Goku's gonna be confirmed. I cannot wait, but it did not happen. I'm still waiting.

1356
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:04,980
But from what I've heard, Byleth as the main character is like you and therefore is no personality at all.

1357
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,980
Just like Robin, just like Robin in the other one. It was just like a tactician with no personality.

1358
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,980
That's the thing, I played Fire Emblem Awakening.

1359
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:23,980
I think they did have lines. They have lines. They do say things. They have their own character. You are not literally them. You've changed what they look like, but they have a story and an arc and a character and a personality.

1360
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,980
Whereas this one is literally you. It's just a blank.

1361
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,980
Yeah, as far as I understand. I mean, I may be wrong on that as well.

1362
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,980
But anyway, fuck it. Who cares? Fire Emblem sucks.

1363
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,980
Yeah, you're right.

1364
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Can you believe we got, okay, I know it was like a meme. Honestly, this is the most angry that I get. Not Byleth. Byleth I kind of understand.

1365
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:47,980
The fact that it became a meme that Robin got in and not Crom and then they put Crom. Just no. Who cares about Crom? I fucking hate Crom.

1366
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,980
He's the worst inclusion in Smash of all time as far as I'm concerned.

1367
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Crom.

1368
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,980
The meme that he deserved to get in was never true. Ever. I hate Crom.

1369
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:04,980
Crom is definitely the golden of Fire Emblem Smash.

1370
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:10,980
He's like the fat Pikachu. No, not the, he's the new Pikachu. He's the Pikachu with the heart on its tail.

1371
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,980
The female Pikachu.

1372
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,980
A damn diversity inclusion and it's bullshit.

1373
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,980
Yeah, all right, there's my case.

1374
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Moving on. I mean, I'm tapped. That's what I wanted to mostly talk about.

1375
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,980
You didn't even mention starting to go donate to Radcon for?

1376
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
What else is going on?

1377
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,980
We can go to voicemails anytime if you want.

1378
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,980
I played Terraria on RFCK stream.

1379
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,980
Oh, I'm a big fan.

1380
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,980
And that was real fun. And I've been playing it since.

1381
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,980
Yeah.

1382
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,980
I've been on my own just getting a whole lot of cool stuff.

1383
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
I got so many sick dies.

1384
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,980
My character wearing a white wedding dress.

1385
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,980
I gave her like a shimmering gold die for the wedding dress.

1386
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,980
So now she's like super incredible.

1387
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,980
And I got like a cool cape with like a shimmery purple obsidian die for that.

1388
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,980
And like a red acid die for her goggles.

1389
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
And it's like, I'm the coolest guy of all time.

1390
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,980
Get a screen cap when you get it.

1391
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,980
Multiplayer Terraria on Roddy Fricker's cop killers has been really fun.

1392
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,980
And like, I'm glad we're doing it and I want to do it forever.

1393
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,980
Building slime base.

1394
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,980
Maybe I'll get into it too.

1395
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,980
Yeah, you should. You should join a game.

1396
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,980
I do love Terraria. I just haven't played in a long time.

1397
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,980
We're building slime base and it looks really cool.

1398
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
I've got so much slime.

1399
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,980
When I come back, you'll have so much slime, including pink slime,

1400
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,980
because I killed a few pinkies.

1401
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,980
Nice.

1402
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,980
Oh, gross.

1403
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
Man.

1404
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,980
Disgusting, Roddy.

1405
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,980
Shit.

1406
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,980
Okay, understand.

1407
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,980
It's bouncy, bro.

1408
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,980
Yeah, I mean, it's cool.

1409
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,980
It's cool for what it is, I guess.

1410
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,980
Yeah, dude, slime base.

1411
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:52,980
I also got some like, this purple obsidian shimmery purple die is so killer.

1412
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
I have some spare so I can give you some.

1413
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,980
Did you give me the shimmering gold die for my slime mount?

1414
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,980
And like, it looks really cool.

1415
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,980
It looks like it's like gold embossed.

1416
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
I think Munchie gave you that.

1417
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
Okay, but it looks really cool.

1418
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,980
It looks like foil.

1419
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,980
This is very nice.

1420
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,980
A lot has changed since I last played slime mounts and all these dies and shit.

1421
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,980
Dude, writing your slime mount around is like a game changer.

1422
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,980
Jumping on things heads with your slime mount is like the best attack you have.

1423
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Sick.

1424
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,980
They've got this thing now where in your world, they either have corruption

1425
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,980
or they have the crimson area, which is the equivalent,

1426
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,980
but it's slightly different and it's got like a Cthulhuid brain boss

1427
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,980
if you smash the things at the bottom.

1428
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,980
And I'd never seen it before and it was like really cool.

1429
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,980
Wait, is that in...

1430
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,980
Oh, it sounds like it's really...

1431
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,980
Is that in the RFCK game?

1432
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,980
No, no, it's in my world.

1433
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,980
I was expecting the corruption as usual with the flying guys,

1434
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,980
but instead it was like this red tunnel of blood down into the depths

1435
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,980
and all of these weird like gross brain spiders and it was...

1436
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Remember your first time creating your...

1437
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,980
What do they call them?

1438
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,980
They call it a stage, your boss stage, like down to fighting your first wall of flesh

1439
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,980
and you make a super long one.

1440
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,980
I've never done one.

1441
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,980
I've never gotten that far.

1442
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:11,980
No?

1443
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,980
Because I used to play by myself.

1444
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,980
Oh, it's good.

1445
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,980
Oh, it's good stuff.

1446
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,980
I always play alone because I'm a lone wolf.

1447
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,980
But I kill them all with my guns and shit.

1448
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,980
We kept trying to summon that like corruption worm

1449
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,980
and he just kept despawning for now.

1450
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,980
He would just come and we'd fight him and he would just...

1451
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:26,980
We were too high up.

1452
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Yeah, he would just go away.

1453
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:29,980
And we'd be like, no, come back.

1454
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

1455
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,980
Why?

1456
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,980
That's some bullshit.

1457
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:33,980
Mm-hmm, lame.

1458
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,980
You gotta plan for these things.

1459
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
Anyway, Tora is a great game.

1460
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,980
Even if it's not 100% flawless with all its bugs and stuff.

1461
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
I'm getting the shakes.

1462
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,980
It's pretty cool.

1463
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,980
I forgot it was good, but it is.

1464
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,980
Hey, what about the Minecraft server?

1465
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,980
It's fixed, right?

1466
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:48,980
Oh, good news, everybody.

1467
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Minecraft server is back up.

1468
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,980
We fixed the issue.

1469
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,980
Thank God.

1470
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
All is well.

1471
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,980
All is well.

1472
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,980
I was afraid you were gonna be like,

1473
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
actually, it's never coming back.

1474
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Oh, okay.

1475
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,980
You know what?

1476
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
I'm glad you mentioned that.

1477
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,980
It took some doing.

1478
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,980
We had to actually get in contact with the server host.

1479
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
With Minecraft itself.

1480
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,980
With Mr. Minecraft.

1481
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,980
He called us on the phone.

1482
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,980
He said, boys, this PCP server's been raking it in for me.

1483
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,980
I can't leave you boys hanging.

1484
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,980
We're gonna be kind of at juicy pay.

1485
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,980
Anyway, they basically told us what was wrong.

1486
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,980
It was like a setting thing that was causing the problem.

1487
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,980
He fixed it for us.

1488
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,980
We know now what it is.

1489
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,980
It should never happen again.

1490
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,980
We have, in fact, upgraded Pixelmon.

1491
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,980
All the Pixelmon stuff is what we want to do from the beginning.

1492
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,980
All is well.

1493
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,980
Minecraft is up and running.

1494
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,980
I was doing my Nuzlocke stream yesterday.

1495
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,980
At the beginning, I'm like, okay, let's go play Nuzlocke.

1496
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:47,980
I load into LOL Minecraft, the server, as I go run over to Lumia's graveyard that she's

1497
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:53,980
built outside Cool Guy Village, AKA Gay Guy Village for all the deceased pokes.

1498
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,980
Oh, it's beautiful.

1499
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,980
Oh, and down in the basement, there's a little fire pit for the voicemail god.

1500
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,980
Future home of the voicemail god in this tomb.

1501
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,980
It's glorious.

1502
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,980
I can't wait to lock him in there forever.

1503
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:11,980
Now I can continue my quest for a giant Volcarona with a modest nature.

1504
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,980
The Holy Rail.

1505
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,980
One day.

1506
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,980
Maybe would breeding them be a fast way to get them or something?

1507
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,980
Probably yes.

1508
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,980
There's probably ways to...

1509
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,980
I wonder if I could get an Everstone.

1510
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,980
That's how you control free nature.

1511
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,980
You get one with the nature that you want, and then the offspring keeps the nature.

1512
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,980
Something like that, yeah.

1513
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,980
There's ways to do it.

1514
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,980
I've never really fucked with it before, but I guess I could.

1515
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,980
Excellent.

1516
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
Excellent.

1517
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,980
I was talking to Gib about this on Twitter.

1518
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,980
We went back and forth a little bit.

1519
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,980
I started playing Okami HD a few days ago.

1520
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
Holy fuck.

1521
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,980
Alright, that game is incredible.

1522
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,980
What are you playing it on, by the way?

1523
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,980
What system?

1524
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,980
PS4.

1525
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,980
I found it on eBay for $5.

1526
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,980
I thought that was a worthwhile use of money.

1527
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,980
The last game I just played through was God of War.

1528
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,980
The PS4, God of War.

1529
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:19,980
It blows my mind that this old PS2 game, just scaled up to 1080p,

1530
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,980
just looks so much better than God of War.

1531
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,980
That's fucking artistry over realism, guys.

1532
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,980
I've been banging on this drum for years,

1533
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:31,980
and they didn't have to do anything to make Okami look better

1534
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,980
than every game that's ever come out in the history of the world.

1535
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,980
I hadn't thought about how much that game would definitely appeal to you

1536
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,980
of all people.

1537
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,980
Dude, it's like perfect.

1538
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:42,980
I remember Okami.

1539
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,980
Okami was fucking awesome.

1540
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:44,980
I'm playing through it.

1541
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,980
I'm trying to reverse engineer and figure out how they did all the fucking cool shit.

1542
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:53,980
When I realized all the trees are sprites, they're not models,

1543
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,980
but then when you do the fucking Zendatsu basically thing

1544
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,980
and cut them, they turn into polygon models to fall over.

1545
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,980
This game must have been so resource intensive for a PS2

1546
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,980
because the way they do the outline thing is that they duplicate all the meshes

1547
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,980
and make them transparent so you can just see the outlines around them.

1548
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,980
Everything has double the polygon count it needs to in order to make that outline work.

1549
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,980
They use sprites all over the place to cut down on the polygon headroom.

1550
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,980
Oh, it's fucking gorgeous.

1551
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,980
It's amazing.

1552
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,980
I love it so much.

1553
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:35,980
Just thinking about seeing a black tree with the little white ribbon around it

1554
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,980
and being like, oh, it's another one.

1555
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,980
I haven't done that one yet.

1556
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:42,980
Get the brush out and turn it into Sakurai.

1557
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,980
The first time I did the bloom power on the big Sakiya sapling thing

1558
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,980
and it does the whole cutscene where all these flowers just come out,

1559
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,980
I literally came.

1560
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,980
I was like, this is the best.

1561
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,980
Why did we...

1562
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,980
I just stared at Kratos' volcano pores that they had to have on all of his body

1563
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,980
for 15 hours and it was the worst.

1564
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,980
This is just five polygons and it's pure artistry.

1565
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,980
I've had it in games so much.

1566
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,980
Fuck this bullshit.

1567
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Oh, it's the worst.

1568
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
I know that was a clover production.

1569
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Was that Kamiya?

1570
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,980
It was. Kamiya was the guy.

1571
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,980
Kamiya.

1572
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,980
Kamiya is the build of the boy himself.

1573
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,980
Why is Matthew Matosis going to make a Kamiya review?

1574
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,980
That's a good idea.

1575
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:30,980
After watching his beautiful Joe, because it seemed like beautiful Joe...

1576
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,980
I think Game Grumps played it for five minutes and I was like,

1577
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,980
this sucks. This doesn't look good.

1578
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,980
But after watching Matthew Matosis' video, I suddenly understand and appreciate it a lot.

1579
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,980
Dude, I loved beautiful Joe back in the day.

1580
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,980
I watched that video recently too. It was fucking sick.

1581
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Huh.

1582
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,980
Yeah.

1583
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:53,980
And so knowing that that is the same people who would go on to do clover and be Okami...

1584
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,980
Didn't the studio immediately die after Okami?

1585
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,980
Capcom killed them pretty quick, which sucks.

1586
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Yeah, it sucks.

1587
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Awesome.

1588
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,980
They made a sequel, Okami Dan, which is not as good, but it's still kind of cute.

1589
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:11,980
Did you see the tweet from Kamiya posted a couple months ago saying that he wants to do a sequel to Okami

1590
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,980
and they're pushing to try and get platinum to be able to make it?

1591
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,980
And I'm just like, if they do that, I will come in Ocean.

1592
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,980
It'll be the best fucking day of my life.

1593
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,980
Watch as they make it like super HD realism.

1594
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,980
That was originally what the game was going to look like, apparently.

1595
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,980
Holy shit, thank god they came to their senses.

1596
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,980
It was originally going to be a realistic game and they changed the aesthetic.

1597
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,980
The original announcement trailer, I guess, has realistic graphics.

1598
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,980
Ew.

1599
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,980
Yeah.

1600
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,980
They fucking saved themselves.

1601
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,980
That was the thing at the time.

1602
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,980
Look at what we can render with today's technology.

1603
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,980
That's like an equivalent of how Star Wars was fixed in editing.

1604
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,980
Talk about like a saving grace, like later in production or something.

1605
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,980
But like, the game's just so fucking good.

1606
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,980
I can't believe, like aesthetically it's just so on point and the mechanics are great.

1607
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,980
It basically has Zendatsu from Metal Gear Rising before Zendatsu with the brush.

1608
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,980
And you can like slice things in half and it's fucking sick.

1609
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,980
And I'm just going around just like, what can I cut in half?

1610
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,980
Like cutting rocks in half, cutting trees in half.

1611
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,980
Where are you in the game right now?

1612
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,980
I just got to the second big area, the forest area.

1613
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:17,980
And I got to go into the dungeon and save the kid's dog.

1614
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,980
Oh, you will love the boss there.

1615
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,980
I'm ready.

1616
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:21,980
I'm ready for that.

1617
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,980
I just fought Wakka.

1618
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:23,980
I just fought Wakka.

1619
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:24,980
Okay.

1620
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,980
I love how Kamiya like has nods to Devil May Cry and like every game he does.

1621
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,980
Cause like in Bayonetta, she says some of the cheesy one-liners that Dante said, like

1622
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,980
flock off Featherface and you're fighting Griffin.

1623
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,980
And then in Beautiful Joe, Alistair is like Dante's sword from the original Devil May Cry.

1624
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,980
And that's a boss in the game.

1625
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,980
And in this one, you know, Wakka's just like, let's rock baby, which is Dante's fucking catchphrase.

1626
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,980
I'm just like, Dante is everywhere.

1627
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,980
Everybody's Dante.

1628
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,980
It's great.

1629
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,980
I love it.

1630
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,980
Give me more references to the best game ever made.

1631
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,980
Maybe I should play fucking Devil May Cry because I love Wakka so much.

1632
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,980
Dude, Devil May Cry 1 is so good.

1633
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,980
I can highly recommend it.

1634
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:58,980
Absolutely.

1635
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,980
I should get it.

1636
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,980
Is that like a HD like collection of them?

1637
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:02,980
Yeah.

1638
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,980
It's on PS3.

1639
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,980
It's on PS4.

1640
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,980
It's on Switch.

1641
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,980
You got, you got options.

1642
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,980
You can go anywhere.

1643
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,980
It's like a dollar.

1644
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,980
It's fucking sick.

1645
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,980
Real good.

1646
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:11,980
DMC1.

1647
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,980
Classic.

1648
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:13,980
The definitive.

1649
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,980
Holds up.

1650
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,980
It holds up.

1651
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,980
Yeah.

1652
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,980
But like after, after Beautiful Joe, I'm, I'm, I'm hoping and praying that Mathematosis

1653
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:25,980
does a big analysis of Okami because it would be the biggest, like, um, like I haven't,

1654
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,980
I haven't seen a review of Okami that was good enough to be like, you don't really get

1655
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,980
it.

1656
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,980
You don't, you don't really smart enough to, to explain the feels on display here.

1657
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,980
Yeah.

1658
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,980
I like Okami way more than I like Devil May Cry and I never played Beautiful Joe.

1659
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,980
And I don't think I'd like it that much.

1660
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,980
I feel a little bit the same about Beautiful.

1661
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,740
I watched much of his video and I was like, yeah, this seems nice.

1662
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,980
It doesn't seem like the game because I'm not really, I'm not, I'm not that into brawlers

1663
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,980
and stuff.

1664
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:54,980
I mean, that's my job.

1665
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:55,980
Yeah.

1666
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,180
The reason, I took me forever to play Okami because like the way people would pitch it

1667
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,980
to me, they were like, it's like Zelda, but you're a wolf.

1668
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,980
And I'm like, well, Zelda's gay, so I'm not playing that shit.

1669
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,980
There was, there was literally already a Zelda where I was a wolf.

1670
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,980
Right.

1671
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:09,980
Oh yeah.

1672
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,980
It kind of is like the whole like ranking system in fights as well.

1673
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,980
Have you tried doing the thing to get the blue fangs?

1674
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,980
Yeah, I figured that out.

1675
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,980
It was fucking sick.

1676
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,980
You just got to like slice the body while they're dying and you get the fucking demon fangs.

1677
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:21,980
I'm like, yeah.

1678
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,980
So like, like style points for, for doing things like each, there's a bunch of different enemies

1679
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:31,980
and they all have specific brush techniques that cause them to be getting the blue fangs

1680
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:32,980
from them.

1681
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,980
Yeah.

1682
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:34,980
Yeah.

1683
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:35,980
And I was just like, I was like, I was thinking like playing it in the beginning.

1684
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,980
I'm like, this is pretty good.

1685
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,980
I'm like, it's definitely the combat is meatier than Zelda.

1686
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,980
And when I saw Hideki Kamiya's, like, oh, maybe this won't, this will be like fun.

1687
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,980
And then I go to the dojo and like the guys, this old man's like, I'll teach you new techniques.

1688
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,980
I'm like, they're, they're combat upgrades in this.

1689
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,980
And then the dude's head like flips around and it goes from an old man to like a fucking

1690
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,980
badass old man.

1691
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:56,980
And he like teaches you the moves.

1692
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:57,980
I'm like, oh, this is the best game ever made.

1693
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,980
10 out of 10.

1694
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,980
Hey, wasn't, isn't there a thing in that game?

1695
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,980
I think this haunted my nightmares for a long time.

1696
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:07,980
It's like during loading screens, you can like mash buttons to like get items that like,

1697
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,980
I mean, they keep every moment is technically gameplay, including loading screens with that.

1698
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,980
But then I remember haunted me and I like, I fucked up trying to get all those very

1699
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,980
difficult.

1700
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:18,980
I don't know.

1701
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,980
I think who was it?

1702
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,980
Like copyrighted that.

1703
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,980
And then they, they had to take it out of the HD version.

1704
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,980
What?

1705
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,980
Yeah.

1706
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,980
It's in the PS2 and we, I think, but like, you can mash the button to get the, to get

1707
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:33,980
the blue fang if you like tap the button enough times to get the pause to appear.

1708
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:39,980
But in the HD version, which I also have, they got rid of that because of like somebody

1709
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,980
copyrighted that as a game mechanic because they wanted to keep it.

1710
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,980
That sounds like EA.

1711
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,980
It sounds like an EA move to me or an animation move.

1712
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,980
But yeah.

1713
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,980
Okay.

1714
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,980
That makes sense.

1715
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,980
Cause like my friend Ashley, who's super fucking into Okami, she was telling me about the

1716
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,980
minigame and I couldn't get it to work because I'm playing on the HD.

1717
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,980
I was like, what am I doing wrong?

1718
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,980
Now I know it's just been taken out.

1719
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,980
Like if I was playing that game, I would be mashing too.

1720
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,980
And I would be like, what the fuck?

1721
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,980
I, there's no like, what do you, should they put like a disclaimer at the beginning of

1722
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,980
the game so that people who have played previously know?

1723
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:12,980
I think it just doesn't, like you press the button, in the minigame you press the button

1724
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:17,980
the dog port appears and you have to make like 20 of them appear before it loads.

1725
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,980
And I think now you press the thing and it doesn't appear.

1726
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,980
There's nothing that happens.

1727
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,980
That would make sense, man.

1728
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,980
Okay.

1729
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,980
Well, fair enough, fair enough.

1730
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,980
That's too bad though.

1731
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:27,980
That's too bad.

1732
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:31,980
That's just like, if I want to play that version of Okami again, what are my options?

1733
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Emulate the PS2 game.

1734
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,980
Emulate or just have the PS2 version.

1735
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:36,980
Or just own it, yeah.

1736
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,980
Which I'm sure I do somewhere.

1737
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,980
I will say I have the PS2 version as well because I accidentally bought the PS2 version

1738
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,980
at the same time because I ordered a fuck ton of PS2 games last week on eBay.

1739
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,980
I just was like bye, bye, bye, bye.

1740
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,980
Like I'm just in a bad mood.

1741
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,980
I guess I'm doing shopping therapy right now.

1742
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,980
And I played the, I started up the PS2 one just to see the difference.

1743
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,980
It's so much better to play it in HD just because like, I'm not a huge advocate of HD remakes

1744
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,980
because I think it's just like milking it.

1745
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,980
But like this aesthetic benefits so much from additional pixel counts.

1746
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:10,980
Like it's not like, it's not like something like, you know, like another PlayStation 2 game

1747
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,980
like Shadow of the Colossus where like it's cleaner.

1748
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,980
But it's, you know.

1749
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:19,980
I remember it on a CRT and it looking good, but yeah, it definitely looks better in HD.

1750
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,980
Right, playing these, playing these on like a CRT would probably still be good.

1751
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,980
But like when you, because I have like PS2 component cables and everything to try and make them look

1752
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:32,980
as good as possible on an HDTV, it's still not even close to running a native 1080.

1753
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:40,980
Here at Slime, here at RFCKCon, Spidey's got like a switch, I think, or a Wii or something with like games.

1754
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:46,980
And there's like, she's got like N64 games that are like hacked for widescreen.

1755
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:52,980
And it's really funny that you like, they look like total shit because they're not designed to be viewed in widescreen.

1756
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,980
Like they're playing like war, like some like Wario game, like a 3D Wario.

1757
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:01,980
And like on the edges of the screen, like polygons and objects, you will just be blatantly like

1758
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,980
popping in and popping out, even though they're not like, even though they're not that far off the screen,

1759
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,980
just because like they're past, yeah, they're past the borders of what would have been displayed at the original resolution.

1760
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,980
Dude, if you can get a picture of that or like some footage, I would love to see that.

1761
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,980
That sounds fascinating.

1762
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:15,980
That would be really interesting.

1763
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,980
I wish I had a phone, lol.

1764
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,980
Oh yeah, maybe a bar or something.

1765
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,980
Oh, how unfortunate.

1766
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,980
And then, okay, it was even funnier.

1767
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,980
A Paper Mario, a thousand year door.

1768
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,980
Like, you know how a lot of that game is like letterbox, like there's black bar at the top and the bottom?

1769
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,980
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1770
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,980
Well, like, that's only as wide as the original screen.

1771
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:38,980
So like, it's just, the black bar just stops and like,

1772
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,980
It's just a black rectangle.

1773
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,980
Then there's just a full screen after that.

1774
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,980
Yeah, yeah, the outer, like the edges of the screen are full, are full-sized.

1775
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:45,980
They're not letterboxed.

1776
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,980
That sounds like the worst way to play any video game ever.

1777
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,980
And when there's like a screen transition, that like the screen is supposed to flash white,

1778
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:56,980
only like the center, like 4x6 rectangle flashes white and like the edges just don't do it.

1779
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,980
It's very funny.

1780
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,980
I would just rather play it in the original version.

1781
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,980
Yeah, no, no, obvious.

1782
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,980
Like, this is not meant to be released.

1783
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,980
This is like a hacked version.

1784
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,980
This is a naughty commercially released product.

1785
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:10,980
Well, right, right.

1786
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,980
I wouldn't do that hack if someone gave me the option.

1787
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,980
Well, I mean, if that's how you're gonna play it on the Switch, it might be the only way.

1788
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,980
Oh yeah, I guess so.

1789
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:18,980
Or maybe not, I'm not sure.

1790
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,980
Oh, disgusting.

1791
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,980
Just fucking hack my Switch.

1792
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:21,980
I've heard people doing it.

1793
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,980
I haven't hacked a system in quite a while.

1794
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,980
Surely there's got to be like an option.

1795
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:31,980
It would be easy to include an option to just like put black bars on the side so it's not an HD.

1796
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:35,980
I mean, like at this point, I don't even know if I'd even bother hacking my Switch,

1797
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,980
just because like technology has gotten to the point where you can go on like AliExpress

1798
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:45,980
and get like a $100 handheld that'll play everything up to like N64 for like under a hundred bucks.

1799
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,980
And it's just like, I'll just get that.

1800
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,980
I don't have to worry about firmware updates.

1801
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,980
It's like undoing the hack.

1802
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,980
It's just like, it's just designed to do that.

1803
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,980
Yeah, yeah.

1804
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:55,980
Makes sense.

1805
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,980
Makes sense.

1806
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,980
Good old AliExpress.

1807
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:58,980
Thanks, Chinese.

1808
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,980
Copyright don't mean nothing.

1809
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,980
I agree.

1810
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,980
Like half of them just ship with like all the Super Nintendo games on there already.

1811
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,980
And it's just like, hilarious.

1812
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,980
Fascinating.

1813
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,980
All right.

1814
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,980
Well, what do you say we go on to voicemails?

1815
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,980
Let's do it.

1816
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,980
Let's do it.

1817
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,980
I'm going to do a quick demonstration about all kinds of stuff.

1818
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,980
And let me just remind everybody one more time, hit on over to that Kickstarter.

1819
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:23,980
Oh, before we go, I will say that the next thing on my list of play after O'Connor is

1820
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:28,980
I bought literally every Disgaea game except for the newest one because it was really expensive

1821
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:29,980
still.

1822
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,980
And I have no idea about the series at all.

1823
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
I just thought the art looked cool.

1824
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,980
And they were really cheap.

1825
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
Just go by the first one, Tom, and see how you like it.

1826
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,980
And then, you know, if you're into it.

1827
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:42,980
Here's, I played the first Disgaea in high school and I loved it.

1828
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:43,980
Like a lot of it was the aesthetic.

1829
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:48,980
It has a really cool aesthetic, but I was really into like the tactical grid based RPGs.

1830
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,980
I do like those kind of games.

1831
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,980
Yeah, I don't, I don't think I would like them anymore.

1832
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,980
I think I don't, I would not be as patient as I used to be.

1833
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:00,980
It sounds very dense, which kind of scares me, but at the same time, maybe I'll enjoy

1834
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:01,980
it.

1835
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,980
I don't know.

1836
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,980
But like, I played them.

1837
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,980
So I really like the first one, but I didn't do any of like the randomized dungeons.

1838
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,980
So I actually just kind of played like just the baby mode game.

1839
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,980
And then like, I got the, I got the next game.

1840
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,980
They made La Pucelle tactics and I thought it was so fucking lame and boring and I hated

1841
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,980
it.

1842
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,980
It was way worse.

1843
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:20,980
It was way worse.

1844
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,980
And I never played another, another, it's Nipponichi, right?

1845
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,980
Is this the studio?

1846
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,980
Yeah, that's them.

1847
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,980
And like, I never played, it was same with Dark Souls.

1848
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,980
Like, like the first one only played at once, played the second one, got bored was like,

1849
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,980
fuck it, never played another game in the series.

1850
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,980
Dark Souls 3 is so much better.

1851
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,980
Also Bloodborne and etc.

1852
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,980
Bloodborne is peak.

1853
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,980
And of course Sekiro.

1854
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,980
The best of the bunch.

1855
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,980
Well, the thing, Ben, interesting, I found out, because there was a game I almost bought,

1856
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,980
almost did buy.

1857
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,980
Why don't these companies, why don't these companies just stop making shitty second

1858
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,980
entries?

1859
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:49,980
They really should.

1860
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,980
They just skipped that one.

1861
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,980
There's another Disgaea called Disgaea D2, which is a direct sequel to Disgaea 1, has

1862
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,980
all the same main characters.

1863
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,980
It's like a continuation of their story.

1864
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,980
Yeah, I know they did, they did make direct sequels later, which I would have been slightly

1865
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,980
more interesting because they did not care about the world of La Pucelle.

1866
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,980
Like, all the actual characters, none of them have much of an arc.

1867
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,980
They all kind of just are their personality.

1868
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,980
It's like a comedy story, right?

1869
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,980
It's kind of just the time to take the piss.

1870
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:15,980
Yeah.

1871
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,980
Well, it's just like, when I devote like, okay, maybe 60s a bit much for a Disgaea game,

1872
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:24,980
but like 40 hours to a game, I'm just saying, I prefer when there's kind of like a story

1873
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,980
that compels me as opposed to like, basically the facsimile of a story with just like funny

1874
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,980
characters, because I'm telling you right now, the comedy is terrible.

1875
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:37,980
I did not think any of the writing was very good in like any of those games in Disgaea.

1876
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:38,980
Damn.

1877
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,980
The first one was the best.

1878
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:40,980
I remember liking it as a kid.

1879
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:41,980
It's downhill from there.

1880
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,980
I remember liking it as a kid, but yeah, it would probably come off.

1881
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,980
How many jokes do we need about Etna being insecure about being flat?

1882
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,980
Like how fucking many do I need?

1883
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,980
At least 50.

1884
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,980
At least.

1885
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:52,980
At least.

1886
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:53,980
That was their answer.

1887
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,980
One for every hour of game play.

1888
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:01,980
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

1889
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,980
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

1890
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,980
Oh, they're killing everyone.

1891
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,980
Everyone's dying.

1892
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:08,980
Thank you for the slime.

1893
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,980
I appreciate it.

1894
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,980
Slime.

1895
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,980
I think it's purple.

1896
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,980
It's good.

1897
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,980
Everybody get the fuck out of here.

1898
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,980
Get out of there.

1899
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:15,980
Get out of there.

1900
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:16,980
Sorry about the slime noise.

1901
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,980
This is why I don't play Endless War.

1902
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,980
Everyone's obnoxious as fuck.

1903
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:25,980
Every time you try the exclamation point podcast, it gets interrupted and you die.

1904
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,980
That was the sound of opening up Discord and seeing you have 40,000 notifications from

1905
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,980
people saying yo, SlimerNalia.

1906
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,980
You know what?

1907
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,980
That reminds me.

1908
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,980
All right.

1909
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:37,980
Let's go to the voicemail.

1910
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:41,980
Because the first thing we've got to stop by is we have some updates from our men on

1911
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,980
the street of SlimeCon 6, wherever the fuck it's called.

1912
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,980
So let's check in with them real quick.

1913
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,980
Of course, the speak pipe link is down below if you want to leave your voicemails as well.

1914
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,980
All right.

1915
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,980
Our first one here of two is from Iframe at RFCKCon.

1916
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,980
Let's hear what he has to say for us.

1917
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,980
Take it away.

1918
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,980
Hey, guys.

1919
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,980
It's me, Iframe, at RFCKCon 6.

1920
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:05,980
Hello.

1921
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:06,980
Hey, Iframe.

1922
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,980
And we're just out here talking about how Ben is the best PCP member on the face of the

1923
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,980
earth.

1924
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,980
Isn't that right, Ben?

1925
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:13,980
That's a first.

1926
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:14,980
I have beliefs.

1927
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,980
I believe in justice.

1928
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:16,980
I believe in justice.

1929
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:17,980
I believe in justice.

1930
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:18,980
Yeah.

1931
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
Who are you talking to right now?

1932
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,980
Hey, Coss.

1933
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:22,980
Coss.

1934
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:23,980
What is this?

1935
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:24,980
Ben St.

1936
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,980
Is this a PCP voicemail?

1937
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,980
This is a PCP voicemail.

1938
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
Hey, Nate.

1939
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,980
Hey, Nate.

1940
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,980
You better fucking play this.

1941
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:30,980
You coward.

1942
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:31,980
They're all fucking angry.

1943
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,980
Stop it.

1944
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,980
Hey, Nate.

1945
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,980
Stop it.

1946
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:35,980
All right.

1947
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:36,980
Well.

1948
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,980
I was tempted to not play for that long.

1949
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,980
Well.

1950
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:51,980
You should have just immediately turned it off as soon as I said that and be like, I'm

1951
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,980
the power play here.

1952
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,980
Sorry about that.

1953
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:55,980
Sorry about the loud noise.

1954
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,980
Peace out, bitches.

1955
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,980
I think that was Chad.

1956
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:00,980
Good old Chad.

1957
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,980
There you go.

1958
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,980
That's nice.

1959
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,980
Yeah.

1960
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,980
That's what it's like.

1961
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,980
Maybe I won't go after all.

1962
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
That sounds like you're not going to say anything.

1963
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,980
Dude, Tom.

1964
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:11,980
You should get the fuck over here.

1965
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,980
Immediately.

1966
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:16,180
You better fucking get here right now or we will come and fucking hunt you down with

1967
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,980
slime weaponry, the likes of which you've never seen.

1968
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:19,980
That sounds kind of fun too, though.

1969
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:20,980
Now I'm going to win my options.

1970
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,860
We love slime.

1971
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,860
We have another voicemail.

1972
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:26,860
Our second and final voicemail for Morse.

1973
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,860
Slime war.

1974
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,860
Slime war.

1975
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:29,860
Slime war.

1976
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:30,860
This one is simply called slime.

1977
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,860
Let's see what the people have to say.

1978
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
Here we go.

1979
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,860
Slime.

1980
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,860
Slime.

1981
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,860
Slime.

1982
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,860
Slime.

1983
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,860
Slime.

1984
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:38,860
Slime.

1985
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,860
Slime.

1986
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,860
Slime.

1987
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,860
I think this is from the protest.

1988
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:42,860
I think that's it.

1989
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,860
Wow.

1990
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:44,860
That's incredible.

1991
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:58,860
He's pushing like a rusty wheelbarrow while he's saying slime.

1992
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:04,860
He's coming back from the mines and he's singing his slime mining song.

1993
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,860
Slime.

1994
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,860
It's a great song.

1995
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:09,860
You just say slime really loudly.

1996
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:10,860
Slime.

1997
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:11,860
Slime.

1998
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:12,860
Slime.

1999
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,860
That feel when you got slime.

2000
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,860
Yeah.

2001
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:15,860
I've got slime.

2002
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:17,860
Let's get to the real voicemails here.

2003
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,860
Hell yeah.

2004
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,860
Links down below.

2005
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,860
Speak pipe.

2006
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,860
Okay.

2007
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,860
Okay.

2008
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:26,860
So first up, we've got a voicemail here of interest and this is reporting to you from

2009
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,860
YouTube claim hell.

2010
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,860
All right.

2011
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Let's see what we have to say.

2012
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,860
Go.

2013
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,860
Hey, PCP.

2014
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:33,860
I have a question for y'all.

2015
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,860
It's a voicemail god.

2016
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:39,380
So I'm wondering for anyone who's uploaded to YouTube, which I think that applies to

2017
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:47,180
most of you. What's been like your worst story or your just horror copyright story, videos

2018
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:52,700
getting claimed, that kind of thing? I just uploaded one of my first videos in a long

2019
01:21:52,700 --> 01:22:00,560
time and it was getting claimed every time. It took 8 re-edits of the same video, putting

2020
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,340
on different effects and transitions and shit just to get it through. So I'm wondering

2021
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:14,020
if you guys have a similar horror story, you know, maybe worse, maybe not as bad. Fuck

2022
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,220
YouTube, am I right?

2023
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:22,300
The worst time I ever had fucking with copyright was, it was actually via the me and digi debate

2024
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,380
on like Bernie vs Yang.

2025
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,820
Yeah, why's that?

2026
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:36,900
Well, just because I wanted to monetize it and I put it up and it would say it was fine

2027
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:42,220
but then I released it and it immediately went to not suitable for monetization. I ended

2028
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:47,580
up uploading like 5 different versions of it and just fucking around with each one and

2029
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:52,300
trying to be like, okay well I'll change the title in this one, I won't say the word

2030
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:57,460
versus because if I change that, and I would just try to change little inconsequential things

2031
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:04,140
and sometimes it would change whether or not it was monetizable but I think it was on a

2032
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,340
delay, like I think I would change something and then wait and nothing happened and then

2033
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,540
change something else and then it would go to be monetized but actually it was like the

2034
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:16,100
previous change that had done it and it just hadn't, so it took me, I spent like an entire

2035
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:20,820
day just like fucking with the title and the tags and re-uploading and re-uploading that

2036
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:25,540
video just to get it to be monetized. It did ultimately work but it wasn't fucking worth

2037
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,820
it because it got like 5,000 views so it didn't matter.

2038
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:35,340
Fair, yeah, that happens. I know that our boy, voicemail god Sean here is asking because

2039
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:40,060
he made a video like for the Nuzlocke where he won the rival battle thing but here was

2040
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:45,140
the problem. This is an interesting case study for a guy who's like new to making videos.

2041
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,100
He was like, it was like a seven minute long video and he put a lot of work into it but

2042
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:55,820
the problem was that the base footage was like audio of like what do they call it, don't

2043
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:01,220
say run from My Hero Academia and it was like a seven minute clip from My Hero Academia

2044
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:07,700
of the anime and anime people are ruthless with this shit and the audio so like the final

2045
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,580
version. You're totally fucked.

2046
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:14,220
You're totally fucked. So like the way, here's the big brain strats. Basically, first of all

2047
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,340
you can't use like big songs. You can only use like background songs none of like the

2048
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,540
big momentous which means you're fucked if you want to use it basically. You will get

2049
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:26,500
claimed most of the time. You got to use like no more than like 10 second clips at a time

2050
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:31,060
at most and you got to break them up and you got to maybe insert your own audio recreated

2051
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:36,660
or whatever. Maybe he's like an 8-bit remix of the song, whatever you got to do and you

2052
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:40,660
will just get fucking claimed over and over and over again but like his final version

2053
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:45,660
is hilarious. It's got like, it's got an overlay of like me holding my hand, my head in my

2054
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:52,620
hands over like the entire video. It's like tinted pink. The audio is like tweak to fuck.

2055
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:57,500
It's like painful to listen to moment to moment. It was just such an abortion was made of like

2056
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,620
the original quality of this thing to get it past the filters and you know what, in the

2057
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:06,900
end it did work. No one would ever claim this is a replacement for that original footage

2058
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,860
of My Hero Academia. This is definitely an original production. There's no doubt in

2059
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:19,180
So he did it. Good job on that for sure. Unfortunately, it was painful to experience for all human

2060
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:23,940
listeners, but YouTube had no problem with it. So there's a little advice there. I've

2061
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:28,860
had, I mean, fuck man, my old videos like the best anime ever, I've used tons of like

2062
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:32,300
copyrighted music and clips and stuff. They get claimed to shit. I don't even expect to

2063
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,940
make any money off of them, but keep your clip short. Don't use copyrighted music.

2064
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,340
I mean, I've got a lot of...

2065
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:41,100
Use covers of songs. That's a big stretch.

2066
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:47,820
I've got a really annoying one. I've got two, but the first one was, I think my mini

2067
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:53,180
clip video on Hippocrates, where for a short period there's like, there's a glitch where

2068
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:59,660
a guy won't die and I wanted to put like, who wants to live forever? This Queen song.

2069
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,740
But I was thinking, well, that's going to get claimed. I can't put Queen. So I found

2070
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,900
an eight bit version of it and I put that in. And the eight bit version got claimed

2071
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:13,180
instead as its own thing. So I'm like, oh, but I, you know, it came, that came up after

2072
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:16,460
I released it and I was like, well, I don't want to take it down, re-edit it with the

2073
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:23,060
real Queen. But now that I go back and watch it, it sucks because you, without Queen vocals

2074
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,900
there, it doesn't really work.

2075
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:29,660
Yeah. Yeah, it's so true. It's just like, we just have to deal with this reality. If

2076
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,220
we want to use copyrighted clips like that, like you can get maybe like five seconds of

2077
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:38,060
like, I don't know, a Justin Bieber song and get away with it, but not too much more than

2078
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,700
that. Yeah, that was the break.

2079
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:49,900
My second one was like, the fucking Kingdom Hearts one GRPJ, where like I had the music

2080
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:57,060
from, you know, the beginning, the pop song, I got claimed for that. Oh, the pop song.

2081
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,060
That'll do it.

2082
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:03,580
And it was incredibly long render time. And I was like, oh, oh no, because my computer

2083
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:10,780
back then was as good as I have now. So look, it took like another six hours to redo it.

2084
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:16,560
And I was like, that's a whole day that it's not out. And I hate it. I hate it. Rerendering

2085
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,060
is the worst part.

2086
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,060
It really is.

2087
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:24,100
You know, you know what's my, I think my number one worst story is probably the worst case

2088
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,260
scenario for me is when I have a video, it like appears to be fine because this can happen

2089
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,820
to you, especially if you work with anime a lot. You release the video thinking that

2090
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:37,940
there's no claims and then later it gets claimed for something that was in it. And like my

2091
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:42,540
biggest nightmare is the Chris Chan lecture will just like be claimed in the future for

2092
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,540
like no reason.

2093
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:46,780
Yeah. And I'll have to like re upload it.

2094
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:51,580
You see that that's what I'm getting at. It's that my my the original Gernlogin part two

2095
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:56,820
was not claimed. Like it was demonetized. It got claimed to that extent. I didn't give

2096
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:01,860
a shit. At least I'm pretty sure. Maybe I had monetized on it originally. But like something

2097
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,660
like a week or two afterward, it had accrued like 20,000 views. And for me, this is the

2098
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,580
very beginning of my channel. I was like, I was like, fuck, yes, I'm finally making a

2099
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:16,100
video that people like or that care about whatever. And then it was, I used like the

2100
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:21,420
ending song from kill me baby. Maybe people know that. I don't know. And that got claimed

2101
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:26,780
and it devastated me. And so what I had to do, I had no choice. I could eat, I tried

2102
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,740
to remove the audio, but it was totally fucked. I needed the audio there. I had to re render

2103
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:35,740
the video with a different song I got from somewhere else was like another anime song.

2104
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:41,020
And I uploaded just a new version of the video. And like I still feel bad about like all the

2105
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,460
comments and like stuff that was that's locked away in that old, by the way, you can find

2106
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:50,860
that old version if you go to like, I've got like a playlist on best care that's like,

2107
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:55,660
like the bad shit or like the old destroyed files or something like that. So that's the

2108
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:59,560
the one that everybody knows actually the second version. I was uploaded after this,

2109
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,880
which I still feel bad about. But hey, whatever. So when I have to like fix a project and re

2110
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,160
upload, that's the worst case scenario for me. So fix everything you can before you release

2111
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:13,160
it. I mean, if you can get away with using covers or eight bit remixes or just using

2112
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,840
video game music for the most part, that usually works. Those are much safer because

2113
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,440
audio is way easier to get tripped up on, especially after the fact that video. Yeah.

2114
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,360
Yeah. But then I mean, man, there's some instances, I don't know how long is clips

2115
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,760
or but like, remember when Digi just made that he made that video about girlish number

2116
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,040
as like his favorite video or like his favorite anime that he's and then it gets like, like

2117
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,000
months later, it gets copyright claimed and like gets a strike by the company, even though

2118
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,200
he's just like praising and he's not using like more than a few second long clips. They

2119
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,600
just don't. I think it's because they're Japanese and they just don't know what he's

2120
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,920
doing. They don't know how good this is for them. I don't know what it sounds like. It

2121
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,520
sounds like a lot of these these companies just hire someone else. Yeah. And they don't

2122
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,480
give a shit. They're just like, they're paying us to track all this. They probably get more

2123
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,680
money. The more claims they do, their paid per claim or something, you know, yeah, I wouldn't

2124
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,400
be surprised. I wouldn't be surprised. Okay. All right. Let's go on to our next voicemail.

2125
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:16,600
This is from frog drive. Let's see what frog drive has to say. Go. I'm at the gym being

2126
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:22,040
the most absolute Chad that I am. I'm taking a shower, hard workout. Then I suddenly can't

2127
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:27,920
resist it any longer. I reach down to my erect cock. My entire mind is overrun by the complete

2128
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,200
sexual excitement for the pace you pay dating sim. The thought of Nate's masculine body

2129
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:38,880
overwhelms me. I would always be safe in those big arms. Then the thought of the softness

2130
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,680
of munchies paints a onesie rouses me even more or give and take. I know it'd be very

2131
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:49,720
sensual with me down there based on his performance from his hit TV show, the last straw. And you

2132
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:56,640
know, Tom Oliver would be just as good. So good. He would only need one arm. And Ben, Ben

2133
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:03,440
would be the most slimy and dirtiest of them all. Bast. I open my eyes. An old man is

2134
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,400
watching me. I aim the head of my penis towards his face. He covers away. I continue thinking

2135
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,480
about the ravenous experiences I have with all the PCP members. Once the game is released,

2136
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:18,440
I'm getting near my climax in fantasy. I'm on the floor surrounded by the PCP performing

2137
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:25,280
a book hockey. They come on my face. I'm climaxing. But right as it happens, I visualize Vizipop

2138
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:31,440
performing nefarious acts on her dog. Oh boy. I'm disgusted with myself for coming from

2139
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:38,880
beastiality. This is the 15th time it's happened. I return home in a disheveled forlorn. Maybe

2140
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:45,880
once the PCP dating sim is out, I can finally come from a human experience again. Damn. Let's

2141
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:51,960
hope so. God. What a tale. What a tale of pathos. Well, best of luck. What can I say,

2142
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:57,840
but fuck yeah, bro. Hey man, February 14th. The dating sim is out. I think I think that's

2143
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,760
the right date. It's less than one month away. Goodness gracious. Shit. We should definitely

2144
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,600
play that. Next up. At Radcon 4. Yeah, I think we should. Oh, you're so right. You're so

2145
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,000
right. No doubt. At least for like one live stream or something, we should like live stream.

2146
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:18,120
It's mandatory. It's a great idea. Like we'll us chat or the PTA to tell us who to fuck.

2147
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,320
Great idea. Great. Oh yeah. That's the perfect thing for the PTA to win. Our decisions. Yes.

2148
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,400
Yes. You know, just to encourage everybody out there, hey, you can always up your pledge

2149
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,880
if you want to go into the PTA to be part of these things that we're talking about. Do

2150
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,240
not be afraid. There's probably maybe like 10 people at like PTA or above right now,

2151
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:42,680
but we want to thrive in community. I think there's like maybe more than that. Yeah, there's

2152
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:48,320
in the teens, I think. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Hey, by the way, hey, by the way, last, I

2153
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:53,920
was just looking at, I was looking at some stats. Radcon 3. First day, it raised about

2154
01:32:53,920 --> 01:33:00,560
2,000 in some. And on the second day, it was up to like 2,500. Yeah. We are in the middle

2155
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:06,840
of our second day. First day, we raised almost 6,000. Today, we've raised like, we're up

2156
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:13,120
to 7,500. And it's only like 5pm. Can I just point out, we started this at 87%. We are

2157
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:21,120
now at 90%. We've gained like 150 or 200 bucks just like during this hour. We need 800 more

2158
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:25,420
dollars to reach our goal. 800 dollars. Is this what it feels like to be Jeff Bezos?

2159
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:29,200
Just making money, just like sitting around doing nothing. Like without even noticing.

2160
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:35,840
Yeah. It feels good. We'd better start thinking of some pretty good stretch goals. Oh, indeed.

2161
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:42,400
We've got a few good ones. Calendar at 111111. I mean, the people as suspected are going

2162
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,960
gangbusters for both the OVA. And I've seen quite a bit of buzz about the calendar as

2163
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:52,800
well. Yeah. We can make some. I think the people want the calendar. I agree. God, I'm

2164
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,680
going to have to pick out like what anime character I am. Yeah, I know, right? The guy who just

2165
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,080
left the last voicemail, he's going to be stoked for the calendar. You better be pledging,

2166
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,080
dude. Oh, I've got some great ideas. Oh, I've got some great ideas. Oh, is this how it

2167
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,280
feels? The joy of being an ethot? Like, oh, I get to be this sexy anime. I think it is.

2168
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:17,680
I think it is. We're tapping into a new market here. It's sound, it's perfect. It's perfect

2169
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:25,520
for us. Okay, next one up. This voicemail is from, okay, this is Alternative. Alternative

2170
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:33,600
as a Nate, BGE, breadest guy ever. Let's, let's hear what he has to say. Take it away.

2171
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,680
Go. Capitalism. When I step back and think about it, it is, it is concerning to me. Some

2172
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:43,800
of the things I'm noticing. We're commodifying things like handshakes. This is going to hurt

2173
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:49,280
people who buy into this shit even a little bit. How do you not realize you're being fucking

2174
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:55,000
played by the system? You are nothing. You will never be anything. It's about the destruction

2175
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,120
of innocent people who are in a society that takes advantage of them and commodifies human

2176
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,680
interaction. God, I think you want to fucking kill myself.

2177
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,640
All true. All true. Nate, when did you become cool?

2178
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:15,720
I did that rant on a canton about an anime and it was, it was really cool.

2179
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:21,920
I released a highlight video of, of basically of this like 20 minute long discussion about

2180
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,440
this anime with a little addendum at the end, but we'll, we'll link in the description.

2181
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,920
So it's, it's just like this part. It's the first couple of minutes are, are this main

2182
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,960
discussion here about this new anime that Ben, I mean, you should check out at least

2183
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,280
the first couple minutes of, of our discussion. It is.

2184
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,000
What is the, what's the anime? So it's, it's called, the English name is like, if my favorite

2185
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,760
pop idol made it to the Budokan, I would die. But it's like, oh, she got Budokan.

2186
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,480
It sounds like a fucking nightmare, but go on.

2187
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:56,840
It is. It's about an idol. It's about the main character is a super fan of an idol group.

2188
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,480
And the thing is, she's like obsessively into it and she's making many, many life mistakes

2189
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:07,000
in like, she's throwing so much money away. She's got like no other friends. I mean, to

2190
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,240
me, her life appears to be spiraling downward fast and it's deeply concerning. But like

2191
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:17,720
the anime presents it in like, she, she's a really pretty girl like the main, as opposed

2192
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,680
to all the other super fans are gross guys, but it's okay. Our main character is a pretty

2193
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,480
girl. So it's actually really nice guys.

2194
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,480
I see.

2195
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,080
And, oh my God, what made me want to fucking pull the trigger.

2196
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,520
This does look fucking horrifying.

2197
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,080
It is horrifying. The last thing that, I'll just spoil this for everybody. The last thing

2198
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:36,400
that happens in the episode one is that it's heavily hinted that while it looked like the

2199
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,080
idol that our main girl is so obsessed with actually is like creeped out by her, fittingly

2200
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:47,480
so. She is absolutely a creeper and it's unhealthy. Ben, secretly, capitalism works because actually

2201
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:51,080
the idol is in love with her biggest fan all along.

2202
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:55,560
Oh my God, I knew it. I knew it could happen. And I knew it could be me.

2203
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,080
Just like it could happen with me and my favorite Twitch ethot. If I keep pouring the money

2204
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,000
on them, she will love me.

2205
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,400
Just keep patroning.

2206
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,400
That's right.

2207
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:07,560
The PCP, they will love me back.

2208
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,160
It's basically just the worst case scenario. And like it's played off. I think it's supposed

2209
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:16,200
to be a comedy, but it's too real. It's too fucking real and it's uncomfortable to watch.

2210
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,200
Yeah.

2211
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,280
Sounds nasty.

2212
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,320
It is very nasty. But you know what was interesting? I was thinking about this, Ben. It was that

2213
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,560
a lot of people heard my rant and were like, yeah, Nate's a commie like me now. I like

2214
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,120
him now. He's good.

2215
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,120
Sad.

2216
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:35,680
But the main thing was I approached this. I think we arrived. Me and the bread boys

2217
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,480
arrive at a similar position of this situation is extremely fucked up. But I'm thinking

2218
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:46,520
about like all the guys. And like there's one girl, but let's be real. It's mostly

2219
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:51,960
guys, like almost entirely. And this pretty girl is a fantasy. I feel so sad at seeing

2220
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:57,000
these guys make such horrible mistakes. Like all the people calling the PCP asking for

2221
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,480
romantic advice or whatever, at least those guys are like trying. These guys have given

2222
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,080
up and are just like, I'm just going to throw money away on idols. And it's so sad. And

2223
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:09,580
I want these people, I want these kings to lift their head so that their crown does not

2224
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:10,580
fall anymore.

2225
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,920
You don't understand.

2226
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:18,400
So whereas I think a lot of other people approach it or you know, this crowd is like, you know,

2227
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:24,640
the abuse of the idols and like the frankly, the idols are complicit in this fucking system.

2228
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,240
And I have very little sympathy for them.

2229
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,360
Well, well, I mean, I mean, I'm sure it's I'm sure it's not like the best for anyone.

2230
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:36,560
Indeed. That's the real thing. That's the real thing. And it's so weird. Like the idols

2231
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:42,440
in the show are like way into this like obviously parasitic social dynamic.

2232
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,520
Because they're making fucking bank.

2233
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,600
I mean, they are making bank, no doubt. But they let the fans so close to them. Someone's

2234
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,520
going to do something one day. Oh God, it's a powder keg about to explode.

2235
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,960
No, dude, they're making bank though.

2236
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,440
Well, keep it up, girls. Keep it up. It's working well so far.

2237
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:08,080
All right. Anyway, so go check that out, everybody. Great anime, Oshiga Budokan. The most

2238
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,640
intellectual anime of the season. No doubt about it. Sounds Kino.

2239
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:18,480
All right. One more voice. Oh, thank God. We've heard enough from these. We've heard

2240
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,080
enough from these freaks. We actually have three. Okay, my mistake.

2241
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:28,200
It's all right. We'll go faster here. Keep it together, lads. We're almost there. Okay,

2242
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:32,760
this one is from Don't Let The Masks Live.

2243
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:37,760
This is from Pancakes Stuck Between Ben St. and A Hard Place.

2244
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,040
All right. Let's go. Take it away.

2245
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,440
Hey, PCP. I just pulled a big Ben St. Yikes yesterday.

2246
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,560
Oh, no. And I was hoping you'd give me some Sage advice.

2247
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,560
Deep cringe posts?

2248
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:53,760
So I was out and about shopping when I saw this nice girl and I wound up turns it, hey,

2249
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,760
you look nice. Big mistake.

2250
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,880
I could tell that she was very flustered about it, so I was just going to leave and take

2251
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:05,880
a big rip on my bait. But then she stopped and said, hey, you know, like, vaping's bad

2252
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:13,560
for you, right? So I pulled out my gun and slid into her fat, gaping yapper and said,

2253
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:19,600
you know, bullets are bad for you, right? Long story short, she's in a trunk, so I

2254
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:24,440
was wondering what my options were. I don't think I'm disclaims or anything, but I also

2255
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,560
can't let her get to the police.

2256
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,080
Finish the job, dude. Put the bullet in you.

2257
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:35,800
Are you me? That is literally me.

2258
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:44,000
If that were a scenario in the TPC procrastinator's dating sim, which I'm sure it is, or if it's

2259
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,840
not already, it now must be. I would have made all the exact same choices you did, so

2260
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,840
I'm proud of you.

2261
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:54,840
Dude, before you dump the body, check and see if she has Ben's wallet and phone. We

2262
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,840
still haven't had one.

2263
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:03,120
That's a great idea, great idea. Key items obtained, Ben's Saint's wallet and phone.

2264
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,120
No.

2265
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,120
No.

2266
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,120
Yeah.

2267
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,120
I miss them.

2268
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,640
Your wallet's going on a homestuck-esque adventure.

2269
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:16,360
Guys, my phone, my phone was the phone from BronyCon that got the I Love Poenut sticker

2270
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,360
on the back.

2271
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,360
Oh, right.

2272
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,360
And it's gone.

2273
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,360
The world's better off, frankly.

2274
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:27,800
Are you sure you can't, I mean, if you can use the thing to find a device, you could

2275
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,800
get it back, right?

2276
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,800
Maybe.

2277
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,800
Contact mom and dad. This can be done. I mean, I'll tell.

2278
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,840
They can use an app that will tell them when the phone was last sensed by the network.

2279
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:39,840
Right.

2280
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,240
Usually, a thief will power down the phone so it can't be tracked anymore, and then they

2281
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,720
hard reset it, which will wipe everything, and then they can just do whatever they want.

2282
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,640
Sure, but it might not have been stolen. You never know.

2283
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,640
It's worth trying.

2284
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:50,640
You know what?

2285
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,400
That sticker on the back, who'd want to touch it, really?

2286
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,800
It's worth trying, man. Come on.

2287
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,800
It's worth it.

2288
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,160
Yes, I said I was going to do it already.

2289
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,160
Okay, okay.

2290
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,160
Yes, yeah, I will.

2291
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,160
Why do you think he wants to wrap this up? He's got to find his phone every minute.

2292
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,160
The clock ticks.

2293
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:08,840
I've got to go back to that bartender and be like, I'm sorry, sir, please forgive me.

2294
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,920
Forgive me for imbibing alcohol at your establishment, sir.

2295
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,960
What if the bartender stole it, and he's just mad because he's covering up his crime?

2296
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,640
Real situation that you fall like the tracking device. Oh, it says it. What? It's in the

2297
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:25,160
bar. It points directly to him. Oh, God, he had it all along. What do you do, Ben?

2298
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,640
He just smirks at me.

2299
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,160
Try and take it, kid.

2300
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:34,080
Maybe I forgot to tip. Maybe I forgot to tip, and that's why he hates me. And he stole

2301
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,040
my phone for revenge.

2302
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,560
Can't blame him. Can't blame him.

2303
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,560
All right.

2304
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,560
He's been next voicemail.

2305
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,120
Cringe-posting on Twitter this whole time.

2306
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:45,960
I was going to say, the way I should play this is pretend someone actually stole my

2307
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,360
phone like a year ago, and I've just been cringed. It's just been someone else cringed

2308
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,480
and posting in my name this whole time.

2309
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,480
Oh, that would explain everything.

2310
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,480
Guys, I love Joe Biden.

2311
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,480
So I'm in punishment. You didn't do any of it.

2312
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,480
Klobuchar 2020.

2313
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:05,480
All right. Next voicemail from our old friend Sheepolution. All right. Take it away. Go.

2314
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,480
Hello.

2315
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,480
Hello.

2316
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,480
I am excited about Redcon 4.

2317
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,480
Same.

2318
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,480
I would like to donate to Redcon 4.

2319
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,480
Same.

2320
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,480
I don't have a credit card.

2321
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,600
Kickstarter only accepts credit cards.

2322
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,600
How do I donate?

2323
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,600
Yeah.

2324
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,600
Redcon 4.

2325
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,600
This is a horrible problem.

2326
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,440
This is a horrible problem that plagues every Kickstarter that has ever existed, and I do

2327
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,440
not know why they haven't fixed it.

2328
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,440
There is no solution.

2329
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:33,440
I mean, somebody came to me and said, Nate, I want to do it via PayPal.

2330
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,440
Is there anything to do?

2331
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,440
Yeah.

2332
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,440
I don't know why.

2333
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,440
I don't fucking know why Kickstarter doesn't accept PayPal donations.

2334
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:44,440
Even if, like, technically it is possible for us to get your money, but we need Kickstarter

2335
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:47,440
to get to the goal for things to come.

2336
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,440
Like, here's the solution.

2337
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:54,600
I mean, if it gets over the goal, it's possible, but then if there's like so many people, we'd

2338
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,440
have to do all the management for that.

2339
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,440
I mean, I'm not saying we're going to use-

2340
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,440
That's not even that hard.

2341
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,440
We can do it.

2342
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:05,160
I did have, like, a window after the Vapors 2 Kickstarter was done where I let people,

2343
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,100
you know, like, send me PayPal things, and I would base, and I would, like, I wrote them

2344
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:10,600
down and like, okay, this person-

2345
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,280
We can't be fucking with all that shit for Redcon 4.

2346
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,960
You know, it honestly wasn't worth it.

2347
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,320
Like, I'm glad that, like, those people that wanted to buy the books got to, but, like,

2348
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,320
in terms of, like, how much did I actually make?

2349
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:27,840
Like, I mean, I only sold, like, maybe, like, ten more, and, like, it's like, you know,

2350
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,240
it was sort of, like, not worth the effort on my end.

2351
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,240
Like-

2352
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:35,760
I mean, you know, there's a couple factors here, but I think one of them is, Redcon is

2353
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,080
supposed to be kind of an exclusive thing.

2354
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,960
I don't even think it's necessarily a- like, let's just say if we kept giving out things

2355
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,160
a little beyond, that a little bit waters down, I think, other people's, like, it's

2356
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:50,360
a locked-in, you got this time to donate, you get the t-shirt, the pen, these are one-time

2357
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,360
things.

2358
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,360
Yeah.

2359
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,160
That's just one of the many factors, but, you know.

2360
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:58,200
Here's what I would say, I would say probably your best bit is either try and get a credit

2361
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,200
card if you can.

2362
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,200
It's not that hard.

2363
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,200
Or-

2364
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,200
I mean, it's not.

2365
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,160
Or if you're not willing to do that, just, like, get someone you know who does have a

2366
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,440
credit card to do it for you.

2367
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,640
I mean, I have a bank card that is, like, a credit card to use for most of my early life,

2368
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,720
but, you know, just like, it's a debit card for my bank.

2369
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:13,720
That works.

2370
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,880
I mean, can you get prepaid debit cards from, like, the grocery store and just load money

2371
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,880
on it?

2372
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,880
Yes.

2373
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:19,880
The answer is yes.

2374
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:20,880
And you can do that sort of thing, too.

2375
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,720
Look, there's a will, there's a way, people.

2376
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:26,560
Like, if you think, if you sit down and think critically, look, I understand, you're not

2377
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,040
looking to do that much work to get this done, but I will tell you the solutions.

2378
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,480
These prepaid debit card things, like, those work.

2379
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,040
That would solve the answer, so you just go buy, I don't know, however much, if you want

2380
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:39,880
to get a $150 tier one, make sure you leave a little bit for shipping, get like, get like

2381
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,960
a $200 one, and then whatever's left on, you just use on your groceries like normal, like,

2382
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,960
you can certainly do that.

2383
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,840
Buy coffee, buy gas, whatever it is.

2384
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,120
Yeah, whatever you would normally buy, so no money will be wasted that way.

2385
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,120
That's a great idea.

2386
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,320
I forgot those were a thing.

2387
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,280
But there's, I think there's an even better solution, and it's simple, this requires

2388
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,280
almost no work.

2389
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,280
Becoming adult.

2390
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,280
And this is what I would do.

2391
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:01,720
I mean, I have credit cards, but like, you know, it's fairly simple, not impressive,

2392
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:05,320
like, if you don't, if you're like too young or whatever, just like, ask like your mom

2393
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,120
or dad, say like, look, mom, dad, here is the money in my bank account.

2394
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:11,480
I have the money right here.

2395
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:16,580
If you please donate to this, I will give you the money right now, and then you have

2396
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,480
lost nothing and are just helping me.

2397
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,600
And then you just put in your information for like the shipping and the names and all

2398
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,600
that stuff.

2399
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,600
But like, how, easy.

2400
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,240
But like, how embarrassing though, like, I'll bet a bunch of these kids, like, they

2401
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,360
probably like, they're sitting in the room, they're like staring at the Radcon for kicks,

2402
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,840
they're thinking about donating, their parents walk in like, oh shit, flip over to porn,

2403
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,840
like, sorry, mom.

2404
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
I was actually just jacking on.

2405
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,080
Mom, can I use your credit card?

2406
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:42,160
I need to buy a bunch of strangers posing in scantily clad outfits in a calendar.

2407
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,160
It's really important to me.

2408
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:47,360
They walk in, you know, you quickly close your incognito browser to the Radcon for kickstarter.

2409
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,680
They say, what were you looking at, son?

2410
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,760
You're like, nothing, can I borrow your credit card?

2411
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,520
They're like, what for son?

2412
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:55,400
I need to buy porn, I need to buy tons of porn, please.

2413
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,400
No, you were looking.

2414
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,760
As long as it's nothing degenerate or weird.

2415
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,440
You were listening to the PCP again, weren't you?

2416
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,360
They say they're kicking you down off the chair, they start kicking you in.

2417
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,440
And then out comes the belt.

2418
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,400
Not on my watch.

2419
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,080
Not that commie alt-right shit.

2420
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,160
No, no, Sarah, it's too much of that.

2421
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,760
Oh, you mean that infamous NazBull podcast?

2422
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:18,760
PCP.

2423
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,840
But listen, OK, I think we've provided two very workable solutions, either work with

2424
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,640
somebody who has a credit card, if you know, if you have a friend or somebody, like, that's

2425
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:28,640
easy, just pay them back.

2426
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,640
I'm sure they'd be willing to.

2427
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,640
It's very simple.

2428
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:35,280
Or go buy one of these prepaid credit cards at like any grocery store and just put however

2429
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,800
much you need and a little extra, you know.

2430
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,800
Don't forget the shipping cost.

2431
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,840
It can be pricey if you're international and shit.

2432
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,840
So make sure you leave Runway.

2433
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,280
There you go.

2434
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,280
All right.

2435
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,280
We've given you the solution.

2436
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,280
Next one.

2437
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:49,280
Next one.

2438
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,280
Next one.

2439
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,280
Next one is our last one.

2440
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,280
OK, here we go.

2441
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,280
And oh, I'm very excited for this.

2442
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,280
This is every voicemail response ever.

2443
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,280
That's what it says.

2444
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,280
Let's give it a listen.

2445
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,280
Go.

2446
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,280
Hey, guys.

2447
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,280
Mass Effect, Malfil here.

2448
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:05,280
I just can't believe I got placed in the voice jail.

2449
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:11,280
I'm just going to, in the next five voicemails I send, I'm going to explain the long, sad

2450
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,280
story about why my voicemail wasn't good.

2451
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,280
And I'm going to be saying.

2452
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,280
It really requires.

2453
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,280
Please buy.

2454
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,280
Thank you.

2455
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,280
You know, short and sweet.

2456
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,280
Wait.

2457
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,280
What was that last bit?

2458
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,280
I don't know.

2459
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,280
OK, whatever.

2460
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,280
It was funny.

2461
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,280
Yeah, it was good.

2462
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,560
You really, you know, you owe us an explanation.

2463
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,280
We need to know the full backstory.

2464
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,280
Like, where were you?

2465
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,280
Like, how were you feeling at the time?

2466
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,280
Like, you know.

2467
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,280
Were you OK at home?

2468
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,280
What was going on in your life?

2469
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,280
You know.

2470
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,280
The story.

2471
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,280
Like, you send in a message and it's like, hey guys, I saw a girl and like, it's just

2472
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,280
cute.

2473
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,280
And I was like, how do we ask her out?

2474
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,760
And we go like, what a dumb question.

2475
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,760
Just do it, idiot.

2476
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:53,120
And then it's like, you write it like a month, months go by and you write and it's like, listen.

2477
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:58,120
I got that voice and I was like, listen, I was born under the Brooklyn Bridge.

2478
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,120
Under the Blood Moon.

2479
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:00,120
You don't understand.

2480
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,120
Under the Blood Moon.

2481
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,120
My existence was cursed from the start.

2482
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,120
It stopped my fault.

2483
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,120
Guys, you don't understand.

2484
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:10,120
I'm a Pisces and, you know, it's just sort of a bad week for me.

2485
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:13,120
Bro, like, sure, sure, our sun signs were aligned, but our moon signs, bro.

2486
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,120
Our moon signs were all fucked up.

2487
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,120
Opposite.

2488
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:17,120
Yeah.

2489
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,120
It's hey, man, it happens.

2490
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,120
It happens.

2491
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,120
I just learned the existence of moon signs.

2492
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,120
That's like a new frontier of astrology I just heard about.

2493
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:30,120
I was talking to Michelle, who retardedly likes, you know, astronomy to some degree.

2494
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,120
Oh, no.

2495
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,120
Astrology.

2496
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:35,120
How in high school you had like an astrology website as like your homepage?

2497
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,120
I do.

2498
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,120
Oh my God.

2499
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:38,120
Yes, I do remember that.

2500
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,120
You love.

2501
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,120
I check cancer every day.

2502
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,120
You loved it.

2503
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,120
Bro, I did no idea why you forgot about that.

2504
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:44,120
But I remember that it's true.

2505
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,120
That holy shit.

2506
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:49,120
Oh, I wonder if I could, I mean, it was like one of those shitty like, you know, 90s looking

2507
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:54,120
at website with like a repeated, tiled, terrible background of like a dolphin doing a flip.

2508
01:49:54,120 --> 01:50:00,120
Did you like read it and be like, hmm, it says I'll have a fortunate encounter today.

2509
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:02,120
Better keep my eye open for that.

2510
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:08,120
You know, I was a, I was a young man at the time, so I can't really remember how like

2511
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:09,120
seriously I took it.

2512
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:14,120
But I remember reading it and being like, like, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know,

2513
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:18,120
use these words and be, be into it for the day, whatever that meant.

2514
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,120
Pretty cool.

2515
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,120
Pretty cool.

2516
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,120
I had a lot of personality as soon as you get out of bed.

2517
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,120
I had a lot of personality.

2518
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:26,120
I had a lot of intelligence and personality.

2519
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:28,120
As you do, like every day I like check my horoscope.

2520
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:30,120
I crack open my fortune cookie.

2521
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:34,120
Like I scratch my Lotto tickets and then I fucking, and then I attack the day.

2522
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,120
Bro, but you're like cancer or Pisces or whatever.

2523
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:38,120
That's just your star sign, bro.

2524
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,120
The moon sign.

2525
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,120
It's all, this is the deep lore shit, the moon sign.

2526
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,120
The fuck is the moon sign?

2527
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,120
I don't even know what a moon sign is, but it's a thing.

2528
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,120
It's just like a deeper level astrology thing.

2529
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,120
I don't believe you.

2530
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,120
I'll tell you what it is.

2531
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:49,120
I'll tell you what it is.

2532
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:54,120
It's a, it's just your normal sign is what part of the sky the sun is in when you're

2533
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:58,120
born and the moon sign is just part of the sky the moon sun, the moon is in.

2534
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,120
Okay.

2535
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,120
And it depends on like the time of day.

2536
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,120
Whereas like the sun sign only changes in a few months.

2537
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,120
Yeah, it's like what time of day you were born.

2538
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,120
That's right.

2539
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,120
I know what side it is.

2540
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:07,120
It's up.

2541
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,120
The sky is always up.

2542
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,120
Yeah, it's always up.

2543
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,120
Well, except for the whole flat air thing, but...

2544
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,120
That's still up.

2545
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,120
We'll tackle that another time.

2546
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,120
Still up?

2547
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,120
The sun is under the, the disk?

2548
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,120
No, no, no, sorry.

2549
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,120
No, the orbit's around.

2550
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,120
It like goes around.

2551
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,120
The circle.

2552
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2553
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2554
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,120
They don't stare directly at the sun at all times.

2555
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,120
It's always up.

2556
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:31,120
The moon is a dark orb and the sun is a light orb and they kind of just kind of like twirl

2557
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,120
around each other.

2558
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,120
And it's pretty cool.

2559
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,120
It is, in fact, pretty cool.

2560
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,120
It is.

2561
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,120
All right.

2562
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:37,120
That's wrap it up right there.

2563
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,120
We're done with our voicemails.

2564
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,120
A speak pipe link down below.

2565
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,120
Leave us yours.

2566
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,120
That was a good crop.

2567
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,120
Short and sweet boys.

2568
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,120
Keep it up.

2569
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:46,120
Keep crying and telling us your sad story by your shitty voicemail.

2570
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:51,000
I can't wait to hear everyone's update on all the ones that I rejected this time for

2571
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
being too long.

2572
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,120
Oh, you know, somebody left like a long one shitting on Ben.

2573
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,120
Listen, buddy.

2574
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,120
Only problem with that, it was just too long.

2575
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,120
It was just too long.

2576
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:03,120
If you're one of these, like, you know, brevity is the soul of wit.

2577
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:06,120
Just call in, say, fuck Ben and then that'll be it.

2578
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:07,120
That's a play.

2579
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,120
That's a play.

2580
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:14,120
That is such an incredible, like, emotional content to, like, time wasted listening to

2581
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,120
the ratio.

2582
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,120
It's the ideal format.

2583
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,120
Exactly.

2584
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:19,120
Exactly right.

2585
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,120
So do that next time.

2586
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,120
And of course, go to patreon.com.

2587
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:29,840
Hey, $5 gives you, I think, 34 coming on 35 bonus episodes, or maybe I think those numbers

2588
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:30,840
are close anyway.

2589
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:37,080
A whole lot of fucking bonus episodes for $5 and $1 gets you into the PCP Discord.

2590
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,680
So do both of those.

2591
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:43,880
And perhaps more importantly right now, give whatever you can to the goddamn Radcon for

2592
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,080
Paradise Kickstarter.

2593
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,160
Great rewards.

2594
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,160
We're making incentives.

2595
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,160
We're doing it.

2596
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:53,720
It looks very likely we're going to get there, but now is the time where you can get your

2597
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,720
money's worth.

2598
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,720
Let's make more shit.

2599
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,000
90 second day, 90 percent.

2600
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
90 percent.

2601
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Feels good.

2602
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,360
We've got $2,000 pledges.

2603
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,600
Absolutely mad lads.

2604
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,600
Absolutely mad lads.

2605
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,560
But aren't we glad we didn't limit it to one?

2606
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:10,560
I know I am.

2607
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:11,560
Yeah, what the fuck?

2608
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:12,560
I don't know why.

2609
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,120
We did that last time because we were like so certain no one would do it.

2610
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,360
What if we would have gotten more than one last time?

2611
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,360
We just don't know.

2612
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,360
Maybe we would have.

2613
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,360
I don't know.

2614
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,360
We might have fucked up.

2615
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:25,800
I still think that maybe we should have a $500.

2616
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:26,800
I don't know.

2617
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,800
I don't know whether we can add that in now.

2618
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,760
I'm pretty sure we can, I don't think we can change existing rewards, but I think we

2619
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,760
can add new ones.

2620
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,520
Amen.

2621
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,520
I'd brainstorm it sometime.

2622
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,000
I feel like there might be one or two freaks out there who are not willing to go in for

2623
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,240
the full $1,000, but maybe they'd want something, maybe they'd think it was, we'll think of

2624
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,240
something.

2625
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,240
I don't know.

2626
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,240
They'd get to die first.

2627
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,240
They'd get to die first in the apocalypse.

2628
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,240
They'd get a smooch.

2629
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,960
They'd get a digital smooch through the screen.

2630
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:01,160
And you know, here's one little thing that I don't know if we talked about it last time,

2631
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:05,120
but one thing I really want to do, I can't give any promises right now, but I would love

2632
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:06,120
to arrange.

2633
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,120
This is kind of a hope thing.

2634
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,120
I can't promise it yet.

2635
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:12,920
I would love to have one of the days during Radcon, be like, on one of the days, we'll

2636
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:16,040
be at this park during this date, this time.

2637
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:20,720
So if you want to just hang out as part of Radcon, like Victor can come and film somebody,

2638
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:25,800
play volleyball or some shit, have a fucking picnic or something, I mean, that sounds something

2639
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,960
like that would be real fun, I think.

2640
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:28,960
The day comes.

2641
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,960
Hopefully we can make-

2642
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,960
Fucking snow.

2643
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:31,960
Everybody's miserable.

2644
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,960
It might.

2645
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,160
That's why we can't promise anything.

2646
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,360
Make no plans around this.

2647
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,920
We can't promise anything right now, but for the area.

2648
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:38,920
It would be incredible.

2649
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:41,920
I mean, it's definitely going to be pretty cold and chilly on the beach.

2650
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:42,920
It will not be temperate.

2651
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:43,920
I mean, it'll be March.

2652
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,920
It could be nice.

2653
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:45,920
It might be way better.

2654
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:51,400
The average temperatures in Virginia for March are between 60 and 70, most of the time.

2655
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,400
So that's good.

2656
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,400
All right.

2657
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,400
Global warming, doing its job, making the world a lot of ice.

2658
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,640
The water will be fucking cold, probably.

2659
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,640
Yes.

2660
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,640
Swimming will be a nightmare, but I will do it anyway.

2661
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:03,880
Which is why I want to film the splashing scenes.

2662
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,920
It's going to be terrible.

2663
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,480
We will just be miserable.

2664
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:12,400
I wonder if Victor's camera has slow motion, because that would be, like, you know-

2665
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,040
Oh, we'll have to talk to them.

2666
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,440
We got to make these plans.

2667
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,400
Oh, I want them real bad.

2668
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:21,000
Well, we're not going to even have to do that unless you guys get us to the OVA stretch,

2669
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
though.

2670
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
That's correct, everybody.

2671
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,280
So we have to hit max damage, 9, 9, 9, 9, we got to get there, or none of that comes

2672
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,280
to pass.

2673
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,520
So hey, just take that into consideration, folks, if you're thinking about donating.

2674
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,960
I know I've seen a few people being like, I'm giving like a hundred right now, but if

2675
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,120
I see that we're getting close to the thing and we need a little push, several people

2676
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:44,000
are there waiting to upgrade in the wings if we need it.

2677
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,120
So we'll see if we get there.

2678
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:47,120
Yeah.

2679
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,120
Very exciting.

2680
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,120
So push it to the limit.

2681
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,120
Duh-duh-duh.

2682
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:51,120
Please do, everybody.

2683
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,120
And I guess that's it.

2684
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,120
Leave more voicemails.

2685
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,120
Leave us more money.

2686
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:57,120
Follow us on Twitter, at TP Crasnators, there will be updates there.

2687
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,600
Even if you haven't given to the Kickstarter yet, I would highly recommend.

2688
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:04,200
You make a Kickstarter account and you like follow the page for any updates that we release

2689
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,200
or something.

2690
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:08,520
If you think maybe we'll release something later than I'm way into, you may want to help

2691
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,680
push us over if we make something really cool, because it's not 100% done yet.

2692
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:15,720
So hey, there's a high recommendation from me.

2693
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,480
We got a lot of ideas.

2694
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,720
So that's it.

2695
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,720
Very exciting, everybody.

2696
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,720
Radcon coming up.

2697
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:24,840
Sorry to keep you waiting for too long years, baby, but it's right up the pike, like two

2698
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,960
months, and it'll be upon us, like a month and a half.

2699
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,960
Absolutely incredible.

2700
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,960
All right.

2701
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:30,960
We'll see you next week, everybody.

2702
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:31,960
That's it.

2703
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:32,960
Another PCP episode.

2704
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,960
Another one in the can.

2705
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:34,960
Locked out.

2706
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:35,960
See ya, then.

2707
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:36,960
Bye.

2708
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,960
Bye.

2709
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:38,960
Peace out, baby.

2710
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:39,460
Slime.
