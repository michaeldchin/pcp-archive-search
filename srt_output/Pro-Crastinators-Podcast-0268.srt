1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey, Lodagos Kickstarter should be live right now.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We can talk about that a little bit later, but go check.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, and I also made the website, which is the most important thing.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, obviously I've seen your lecture. That's how I found out about you.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, okay. That doesn't surprise me.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good. Great.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, I guess I'm, thank you. Thank you.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So you've been like bouncing around in some Discord servers that I'm in here and there.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You gave me the heads up when some shit went down in the TGT community, or whatever, behind the scenes.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You have the inside scoop into all the goings on.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Would you maybe want to give just a brief summary of how you became TGT's envoy, liaison, ambassador, whatever?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How did you get where you are today?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, I was born in...

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, please.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll just skip that part.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Basically, I've been a fan of Tails Gets Told since about like 2012, which is basically when it got popular or when it was discovered.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So weird to think that it was on TV not for months.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Did people like find it on 4chan and that's how it got popular? Is that the story of it?

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, it was found by someone on something awful.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, that makes sense.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, and my friend was like a something awful goon, so he showed it to me and I just thought it was hilarious.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right. So you found it in 2012. How old were you? How old were you in 2012?

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was 21.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, so we're okay. So you're not that much younger than me, so that's fine.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, I'm 30 now.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, good. Few.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't have any more grooming allegations.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's a joke. That's a joke. I'm clean. I have zero.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, unfortunately, the average Tails Gets Told fan is a bit younger, unfortunately.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sad but true. Sad but true.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, I have to deal with all these zoomers and shit.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But anyway, so yeah, I've been following the series ever since then and through all the events that happened.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
One notable event was after his DVNAR account got hacked. That was a whole situation.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
When was that?

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was actually early in TGT's life compared to how long it's been going. It was also in 2012, but later in the year.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Right, right. Okay. Who hacked it again? I used to know this, but refresh me. What happened with the hack?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's really weird. It was like this weird Greek brony guy who wanted to get revenge on something awful.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So he like fished Laserbot's password with like a fake DVNAR site.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, yeah. You know what I mean?

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Makes sense, I guess. Okay, so anyway, continue.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, so Laserbot's password was Donkey Balls, which he used for every site.

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh no.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So yeah, the hacker got into all his shit and including his YouTube, which thankfully he didn't delete any of the videos.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So it's still up, but like nobody has access to it.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is that the channel that Micorat is posted on?

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, maybe we can talk about Micorat later. All right, continue.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, so, oh yeah, that was the whole thing. And so that was part of the reason why Laserbot had to get a new DVNAR account,

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
which also relates to like why I made the site, but I'll get to that later.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Basically, and the weird thing is like I told Laserbot like, oh, if you just email DVNAR, they'll like get you your account back.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But I guess he didn't.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So you were talking to him like even back in the day?

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, I wasn't talking to him personally. I was just leaving comments on his DVNAR page.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So I just left a comment that was like, you know, if you just like email DVNAR and tell them your account got hacked, they'll like get it back for you.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I guess either he like didn't understand or like he didn't trust anyone, he didn't trust anyone because he just got hacked.

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So he thought I might have been like trying to hack him again or something.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I guess that's a good time to mention that I have asked Laserbot a couple of times if he'd like to come on the show.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And he always kind of says like, yeah, I would, but I don't have a microphone or I'm just like, I don't feel like it or something.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He always is like, maybe, but I'm not actually going to do it. I can't do it for whatever reason.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He's like a little, I don't know. I found him a little bit hard to get.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know. How hard is it to get a microphone? I'd buy him one.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'd buy him one if that's what it's, but I don't think it's it. I think he's just like not very communicative.

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, it's also that and he's bad with like technology stuff.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I don't mean that as an insult or anything because like not everyone can be good at everything.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But like, I remember I was reading through the DMs that the hacker sent to people when he had laser.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, yeah, that's another thing. But I don't know if it's like out of order if I don't want to get into it right now.

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I eventually did get his DeviantArt account back like years later.

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What I just, I just pretended to be him and I emailed DeviantArt.

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I said, oh, someone hacked my account. Can I have it back? And they're like, sure, here's the password.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It wasn't too hard.

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So is that is that how you all right. So so anyway, let's get back on track.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How did you get involved with managing the the brand or whatever?

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, so the thing I mentioned about how he moved accounts, like he did that like a bunch of times and you even mentioned it in your lecture.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Like there is like some there is like he had a bunch. He had like a bunch of different DeviantArt accounts and yeah.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It made it used to be very difficult to like read the whole comic.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You had to go to multiple different accounts and websites to like find the parts because they weren't all in one place.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah. And I always saw people like commenting saying, oh, where can I read the rest of the comic?

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because either like they only knew about his first DeviantArt account and they thought it ended there or they only saw like some other stuff.

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And it's like, like, I guess I can't blame them because you have to do like a lot of research to like try to find all the parts.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And a lot of people aren't going to go through that like that much effort to try to find stuff.

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
True.

84
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So as and and like people have made other sites like it's something awful.

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Goon made tales gets trolled dot com a while ago, but they stopped updating it.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And now it's like taken over by like advertiser bots and shit.

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So I was just like, I'm tired of this shit.

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
People don't know where to read the comic.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm so like pissed off that nobody can read this masterpiece easily.

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So one day I was just like, fuck it, I'm going to make a new website so people can read it.

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And that's what I did basically.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And and when the website started out, it was just like a basic like HTML.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like you probably remember it.

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was like just like a white page with black text like you would find in like 1992 on the on the web.

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was just like links to all the pages and shit.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sure.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And actually the real hardcore, you know, tales gets trolled fans before that.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The main the main way to like read it was like people passed around like zip files of like the comics and shit, which is kind of cool in its own way.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's like it was like an underground like people swapping like zip files and shit.

100
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

101
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But that's a good old the good old days.

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, but that's what I that's what I based before TGT went mainstream man before it sold out.

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

104
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like I actually I on ironically sold out because I'm selling merchant shit.

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But yeah.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you make money off that?

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

108
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hmm.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

110
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I just put it into running the website and I give half of it to laser bot.

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Makes sense.

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I used that zip file.

114
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's also like a zip file and ZBZ file and shit.

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I just use those to like make the website and yeah, I made the website and I guess I wanted to talk to other people about it.

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I also made the discord and I guess I guess that's basically when it started.

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
When was that?

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
2018.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Did like.

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you like ask laser bot like hey do you want me to manage your social media and he was like yes or did you it sounds like you just kind of did it.

121
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well the the website was before the social media really.

122
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just I just made the website and I told laser bought it out.

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The way I got in contact with him like personally was through Facebook.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Actually when he had when he had the DeviantArt account he like posted on DeviantArt it was like oh everyone add me on Facebook.

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that's that's how most people got in contact.

127
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's actually how the hacker hacked is a DeviantArt because the hacker.

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is a totally unrelated tangent but I just so happened to be talking to um.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh Lillia the other day.

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

131
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I just I just I just like messaged him back because I had like not responded to his last message to me which was a while ago and he told me that he is making a game and I told him no way I'm making a video game too.

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And he was like yeah it's going to look like a Super Nintendo graphic style and I was like no way my game is going to look like a Super Nintendo graphic style.

133
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh Pog Pog.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to spoil it.

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to spoil it.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know if he would mind if I say it but I'm going to say his he told me that the name of the game he's making is Barakana.

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know what that means.

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have no idea what the significance of that is but that's a little that's a little bit of future.

140
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you see that's that's a I know you heard it here first.

141
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You heard it here first.

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You heard it here first Barakana by Nick Smith.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Anyway that's off topic.

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's get back to a PC a PCP exclusive a PCP exclusive scoop.

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What happened to what happened to platform master is I think he just kind of like he just dropped it.

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I think he like made it work.

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I mean this is like my my speculation.

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It seems like he made it exactly as he envisioned it and it worked but he just like didn't.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think he must have been like well it works but I don't really have any desire to like actually like polish it into a finished game.

153
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Right.

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I think maybe like his proof of concept was enough for him and then he lost interest after it was done.

155
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's what I suspect because it seemed like if a game was like made and working and there were demos of it and then it just disappeared and like the final release just never happened for no for no clear reason.

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh yeah tragic.

157
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh damn I should play the demos and because I don't think there was playable demos there were video demos though.

158
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There were like there were.

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah he posted videos of it like playing.

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well I'm showing off all the parallax scrolling in the background.

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I hope I hope he at least releases like something from it but I know he's a perfectionist so.

162
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No he didn't he didn't give me hardly any details about Barakana other than that it will have a SNES inspired visual style.

163
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And that that's its name and I he literally didn't tell me anything else about it.

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But that's that's all I got.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
OK.

166
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And so you made the oh yeah go on.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was just going to say I am checking out the website.

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's quite nice because it's like really like simple basic you know no bullshit everything's nice and easy to find.

169
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What's the URL.

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's told.org which is in my username on the server.

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let me see.

172
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh sure.

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I noticed.

174
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Whoa.

175
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Whoa the sprites.

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The little sparkles on the sides.

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Whoa.

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They look great.

179
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

180
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Actually.

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This looks so cool.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Actually.

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's awesome.

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Actually a Tails gets trolled fan came to me and just like hey I made a new layout for the website.

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Here you go.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And he just he just gave it to me like before it was like the HTML should I was talking about.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was like really simple.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I like tails in the top bottom left.

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was I was just going to say I really like the logo is just those iconic tails eyes.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Actually the if you refresh like the logo is random every time a bunch of fans like you

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
have like a contest for it right.

192
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And a bunch of people made logos a bunch of people made logos so I just put like every

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
time you go to the page like a random logo comes up.

195
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I see.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And then Ben is in the on the website as the TGT thanks on the credits page.

198
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Am I.

199
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah you are.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No.

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hold on.

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They're giving you thanks Ben.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Control F Ben.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
TGT thanks jazz flight Ben St. to win and newness.

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know if I oh I don't know if I did anything to deserve that but I'll take it.

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You brought attention to the series.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I did I I mean your lecture has like four four hundred thousand views.

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Do you do you think that like I made it like I brought any significant attention to it that

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
it didn't already have though.

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It did because I've seen people on in the community say oh I found out about tails get

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
stroked through like Ben St. lecture.

213
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's so fucking cool.

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So fucking rad.

216
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh my god.

217
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Beautiful.

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Though I do make a difference.

219
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's another thing I'll get to later but I agree with the other thing though is I agree

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,500
with Cybershell is that you shouldn't like watch the whole lecture if you haven't read

222
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
it because it spoils a lot.

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I agree.

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,400
It's sad but true because I know that watching the lecture I'm sure is not as interesting

226
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,000
after you've read the series and you already know it all but it's true.

227
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It spoils the whole thing.

228
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It spoils the whole thing and it's worth reading unspoiled.

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No it's the opposite.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You shouldn't read it.

231
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
You shouldn't watch it before you read it but after you read it it's really interesting

232
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
to see.

233
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,000
You think you act to see like people's reactions to it and stuff.

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah I guess.

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,600
I mean I mean I I would watch you know what I am totally the kind of person who would

236
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,000
watch a lecture about a thing I already know just to hear someone talk about it.

237
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Just to hear is the funny people go.

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Whoa.

239
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In the crowd.

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Whoa.

241
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Neutrals are cool actually like whoa.

242
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

243
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's why I enjoyed it personally.

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's fair.

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's fair.

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The big thing that bothers me though is that you never mentioned that Sonic died.

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's a huge yeah I really fucked up.

248
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,120
I really fucked that up and like I just skipped over that it just what I just forgot to write

249
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,120
it in my notes that there's like a whole big thing about how Sonic the Hedgehog dies

250
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,280
and it's like a huge thing and I just forgot to mention it so like I'm like an hour into

251
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,440
the thing and I'm like yeah so then the ghost of Sonic oh by the way he's dead oh yeah he

252
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
died a while ago.

253
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Whoops I forgot to mention I was like really important I think.

254
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Yeah.

255
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
I fucked it up.

256
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I fucked it up.

257
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
But what can you do.

258
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Well I didn't know about.

259
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Tails gets gay.

260
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
No he mentions.

261
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
I think I mentioned Tails gets.

262
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I never read it I guess.

263
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,120
But I mean it's one thing it's one thing quite easy to find.

264
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,120
It's one thing for me to say like oh yeah there's a part called Tails gets gay where he just

265
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,120
changes his art style and makes it all like goofy looking and sparkly and there's another

266
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
thing to actually like see it.

267
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
To see it with your own eyes.

268
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Yeah.

269
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
It's something to behold.

270
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,120
So okay so you got you made the website you got in contact with laser bot and I assume

271
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
you were just like hey let me manage all your social media and he was just like yes and

272
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,120
now you like run the the website and the Twitter account and probably like the Facebook group

273
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
and stuff like that.

274
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Oh I don't run the Facebook actually Facebook sucks and only boomers use it anymore.

275
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,120
And I mean yeah literally the only thing I do with it is occasionally message.

276
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Oh yeah like once every six months.

277
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Yeah and for those who are those for those who are wondering since you didn't mention

278
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,120
it that's why you brought him up because.

279
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Fuck.

280
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Yeah Nick.

281
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Nick.

282
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Nick also.

283
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Porky pig.

284
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Porky pig.

285
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Nick.

286
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Yeah yeah I get it.

287
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Rest in peace.

288
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
That's spoilers by the way.

289
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Anyway yeah he Ben brought him up because he also only uses Facebook.

290
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Yeah.

291
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Nick.

292
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Nick used to have a YouTube but like you know YouTube sucks so.

293
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,120
He told me that he told me that he like installed some kind of blocker on his computer that

294
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,120
blocks any website that's associated with Google.

295
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Including yeah including YouTube so he'll use Facebook because it's not Google affiliated

296
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
but he won't use YouTube because it's owned by Google.

297
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
That's awesome.

298
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
That's what he told me.

299
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
That's awesome.

300
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
That's awesome.

301
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
It's something.

302
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
It's something for sure.

303
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Yeah.

304
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,120
So alright so yeah you did the website and you run the account and you started like the

305
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Patreon for them right like you.

306
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
I remember I would see you tweeting.

307
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
No.

308
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,120
No you didn't but you were promoting it because you like you would see you tweet a bunch that's

309
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,120
like guys Tails gets trolled doesn't make enough money guys it's a travesty it only makes

310
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
$150 a month.

311
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Yeah it was $100 yeah.

312
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,120
You mentioned in the lecture they actually had a Patreon before.

313
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Yeah okay so that was before you were involved.

314
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Yes.

315
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,120
And but it was also when they were making Tails gets trolled polished which nobody liked.

316
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
That was a disaster.

317
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,620
Like I don't like to say anything bad about it but it was like the one time one of the

318
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,120
only times where I questioned like why I was a fan of Tails gets told reading that.

319
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,120
I mean yeah I didn't I didn't I was just kind of confused by it.

320
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I think a lot of people were why is can you can you explain to me why the Patreon.

321
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Okay so the Tails gets trolled Patreon is patreon.com slash Zegars underscore lab Z A Y G A R S underscore

322
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,120
L A B can you explain why that's its name.

323
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,120
I'll just I'll tell you what I think this isn't official or anything since I didn't make it

324
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,120
sure but I get the impression that Laserbot and his brother Ember Graham aka Zegar they've

325
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,120
they've always they've always wanted to like make projects together and that's also part

326
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,120
of the reason why they made like a bunch of different accounts like they made one account

327
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,120
like one was called upside down and they're like this is going to be our group where we

328
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,120
make projects and then they made another one that was like all this no this group is where

329
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,120
we're going to make the projects and then the last one they made was Zegars lab and

330
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,120
they're like no this is our new account this is where we're going to make the new projects

331
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,120
and that's that's like part of the reason why they moved accounts so much and they got Zegars lab

332
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:36,120
upside down was the account that he he commented on my lecture on an account on YouTube called

333
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:46,120
upside upside Annie down yeah yeah what's up with him I know that like Laserbot and his

334
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:53,120
brother who I guess is Zegar aka was Ember Graham yes Zegar Ember I know that like they

335
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,120
worked on Tales gets trolled together but like everyone still knows Laserbot as the Tales

336
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,120
gets trolled guy what is like what is like their deal like what is their like working

337
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,120
relationship like does one write and the other draw or do they both kind of just come up

338
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,120
together but then Laserbot like would actually finalize it like like what was Zegar's role

339
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,120
in everything I've always wondered about him yeah well they're they're broken up now they

340
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,120
had a falling out but I want to talk about that eventually yeah yeah but before that

341
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:35,120
for like a large majority of Tales get troll production from what I understand basically

342
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,120
at first Laserbot was just making the comic by himself and his he would show it to his

343
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,120
brother and his brother would like give him some ideas and like some suggestions for dialogue

344
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,120
like one example that they brought up is like during the fight where Sonic dies and like the

345
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,120
characters are fighting and Alex the emo troll like kicks or kicks I think it's emerald the

346
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,120
robot from Sonic Alex the emo troll kicks him and like he flies in the air and like

347
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,120
kicks him and then in the next panel he says I just Peter Pan kick his ass apparently apparently

348
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,120
that was a suggestion from his brother so Zegar wouldn't like do anything he would just

349
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,120
kind of be like oh wouldn't it be cool if this happens yeah that's how it was at first

350
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,120
but then later in the comic they both like started co-writing it they both started doing

351
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,120
like half and half like a lot of the stuff with like the weed the weed party and stuff

352
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I think that was like Zegar oh yeah the weed party with um you mean with with Cheeto man

353
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:49,120
yes yeah the classic yeah um there was I mean there was the extended hiatus and then

354
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,120
there were many hiatuses yes yeah I'm talking about the one though where it came back like

355
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:02,120
well being drawn by new people yes that was because of me actually explain uh well for

356
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,120
uh this is like sort of off topic but did you read the um interview laser bot did with

357
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:15,120
know your meme no I have not I didn't know that he did an interview it was like the only

358
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,120
interviews he's ever done and that of course I had to get them in contact with each other

359
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,120
because like I said he's not really good with like technology or like getting in contact

360
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,120
with people and stuff sure but I mean like since we're doing the podcast now you can read

361
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,120
her but he I'm just gonna say he divulges like a lot of interesting information in it

362
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,120
but any I mean what are what are some highlights oh just basically what I mentioned about how

363
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,120
like him and his brother were involved and like what what they did what they did okay um

364
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,120
anyway um and like how and like how yeah yeah yeah go on and like how he came up with the

365
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,120
idea for tails gets told and stuff um okay I should read that I didn't even know that

366
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:10,120
was a that was out um so what were you asking I was I was just um I mean well I want to

367
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,120
know how you were involved in getting the you know tails gets told to come back because

368
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,120
it my understanding of the timeline is that you know it was going for a while and then

369
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,120
it sort of petered out and then it he did the um the what was it called the perfect tails

370
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,120
gets told perfect polished polished yeah he tried to bring it back it's like the polished

371
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,120
form and it nobody liked it and it didn't work and he stopped doing that after a while

372
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,120
yes and then and then then it kind of just went away and then it came back with like

373
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,120
new artists yeah that's right so how did how did that happen um basically and by the way

374
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I mentioned I have not read the like post uh hiatus stuff I've sort of been waiting for

375
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:02,120
to be finished I don't care about spoilers though but I don't know like any of the post

376
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:10,120
uh yeah the post skip uh plot points unfortunately I'm stupid well you can you can read like

377
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,120
we've already completed one chapter so you can read the chapter and then just wait for

378
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:22,120
the next chapter to finish I probably should okay but anyway tell me about what happened um so basically

379
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,120
um after he quit uh doing tails gets told I was still like I was still friends with him on facebook

380
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,120
and seeing what he was up to and stuff and he was post he was posting some concept art for a new series

381
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:42,120
he was working on called gods heroes gods heroes yeah which is basically he says is like a spiritual

382
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:52,120
successor to uh to um tails gets told can you I I'm sorry to interrupt but I want to know more about

383
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,120
gods heroes please um please tell me what what the deal with that was he actually posted on his dvn art to um

384
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,120
uh his ultimate I need to find some I need to find some art of it to show on screen I want to see it

385
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I'm going to his dvn art right now to look for it yes yes he because he posted all the concept art there

386
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:19,800
too uh I haven't even heard of this yeah he didn't he didn't talk about it much uh is it okay if like

387
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:29,240
I link it in the um sure yeah it should be in there uh it starts with the guy who says don't

388
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:37,320
mess with me I can't sleep I will fuck you up this this fucking batman looking guy yeah and all the

389
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,680
all the characters starting with him after that until the guy with the moon are all gods heroes

390
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:52,600
characters is this so the are these the titular gods heroes um I really don't know okay so this is

391
00:28:52,600 --> 00:29:00,840
like so this looks like this this basically looks like tails gets trolled as you know

392
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,680
like an action shonen kind of thing but with in the style of tails gets trolled but with

393
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,320
original characters yeah basically basically it's the still it's the classic the classic

394
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:25,400
laserbot trope of like a character just on in grass just just grass and sky yeah that's actually

395
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,640
that's actually one thing that I liked about tails gets trolled um that's one thing that

396
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,320
drew it drew me to it because it reminded me of like when I was like 10 years old uh I made like

397
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,400
shitty sprite comics and they were just like video game characters on a blue sky with like

398
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,720
green grass on a blank background made in Emma's paint sure sure and it reminded it reminded me of

399
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:57,000
those days the good old days oh it's got one of um wait no not save I want this this one this image

400
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:07,160
of a stereos coconut right here uh looking looking good making making a cameo lamal uh I mean was

401
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,000
was that well the guy who was on the dick show or am I thinking of something else yeah kind of

402
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,360
yeah like that that you got the right guy it's whatever I'm making a joke because it looks like

403
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:26,760
him um so very yeah I know I'm I'm really funny uh all right so God's did he tell you what was the

404
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,080
do you know anything about the plot of God's heroes or what the I don't know was it like a

405
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,400
was it like a christian thing I don't think so it was more like the okay than the neutral thing

406
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,480
because laser bot laser bot says he like grew up in a rich of religious household which made him

407
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,320
hate like christianity and shit I so that makes that fits very well with what I know about him so

408
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,440
okay but he uh he still uses it in his works as like a theme which I think is interesting um yeah

409
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:07,320
but oh shit what was I gonna say um what did you ask about again oh the plot the plot yeah yeah he

410
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,840
told me he told me uh he told me some aspects about the plot but he told me not to spoil it

411
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,400
so I might tell you what about what about can you tell like the premise or anything

412
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,520
or I mean if he told you not to say anything then I guess don't say anything um well I guess I'll

413
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:32,040
just say like a bait like uh like one aspect of it is that it takes place in the same universe

414
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:40,120
as tales gets trolled oh fascinating but that's and some characters might appear that were in

415
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:47,560
tales gets trolled but um I'm not gonna say who specifically that's very interesting okay so he

416
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:53,800
was so he was working on God's heroes during the like well he was away from tales gets trolled and

417
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:01,400
then and then what happened sorry I got the coronavirus not really I got vaccinated get

418
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:09,960
vaccinated everybody yeah I got Pfizer to vaccination gang are you Pfizer are you Moderna uh Pfizer yeah

419
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,920
Pfizer gang okay cool I got there uh I live in Arizona and they set up like a free vaccination

420
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,760
places where you can just drive up and get the back I we have I'll just this is totally up

421
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,120
if we're talking about vaccinations we have they set up the the Heinz convention center which is

422
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,280
like the place where like they do anime Boston it's the place where they do all the big like

423
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,720
nerd conventions in Boston the whole thing has been like stripped down the whole interior of it

424
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,640
like the vendors hall literally the room that they would have the vendors hall in at a convention

425
00:32:49,640 --> 00:33:00,840
has been cubicalized and turned into like a big like navy uh navy reserve run like clinic there's

426
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,040
like hundreds and hundreds of these people in the navy reserves like medically trained navy officers

427
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:14,440
like sitting in cubicles given given vaccines 24 hours a day seven days a week uh uh it was it

428
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,280
was beautiful honestly honestly it was a little moving I was a little bit like wow look what society

429
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,040
can accomplish when we all work together when we all when we all uh pitch in we put our heads

430
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,400
together we put our differences aside for the common good I was a little bit I was a little bit moved

431
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,960
by it yeah also it was cool to go to the Heinz convention center because I haven't been there

432
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,680
in a long time because I'm not a freaking nerd we go to say anime conventions anymore although

433
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:50,040
nobody does maybe I should be um I will you know what if they do it again they're probably not

434
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,480
going to do it this year but if they do if they do coronavirus again if they do coronavirus again

435
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,280
no if they do anime Boston I'll do my usual thing or I'll do my old thing that I used to do

436
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,960
of just go I won't buy a ticket I won't buy a ticket because I don't want to go to any panels

437
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,440
or anything because I'm not a loser but I'll go and I'll just like sneak past the security guards

438
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,480
and wander around in the halls and just look at people because that's the fun of going to a con

439
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,640
oh you know looking at weird weirdos you know you don't have to buy a ticket for that you know um

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,920
this is like really off topic but um the most amazing thing I ever saw is when I went to um

441
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:35,400
odacon in 2017 and I was I was basically doing the same thing I was walking around looking at stuff

442
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,600
and I saw this guy and it was like the most amazing sight I've ever seen in my life although I'm

443
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,720
showing you the picture right now oh the kick-a-stand flick

444
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:56,360
bass I odacon odacon's in Baltimore right yeah but the year I went it was in Washington

445
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,800
I see um I god when I I think I might have told the story before but when I was in college

446
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:13,320
I was in I think it was Baltimore and it was a decent I think it was Baltimore and um um

447
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:21,240
I just happened to be in the town where odacon was I wasn't there for odacon I just was visiting

448
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,360
the town and it happened to be the same weekend and I was with a bunch of friends and we went out

449
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:35,080
for brunch at this place that offered free mimosas with brunch and somehow I drank somehow I got

450
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:42,120
wasted on mimosas which is like I don't even know how I you do that I don't think I could do it today

451
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:49,960
if I tried but I got blasted on on brunch mimosas and then we and then we were walking home from

452
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,280
the restaurant or back to the place the friend I was staying with and we walked by the convention

453
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,920
center where odacon was happening and I was blacked out drawing I don't remember but I have just

454
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,800
like a flash of memory of the walk home of being in front of the odacon convention center and some

455
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:15,160
like some girls in like gothic lolita with parasols and like tiny top hats pinned to their their

456
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,440
their hair or whatever and I and I just remember puking like in for like on the sidewalk like with

457
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:29,080
them looking at me uh uh and then I don't remember anything after that um it's good breakfast mimosa

458
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:37,720
puking brunch mimosa you ever had a mimosa nope I don't think so it's it's not a it's not a strong

459
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,240
drink it's just it's like champagne and orange juice it's not a strong I remember it from the

460
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,920
Incredibles movie oh yeah you actually actually actually I may have had that before

461
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,160
it was it was good from what I remember yeah it's it's it's great it's delightful but it's pretty

462
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,000
I must have drank a lot it must have been a real lightweight back in the day I don't know

463
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,320
pretty interesting that you got blackout drunk in the morning well it was a celebration

464
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,680
for what it was it was on vacation it was a really nice brunch

465
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:23,160
really it was it was very it's good uh okay what we're what are we talking about I've got

466
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:30,120
god heroes god's heroes right god's heroes okay right so he was doing god's heroes and then he

467
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:36,360
was posting stuff about god's heroes and then what happened yeah so um I was like I thought

468
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,600
I thought like god's heroes looked good and I like sure I guess he didn't uh he didn't actually

469
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,200
start making it or at least he didn't post anything from like what he was making so I I just assumed

470
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,920
he was working on it so I was like hey uh god's heroes looks cool and all but like I think it would

471
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,920
be really cool like if tails gets cold came back but I I understand if you're like busy working on it

472
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,480
so I and actually a few years a few years before like laser bot like actually posted on

473
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,840
his dvn said you know I want to keep making tails gets trolled but it's too hard so if like

474
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,680
there are any like artists who want to help me draw it's too hard yeah sure yeah well he I mean

475
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,080
I laugh but I get it because like I'm sure it it's a comics take a long time comics take a lot

476
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,440
of time and effort he didn't literally he didn't literally say was too hard I'm paraphrasing but

477
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,000
yeah sure yeah but uh um he actually posted that a few years ago so I'm like you know that

478
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,280
idea you had about other artists like drawing it for you like how about uh how about I try to find

479
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,400
some artists like draw the script that he already written because the um the next part of the script

480
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:53,480
after uh coyote gets sucked into uh the thing which is the last part yeah which is yeah I don't

481
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,360
think I'm there yet no that's the last part you read apparently what do you mean no I remember

482
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,120
the last part I read was in the middle of the fight between coyote and demara yeah that that's it

483
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,240
oh demaro like wait what he gets demaro had demaro had like a portal on his head and like

484
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,400
coyote got sucked into it oh no yeah yeah you're right yeah you're right I remember now okay yeah

485
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,440
so yeah that's where it left off yeah so after that laser bot and and uh his brother actually wrote

486
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,760
a script that says what happens when he goes inside the portal but like he never drew a

487
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,920
comic for it so I was just like you know people could like draw out like that script and laser

488
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,080
bot and laser bot was just like sure go ahead so I posted on the website saying like I'm looking

489
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:49,000
like we're looking for artists to help draw like the um the next chapter of tales gets told and

490
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,040
like people offer to do it so that's when it started makes sense uh yeah so that's been going on for

491
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:06,600
what like a year now a year and a half a year and a half it's it started in uh November 2019

492
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,680
is is the story like getting close to being finished or like how how much left is there

493
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,120
uh laser bot and uh his brother said that they actually like have planned the whole story out

494
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,640
they just haven't and they've written like notes on it and shit they just haven't like scripted it out yet

495
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,480
so and like how much how much it has left to be made um this I'm just going off of what

496
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,840
Embergram said so take this with a grain of salt but he said that there are four arcs and we're

497
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,040
nearing the end of the first arc I don't know how after that first arc I don't know how I don't

498
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:56,120
know how I don't know how accurate that is but uh that's what he said okay meaning like arcs that

499
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:04,120
take place after coyote gets sucked into the portal no he said uh the one we're in right now about how

500
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:11,400
the um the characters are invading troll fortress which is like the overall the overall plot like

501
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,760
when silver you're telling me that Embergram told you that tails gets trolled is nearing the end of

502
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:27,160
its first of four arcs yeah well he he said it he said it he said it he said it in the discord

503
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,600
that's insane that's that's impossible I know that can't be true I know like that's why I said

504
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,280
take it with a grain of salt because I don't I don't really okay I don't I don't believe it myself

505
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,920
like I don't know I don't know if they actually have written that much I get it like like having

506
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,520
such a huge idea like oh what if I just did so much with it and then you actually have to work

507
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:56,520
and it's like oh maybe four is too many but like exactly the pages post post like hiatus the pages

508
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,520
have not been coming out very fast like they've been like a steady trickle yeah that's that's another

509
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:11,160
thing I got I'm trying to get him to uh like um do do it faster but uh he's busy with like

510
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,880
like they have like a really by he by he do you mean Embergram yeah well both of them but

511
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,400
especially him now since laser bot left uh they have a really they have a really weird

512
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,600
living situation where they move like every six months so that makes it hard as well okay I want

513
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,280
why why is it like that why are they why are they okay like all the like stuff that happens

514
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,800
behind the scenes like like you said they've had like a they've had like a falling out like they

515
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,080
don't work together anymore laser bot left the project and it always seems like laser bot like

516
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,560
he doesn't have a computer set up or he doesn't have internet access for a while or he doesn't have

517
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,240
of this or that or he's away like what what's the deal what's what's the deal with it like

518
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,320
the what's their living situation like that it's all it seems really chaotic I don't really have

519
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:07,640
any idea except that they're like they're like low I don't mean this as an insult but they're like

520
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:15,800
low lower like they don't have much money I mean that's I mean look at look at me look look who

521
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:24,920
you're talking to it's it's fine no judgments yeah uh okay that's that's okay well hmm all right

522
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,600
gotcha gotcha and I know they also had like a bunch of people living in their last house

523
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,400
like they had they had Embergram his wife their daughter their kid that they just had

524
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,840
they're married and have a he's married and has a kid yeah I didn't know that did they live

525
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,200
did Embergram and and laser bot live like in the same house yes and also and also

526
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:58,680
Micah was there too I think maybe Micah must be like the third friend that they made Micah

527
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:07,400
Rat with right oh Micah is their brother oh right okay there's three brothers yes and yeah

528
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,920
and the three of them the three of them together must have made Micah Rat which for anyone that

529
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:21,240
doesn't know is like an old like YouTube series yeah it's like a cartoon series about the three of

530
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:31,720
them as like animals just being wacky and being being weird uh I think I made a I think my YouTube

531
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,040
channel the Ben the Ben St. YouTube channel has a playlist of all the Micah Rat videos that I made

532
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:45,640
just because it would be convenient yeah yeah uh so if you can check that out if you're curious

533
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:56,040
Micah Rat is very dumb and I say that with love it's very like very silly and and random

534
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,320
yeah yeah so okay so the three okay so they all live in a house I I got you I got you so well

535
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:09,320
well they well they did now um laser bot moved in with Micah and their friends and they have their

536
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:15,480
own place and laser bot and his wife and their hit their two kids moved to a different place and

537
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:23,320
they're like looking wait laser bot is also married and has two kids no embergram's kids okay okay

538
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:30,520
and there was like a whole family situation like laser bot said he didn't want to talk about like

539
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,760
the falling out publicly but it just had to do like their like living situation basically

540
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,400
and I mean I messed up it was my next question was going to be so yeah laser bot left the project

541
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:50,280
can you explain like why that happens and like I I'm sure that like some details of it probably

542
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,160
like we don't need to get too deep into like family drama or whatever but if there is anything like

543
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,720
I don't know that he said about like why that happened or like what the problem was like is

544
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,880
there any chance that he'll get back on it or is it like what's the deal what's the deal with that

545
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:15,560
please explain yeah well the falling out is like one part of it the other part of it is that

546
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,840
basically he told me that well I mean you could probably tell just from being like a someone who

547
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:27,000
was like like following tale sketch told it seems like he didn't have like much interest in continuing

548
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,320
in the first place I mean it seems like he's been trying to start other things for a while

549
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:41,560
yes exactly yeah um like he's want he's wanted to move on for it for a while and like apparently

550
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,360
ember gan was like basically the one who convinced him to continue after the last hiatus

551
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:55,960
I mean on the one hand I get wanting to I get wanting to start other things but also I mean

552
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,240
tales gets trolled is what people know laser butt force so I think if I were ember I don't

553
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,880
kind of make sense in my head I don't really know these people but just my my gut feeling is like

554
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,520
embergram is like married and has kids probably he's being pragmatic being like

555
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,840
if anything is gonna like make money from this from this venture if anything is like gonna

556
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,120
be commercial or profitable from this whole comic thing we got going it's gonna be tales

557
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,680
gets trolled we should like we should make it we should work on it because this is our this is

558
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:37,800
our hit right yeah that's just my guess my wild speculation yeah um I talked to them but I don't

559
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,920
really like know them personally either yeah so I don't really know what's going on inside their

560
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,960
head all I can do is speculate but so okay so he all right so I guess they they had a falling

561
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,080
out or they had a fight or something and also just he laser butt's not super invested or he

562
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,800
wants to do other things and so he's not on the project anymore and ember is like so ember is

563
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:08,040
basically managing the like guest artists basically how is it working how is the project

564
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,360
working right now for for getting the rest of it made well actually the thing is I'm actually

565
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,920
managing the guest artists and I have been so what's so what's ember doing he has like the

566
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:29,640
script that him and laser bot wrote yes okay all right but you're in charge of like delegating

567
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:38,760
pages and stuff yeah basically mm-hmm how's that going um we're just waiting for a

568
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,040
embergram to provide more scripts to uh so we can make pages out of it

569
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,120
oh because he has like notes but he needs to actually like write out the full script yes

570
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,360
I see and he's going he's like has a lot of stuff going on with his uh like with his job

571
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,440
and like his new apartment that he's moving into like it had moles so he had to go to another

572
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:10,520
apartment and like all this other stuff yeah like the animals oh you cut off for a second

573
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:19,240
moles like the like the burrowing mammal no mold uh oh molds like the like the like it was infested

574
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,280
with digging moles they were digging a big tunnel underneath it okay that would be a lot that would

575
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:35,560
be a lot funnier I know it's disappointing um I see well I mean I guess that I don't know is there

576
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,480
I mean what if I just give you the floor to like say anything you want to say about

577
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,720
tales get strolled and like how it's been working on it or like the current state of it

578
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:55,640
yeah yeah what's up um well I do want to say that this is like probably going to sound like

579
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:02,040
really pathetic but I'm really I'm really proud that I made a difference in the world by making

580
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,280
the website for tales gets trolled and making it like more accessible to people I mean when you

581
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,400
when you tell me that people found tales gets trolled through my lecture I swell with pride

582
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,480
and feel like I made a difference in the world so I I get you I get you that makes me feel really

583
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:28,200
good it's a I mean it's a cool it's a great thing to I'm a big fan so you know yeah and the fact that

584
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:35,720
I made the website and I was partly responsible for the comment coming back and um yeah it's

585
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,720
it's something that I've been focusing uh a lot of my time on which is like one reason I was like

586
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,560
really like almost heartbroken that like laser bot left the project because like nobody knew like

587
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,040
what was actually going to happen like if it was going to continue continue or not and it's like

588
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,720
I spent so much like time and money like uh promoting tales gets trolled and stuff like

589
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,080
it would have it would have been like really sad if it ended without like finishing

590
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:10,040
like it like I know that cancelled yeah I know that like laser bots art it is sad because laser

591
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:17,480
bots art is such like a an integral part of the tales gets trolled comic um but I mean if

592
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,760
yeah so like when I heard that he left the project I was I thought that was a bummer and oh no the

593
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:33,080
comic's dead but I mean if if they had the story if he knew the story if he knew like where it's

594
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,880
going to go from here I even even though losing his art is a shame I still feel like uh you know

595
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,640
the project can be complete I still feel like we're getting the real tales gets trolled if it's

596
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:53,000
if it's what he intended to happen him and him and Zagar yeah so like I'm glad that it's continuing

597
00:51:53,720 --> 00:52:00,200
yeah I'm I feel kind of bad like I haven't done a good job like um oh what's the word uh

598
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,280
like describing or relaying like what is actually going to happen with the comic

599
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,000
because the tweet I made the tweet I made about um laser bot leaving got like it got like the most

600
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,200
like likes and retweets of any tweet I've ever ever made and then the fall and then the follow-up

601
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,000
tweet where it's big news and the follow-up tweet where I said uh actually guys it's not ending

602
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:32,120
that only got like like 50 retweets oh so you think that maybe some people think that it is over

603
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,160
yeah well I've actually seen that like unfortunate people are like oh you guys think tales gets

604
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:44,360
told is continuing while it's canceled so yeah well I mean what can you do people are gonna

605
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,160
people are gonna talk yeah especially people on 4chan apparently don't go on any other website

606
00:52:49,160 --> 00:53:00,760

626
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,440
I don't know get well how's your week been cc how's how are you doing how's your life

627
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:34,440
uh I've just been working pretty much yeah cringe cringe lame what about uh you give

628
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:42,920
oh uh the past few days I've been like catatonic I've been like nice like not moving and it sucks

629
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:50,760
are you still sick but a little bit I don't know it's like it's hard to say I'm the same as I was

630
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,600
like I'm not I actually vomiting or anything so it's just fine but it's not that great

631
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:03,960
that's how I felt like since the whole pandemic started I barely I barely go outside anymore

632
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,920
don't don't feel like doing anything well actually later today apparently I'm gonna go out for

633
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:21,720
father's day with my sister and my dad I have to call my dad later today yeah um I have been I have

634
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:30,520
become incredibly powerful actually why is that it's uh because I've started lifting again I've

635
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:37,240
been lifting I've been listening and it's a double-edged sword though because my lifts have been

636
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,240
going up my lifts have been shooting up in in one month I am back I was lifting for a while two

637
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:50,520
summers ago me and me and Kazi would lift weights in my basement two summers ago and this one I've

638
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,280
been lifting again for one month and I'm already stronger now than I was back then I'm already

639
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,960
up to like higher than I than I got on any of my lifts back in the day um but um part of the

640
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,520
reason why that's the case and I've made so rapid progress is because I've been eating a lot uh so

641
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:15,480
I'm also getting fat so I'm just going bare mode um and I don't like that but I really like seeing

642
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:21,640
numbers go up but the problem is you have to do both you can't I can't I have to make my my the

643
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,080
number on the scale go up at the same time that I make the number of plates on the bar go up it's

644
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:34,280
it's a faustian bargain you mean go down um I don't want number to go down number go down bad

645
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:41,560
number go down bad you don't want to lose weight I I do want to lose weight no I'm too fat I'm too

646
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,760
I'm too fat but I'm not strong enough it's such a it's such a conundrum no strong enough to bear

647
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:53,720
the burden of being fat that's right that's right uh it's just you lift you lift more when you're

648
00:57:53,720 --> 00:58:01,000
fat it's just kind of true so I mean I should I should I I should try that I'm fatter more now

649
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,560
than I've ever been in my life I've I've put on I've put on a bunch of weight recently only some

650
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:15,640
of which is muscle I'm sure so you know it's a double-edged sword there um yeah but but I don't

651
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,160
know feels good feels good to be strong feels good to be powerful so you know that's pretty cool

652
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,960
yeah I had yeah go on I was working out before the pandemic but then after I was just like well

653
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:38,360
time to stay inside and get fat there's well yeah same well I didn't know I I quit working out

654
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:44,440
before the pandemic started and then during the pandemic I still didn't do it I have no good reason

655
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,960
because I have my weight my weight set is in my basement I didn't have to leave my house to work

656
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,200
out I could have been doing it the whole time I just didn't because I'm an idiot yeah well it's

657
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:00,200
well you live you live in a house right yeah well that's easier for you because I still live in

658
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:07,000
an apartment unfortunately yeah I mean I have no excuse but they have they have gymson like my complex

659
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,320
so I don't have to walk very far um yeah was the basement you were in the same basement where the

660
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:21,640
lecture took place no that was the tails gets trolled lecture it's oh maybe you don't know the

661
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:29,240
radcon lore but do you know about radcon uh that doesn't mean that mean anything the radcon was

662
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,920
this was to be funny it's really funny I just assumed there was when all the pcp people got

663
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:43,080
together basically basically yes basically but we would rent a house for it um so that was in a

664
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:51,240
that was in a rented house that we all stayed in for a week in Sharon Massachusetts uh so that's

665
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:58,040
that's not a house that I actually lived in um so yeah different my current basement is a fucking

666
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:08,680
bare concrete exposed insulation spiders everywhere uh piles of garbage not garbage garbage but like

667
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,360
you know junk that's in storage that's not just kind of yeah that sounds like the house

668
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,880
Ember Graham was trying to move into I mean it's a night I look my house is pretty nice

669
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:26,120
which is why it's a shame that I have to move out of it in uh six weeks uh I better get house

670
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:33,320
hunting why is that well because my roommate a couple of my roommates have decided that they

671
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:39,160
want to move out and the rest of us can't afford the place without them so we've all got to move

672
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:47,240
out because we've all got to find a more affordable situation yeah yeah I've I've I've a roommate too

673
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:55,720
he's my dad nice but I actually I actually make more money than him and neither of us can

674
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:02,360
afford a place by ourselves so oh you make more money than your dad and neither of you can afford

675
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:12,360
a place yeah damn do you live somewhere expensive or do you just have shitty jobs uh shitty jobs

676
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,000
that's fine yeah well I mean it's not fine I mean it sucks but understood understood

677
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,680
yeah which is which is one one way I can relate to laser bot because we're both what it's one way

678
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:37,480
I can relate to laser bot because we're both poor sure yeah I I get it I mean yeah you know I laugh

679
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:45,720
I laugh but like yeah imagine imagine being like on the constantly moving not having like a steady

680
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,600
place to live not having just like a place to have your shit set up in your microphone and your

681
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:59,240
computer and stable internet yeah I must blow it was pretty hard it meant I can't I can't possibly

682
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:06,680
but if I could I'm sure it would be a big problem yeah that's lame well what one thing I I forgot to

683
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:12,040
mention is that they could uh they could probably talk on their phones on discord like they wouldn't

684
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:19,000
need a mic but that's I mean that's how that's how um we we did um the episode with Mallory

685
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,560
which everyone hated because they're all a bunch of weird fucking bootlickers who got offended by

686
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:32,920
shoplifting fuck you cowards is is is uh what's her pronoun or their pronoun what's her pronoun

687
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:41,720
yeah that's her yeah that's her um the purple hair sweet beans sweet beans new guy I just I just

688
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:48,520
didn't want to refer to them the wrong way no you got it she's a lady okay what's her

689
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:55,160
pronoun yeah that's funny but is she the one who she was the one who made like the the the furry

693
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:22,600
about it it's her her self-insert is laughing about PewDiePie they don't say PewDiePie but it's

694
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,560
she's laughing about PewDiePie getting robbed or Bray's house getting broken oh yeah I remember

695
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:32,040
that well actually that's and the new guy's like how'd you like it if someone broke into your house

696
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:39,080
and she's like you're a stupid jerk Baldi well she doesn't say that I'm paraphrasing um yeah that

697
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:45,080
that's actually kind of based not gonna lie it's kind of based I'm so glad you know what this is

698
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,760
this is not even joking this is like my litmus test if you're fucking if you if you get upset

699
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,320
if you get upset about the sweet beans comics if you get upset about Mallory's comics I

700
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,480
literally don't want to be your friend I literally just don't want to be your friend I

701
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,280
don't want to know you fuck you well this goes for you too viewers I'm not I'm not I'm not upset

702
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:12,280
by it but the the shoplifting one I mean I don't have a problem with stealing from corporations

703
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:19,560
it's just the comic was just kind of uh no I don't know I'll kill you what's wrong with the comic

704
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:26,920
uh I don't fight me I don't really remember I mean there's nothing there's literally nothing to

705
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,720
it it's just like a character it's literally just the character goes in and shoplifts and pens and

706
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,720
then walks out they're like like yeah generic understanding of like huh stealing I guess that's

707
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,000
bad and then if they don't think about I guess I don't think about it they might like just join

708
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,160
the crowd of like hey this comic sucks it I mean it's it's one this is this will be like the eighth

709
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:55,320
time I've gone in the same rate it's one thing to see that and think hmm I don't think shoplifting is

710
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:01,240
good but it's another thing entirely to read that comic and be like upset that someone drew it

711
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:09,400
upset that someone drew a character stealing got I will can you if you can believe it actually

712
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,240
some of the most some of the most popular works of cinema in in the pre in the last century have

713
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:23,800
involved theft have depicted scenes of theft murder sexual assault uh many many such illegal

714
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:30,120
activities have been depicted by character you know you get what I'm saying did you know the

715
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:36,840
crystal meth from Breaking Bad is not legal to eat dude it's logging into my logging into my

716
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:43,640
YouTube account to post angry comments on every screen on every upload of a scene from Breaking

717
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,520
Bad like I can't believe they made a show about making drugs don't they know that drugs are illegal

718
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:54,120
this is a bad influence that's literally doing that's literally what they're doing it's like that

719
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,960
a lot of people think like Walter is based though even though like he's a fucked up criminal

720
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:05,320
I know so this fucking this fucking little fucking orange cat that stole pens is also base I don't

721
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:14,200
get it oh yeah oh nothing literally nothing makes me angrier than fucking new guy discourse

722
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:23,000
yeah okay whatever it's totally off topic yeah we didn't really have a topic but I got something

723
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,360
you're right I got my please my lord of ghosts speaking of comics speaking of

724
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:37,160
incredible works of art like like tales gets trolled would you say that lord of ghosts is

725
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:43,880
better or worse than tales gets trolled oh it's far worse yeah agreed I can all agree probably

726
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:50,200
everything is worse than tales gets trolled it's just so it's so fun to watch that to read that

727
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:56,760
but yeah the lord of ghosts is my comic and I'm kick starting it right now I mentioned at the

728
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:02,920
beginning of the show link in the description link in the description I've got I got a video for it

729
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,320
it's uh everyone everyone put money in his Kickstarter yeah I've seen yeah that would be a

730
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:16,760
really good idea I've seen the I've seen the video it has not released as of right as of recording

731
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:22,360
the video is not public but I've seen it and I think it's funny so this has been from the past

732
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:31,240
predicting again a PCP scoop a PCP uh a exclusive scoop I predict that in the future you viewer

733
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:39,560
will watch a funny video and laugh uh and click the link in the description and be proven correct

734
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:47,400
it's a it's a comic about a ghost who is trying to become lord of that's not actually true

735
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,960
it's not actually what it's about but it's about this this guy who's a little blob of weirdo

736
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,800
he's stupid he's stupid and he goes around in this slime in his mud and there's killing

737
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,720
and there's blood as well dude how could you draw a comic where somebody kills another person

738
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:09,800
like that's such a bad influence on our society why didn't notably no but notably none of them

739
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:15,880
said that crime should be illegal did you see that Ben Shapiro tweet oh oh yeah yeah oh god none of

740
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:21,400
the what should what should you think should be banned hmm none of them said crime hmm says a lot

741
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:28,280
about our society yeah and the and the thing that he was uh tweeting or responding to they were

742
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:35,560
giving answers about like what food they would ban or something and it would I would ban crime personally

743
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:42,280
but crime from my restaurant all these these route these route co-left democrats won't ban crime

744
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:50,360
what the fuck is wrong this country that's true that's true sad yeah I mean lord of ghost is the

745
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,600
ultimate crime lord because his goal is basically to just build an army and then like attack another

746
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:02,440
city and he's the protagonist he's a good guy you like that you like that he wants to kill everyone

747
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:11,160
I can't believe this comic depicts an act of colonization lord of ghost wants to colonize

748
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:18,680
those those slime people and it's wrong yeah it's evil yeah anyway whatever what enough of this joke

749
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:24,600
enough uh or what kind of comic is it is it like a physical comic yeah it's it's a kick

750
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:30,760
started for the physical release of what I've done so far which is like a 90 something 100 pages

751
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:38,280
of what would be like a comic sized comic like smaller than a 4 bigger than a 5 I don't know

752
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:47,640
like the the normal size um speaking of which I've been I've been interested in looking into

753
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:56,120
a physical release of tails gets trolled oh all these I'll have to I mean I'll buy I'm gonna buy

754
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,680
a copy of lord of ghosts I will I'll buy an official release of tail gets trolled if that's

755
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:07,160
I'll have to I have to it would be really funny to have that on the show so yeah yeah yeah but the

756
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:13,960
thing is I have no idea how to make books or anything I it's not so difficult I I use this

757
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:20,440
well it might be a UK based um or maybe they have an American version as well but like it's

758
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,680
it's quite simple mix and what did you use mix and okay I used a company called cub lamb

759
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,840
yeah so mix and like that you go to them and you you say okay I want page thickness of this

760
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,720
grayscale full color um how many pages then you upload a pdf and it gives you like

761
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:44,520
like a little there's a little onsite on the website like you put the information in

762
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:51,400
even before the the images and stuff you see like how many pages and and like the size of it and

763
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,040
how many copies and then they tell you how much it's going to cost and it's really doesn't seem

764
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:03,480
that expensive the most expense I think for me is going to be the postage sending it out to people

765
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,560
once it's been made that's that's the hardest part because like

766
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,440
especially especially yeah especially for you because you live in a country that

767
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:22,600
sucks well I mean most most most of most of our audience is is in the US yeah predominantly so

768
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:28,680
like most stuff is going to have to go across the pond which is I have accounted for that in

769
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:34,360
in the the pricing there's a lot of like number crunching and and potentials because I don't know

770
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,240
exactly how many people are going to be from the US I have to like yeah figure it out make sure it's

771
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:45,800
not too expensive oh it's it's a whole thing but I've got it all set up and it's hopefully there's

772
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,680
going to be the lot of ghosts comic then there's the little ghost pin which I can take a picture of

773
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:56,920
because they exist now I got some samples and you showed me then there's like oh yeah I did show you

774
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:04,760
uh there's um there's a fucking stretch goals for guest art Ben of of whom will

775
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:11,960
potentially be drawing a little ghost story oh god that's right I agreed to do that oh no

776
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:23,880
I'm fucked now you just gotta hope you just gotta hope that uh the fucking thing doesn't

777
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:29,160
reach that goal um I'm gonna sabotage it yeah it's the only thing there's like a

778
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:35,240
then there's like a red man stretch goal like at the red man comic print which might be fun oh you

779
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:41,000
mean red you mean red noir no no no the little like little twitter comics in a little tiny square

780
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,920
book oh right right right right I forgot about those you haven't made one in a while I haven't I

781
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:55,320
should well I would but the final big stretch goal I have to mention to tease is the possibility of a

782
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:03,240
lot of ghosts plush which is it's really far up out there but I have like the plush company

783
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,360
making a sample of the thing and I might have a picture to show at some point I don't have it yet

784
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:15,960
but it's it's a whole big thing and I'm really excited I'm really excited to see how far I can

785
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,400
go with this because as soon as you have a sample you should post you should update the kick starter

786
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,960
with a with a picture of that as the stretch goal yeah definitely because I want to see that I want

787
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:33,400
to see that yeah so yeah it's uh for for tales comic news for tales gets told characters the only one

788
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:41,960
I would want to see a plush of is Rob the dragon born yeah yes yeah we're less dragonborn well the

789
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:48,280
other characters wouldn't work for obvious reasons I mean I mean I would like I think Alex is iconic

790
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,000
enough oh yeah he could he could have he could have a plush yeah I just meant the copyrighted

791
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,960
characters you wouldn't be sure yeah because you can get official plushes of them too if it works

792
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:05,560
so well because his head is always drawn like a thumb shape like it's so smooth like an egg

793
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:12,040
that's Rob is a strong choice I think I think Alex or the troll king would make pretty good plushes

794
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:17,160
yeah and Alex anyone else Alex could Alex could have his own back uh his cigarette

795
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,800
tomorrow yeah tomorrow and Alex could have his own cigarette which he smokes backwards

796
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,560
or removable you could remove it you can take it out yeah yeah and you could smoke it you could

797
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,760
smoke it yourself he it's an actual cigarette that you can just smoke it comes with one's real

798
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:41,560
cigarette yeah for fun yeah yeah uh yeah hell yeah did you ever so you can put it you can just get

799
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:46,440
a little hole in his mouth you can light a cigarette put it in his mouth and let it burn down until

800
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:53,400
it lights him on fire yeah okay that reminds me of a great idea Ben you know those under uh they

801
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:58,120
made like official undertale plushes and like if you destroy the plush there's like a heart inside

802
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:05,320
no no I never heard of that that was that's a pretty cool that's official that's official yeah

803
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:10,920
amazing it's like it's like supposed to represent how when you kill monsters like you get their soul

804
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:17,000
and shit sure yeah you would have to destroy the plush to get it oh that's great yeah it's so

805
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:25,000
that's pretty good yeah that's pretty on brand that's pretty good yeah um impressed did you

806
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,960
ever listen to those um the tales gets told album

807
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:36,600
no the the one uh j-flight made or just I haven't heard about it no you have it you

808
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,800
haven't oh my god you know what tell me tell me about it you didn't hear the tales gets told songs

809
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:49,960
I didn't please wait I saw that on the side there was a there was a bit about yeah um yeah there

810
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,760
jazz flight was a something awful goon and like he made a soundtrack for the first

811
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:05,160
10 chapters of the song of of the comic based yeah and the first is it is it good is it quality

812
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,720
yes it like they get stuck in my head all the time like the first one is like tales gets

813
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:17,320
trolled tales gets trolled yeah there it is and he he basically gets trolled the album

814
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:22,120
he basically he basically takes the dialogue from each chapter and like makes the song out of it

815
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:28,760
I see you have to I'm really surprised you haven't listened to that because that's like a famous

816
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:34,440
thing among the tales gets called community I I know I'm guess I'm a little surprised too

817
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:41,880
because I hadn't even heard about it fascinating I I do want to talk about I I know that I've

818
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:49,480
I know that I've come down with a pretty strong anti-dream stance famously oh my god but I did

819
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:55,560
I did have a dream and I want to talk about it I want to tell you about this funny dream oh

820
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:01,960
I thought you meant the fucking Minecraft guy no not the Minecraft guy fuck that guy I'm so I've

821
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,760

822
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,840
like I just see his logo and I just hate him instinctually the only thing I know about him is

823
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,320
that he keeps trending on Twitter I'm just like shut the fuck up I don't care about this shit it's

824
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:21,960
I've heard that like someone who works at Twitter is just a dream stan and they like promote his

825
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,600
bullshit not just in like in like the trending tab just because they like him not just dream it's

826
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:32,520
like a bunch of Minecraft fucking people like like yeah and their and their fans are all like 16 year

827
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:39,080
old dumb younger younger than that you gotta change your Twitter location to like yeah country

828
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:45,560
I did I changed it a little bit on my main account which is a chaff and hammer

829
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:52,280
um I changed it to like the country with like the least population I don't remember what it was called

830
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,920
but I just looked your your chaff and hammer yeah oh okay I know okay I've seen you I didn't know you

831
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:09,240
and the tails okay got it got it anyway yeah I I used to link the I used to link the accounts

832
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:15,640
to each other but I don't anymore but my my bio still says I'm the admin of tails gets full

833
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:23,080
but anyway um yeah I just looked on Wikipedia and said what is the least populated country and

834
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,800
then I put that as my put that as my trending and now nothing comes up so I'm pretty happy

835
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,320
about that all right that's all great but it's a distraction from the important thing which is

836
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:41,000
my cool dream that I had okay I'm gonna and I'm gonna tell you guys about I'm gonna tell you you

837
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:49,720
about my dream okay so in my dream I went to a big Christmas party at a hotel and the thing

838
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:56,520
was that I was meeting Joe Rogan because he was my uncle Joe wrote oh yeah Joe didn't you

839
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:03,640
talk about that on Twitter I know I might have mentioned it in my discord oh yeah you did yeah

840
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:11,720
um yes okay I'll I I like woke up after this dream was over in a in a sort of disturbed emotional

841
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:17,160
state and I was like I I'll forget the details I have to go write it down so I went and I wrote

842
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,000
down all these notes about everything I could remember about it so I'm looking at this big

843
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,040
paragraph I'm not going to read the whole thing I'm just going to give you the highlights

844
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:29,560
so as a hotel big Christmas party Joe Rogan is my uncle I'm meeting him for the first time

845
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:36,360
I'm really excited I'm like I'm going around the hotel I'm exploring the hotel and for some

846
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:44,440
reason I decide to call Joe Rogan on the phone and tell and pretend to be a little girl I pretend

847
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:51,960
to be like a little girl cousin and and be like I want to talk to grandpa uncle I'm a little girl

848
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:57,640
uncle Joe Rogan please unlock the basement so I can go down to the basement to talk to grandpa

849
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:05,000
and he knows that it's me impersonating this some little girl and he's like not impressed he thinks

850
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,680
that's really lame and he's like uh this is bad impression why are you doing this this is annoying

851
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:19,240
and I'm like uh no it's not Ben it's the little it's your little niece uh uh Samantha uh okay bye

852
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:25,960
uncle Joe and I hang up and I'm like oh fuck this is my first time meeting Joe Rogan and I just

853
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:33,400
made an idiot of myself he hates me oh fuck what have I done so uh uh um anyway so I'm walking

854
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,480
around and I'm getting and I get into an elevator and Joe with a bunch of people and Joe Rogan is

855
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:46,360
also there um and he asks if I need to get into the elevator and I do but I pretend that I don't

856
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,240
and so I'm just shuffled down the hallway as he like watches me leave down the hallway and I'm

857
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,800
like muttering to myself like oh you know you gotta you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes

858
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:02,200
just don't get into an elevator and I go down to the hotel lobby and someone offers me an alcoholic

859
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,920
coke zero and I know I shouldn't drink because I really want to make a good impression on Joe Rogan

860
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:12,280
yeah that sounds good but I take it I drink it anyway and I get a little buzz on my ha ha

861
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,680
now I'm gonna look like a fool in front okay I'm gonna skip a little bit I'm gonna skip a little

862
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:22,200
bit of this this is all you've like not wanting to fuck up your meeting with Joe Rogan I just

863
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,480
because he's got so much clout because he's got yes this is just ways all right late he's there was

864
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:33,720
like a big magic statue it was like a big like mobile art piece that like whatever there was

865
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:39,800
like a magical statue this is dumb this is boring I'm gonna skip that part the first part is is

866
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:47,400
relatable in a way not the doing the girl voice but like fucking like thinking for some strange

867
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:53,480
reason that what you're doing is like oh this this could work and then of course as soon as you do

868
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:58,520
it you wait you realize that's the stupidest thing I could have possibly done why did I do that I've

869
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:05,560
ruined it why did I why did I want to talk to grandpa so bad why did I need my uncle Joe Rogan's

870
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,640
permission to go into the basement in order to do so and why did I think that pretending to be

871
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:20,200
a small girl on the phone would convince him to make that possible for me um anyway who who's

872
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:27,320
your uh grandpa in this situation I don't know nobody in particular just a hypothetical grandpa

873
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:32,920
of this family that includes me and Joe Rogan I would have assumed it was another celebrity

874
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:39,480
no but okay so skip oh one thing I want to say is that I've been laughing this whole time but my

875
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:45,800
mic hasn't been picking it up okay just laughing on the inside yeah okay skipping through a bunch

876
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:53,080
of weird shit um I get to the end and um I finally even though I've already met Joe Rogan like in the

877
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:59,400
elevator it's like okay oh I'm meeting it's time for me to finally meet my famous uncle Joe Rogan

878
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,120
for the first time I hope I make a good impression even though he knows that I impersonated a small

879
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:09,480
child on the phone earlier but it's okay so he and some other uncle are walking up I mean he's like

880
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:18,280
hey oh Ben so yeah different uncle is it your uncle is he just a person who is an uncle no

881
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:24,120
another of my uncle so his brother or something so we really oh Joe Rogan it's great it's me

882
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,920
hey Ben it's me Joe Rogan your uncle oh it's great to meet you oh that's not what he sounds like

883
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:35,560
so we hug and I'm like wow uncle Joe Rogan I'm honored I'm honored to make your acquaintance sir

884
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:41,240
but he's like but he's like kind of sweating and he's like huge I know Joe Rogan is literally

885
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:47,640
five foot three everybody knows this well in the dream he's like he's really tall and he's like a bear

886
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,440
of a man and we hug but he's like a little off and he seems like a little bit like out of it and

887
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:57,320
distressed and he's telling the other uncle like uh it's fine it's fine it'll be fine you know I'll

888
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:03,560
just do a little drunk drive and you know it'll be fine it's gonna be fine and then and some other

889
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:09,160
guy some other family member we're in like a garage and some other guy is changing his tire or he's

890
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:16,440
packing up his trunk and Joe Rogan pulls out a huge silver gun and shoots that guy and his head

891
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:22,680
comes off and just plops onto the ground on on like behind where his car was and Joe like walks

892
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:27,480
over to him and soccer kicks the head and like kicks it like across the garage like kicks it

893
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:33,320
through a window or something and I'm like looking at this and I'm thinking like this is like a bit

894
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:39,080
right this is like some kind of joke like I'm being fucked with but I look at the ground and there's

895
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:46,200
like gore and blood from like the the gun decapitation and I'm like this is a bit this is a bit right

896
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,880
you're joshing me right now and so and so he Joe Rogan is like he's waving the gun around but he

897
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:57,000
looks back at me is like anyway where were we it's great to meet you Ben and I'm like uh yeah it's

898
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,200
great to meet you too uncle Joe um it's gonna be like drunk driving I'm just gonna do a little

899
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,520
drunk driving it'll be okay I'll be okay we do a little jump driving it's cuz we do a little jump

900
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:16,680
driving so that's that's where I woke up I woke up feeling like boy I gotta pretend like it's cool

901
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:22,200
that Joe Rogan just shot this guy's head off I gotta pretend like it's cool or else he might do the

902
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:27,320
same to me because he he seems disgruntled he seems he seems emotionally disturbed but he's got the

903
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:34,040
gun and he's huge he's huge Joe Rogan he's so powerful he's got so much so much clouds yes

904
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:41,880
exactly oh the cloud allows you to do so much you think he was gonna go to jail for shooting that

905
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:49,000
other uncle's head off no no he doesn't give a fuck that's he's got he's connected I just so

906
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,280
anyway that was my Joe Rogan is my uncle dream I just like how it's a unspecified other uncle

907
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:01,320
yeah well you know how in dreams there are people who you you don't know who they are they're just

908
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:07,080
there and you understand like they're like peripheral uh details you know what they are but

909
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:13,800
you could not possibly describe them yeah I was there I wanted to talk to some grandpa I impersonated

910
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:20,360
some cousin the guy he was with some uncle no one no one in particular you know yeah I have dreams

911
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,720
like that where I have family members but they look nothing like my family but I just they just

912
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:31,000
think they're my family in my head in the middle of talking to me he just pulls out this gun shoots

913
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,480
this guy's head off the head sits on the ground he walks over to it soccer kicks it out the window

914
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:41,720
it turns back to me still waving the gun like hey great to meet you oh boy it kind of it kind of

915
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,840
jealous that's a good dream it kind of reminds me of something from like a neil brain movie

916
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:52,120
it wasn't that good oh yeah

917
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:00,520
um anyway that was the most interesting thing that happened to me this week was a dream

918
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,080
it was all make believe that oh wait there is there is one other thing this week I decided okay

919
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:12,600
so you know like I said me and Oolulilia talked about our games how we're both making s and the

920
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,120
s looking video games a little bit uh so I've been working on that I've been programming I've

921
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:23,800
been coding I've been like tech tech tech like hacker typing like all the code into my game right

922
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:32,440
what engine what engine are you making it in a game maker studio two okay yeah game game maker

923
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:41,560
studio um so anyway I decided this week that like okay the game has a bunch of enemies and I'm not

924
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:48,360
going to say what the enemies are but the enemies are all a particular kind of thing so I had all

925
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,960
these dummy sprites that were the enemy and I was like you know since I have like a template

926
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:59,880
sort of made for the enemy sprites what if I just made you know like 30 or 40 slight variation like

927
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,680
I decided to do a lisa where every enemy in the game is like a little bit different looks a little

928
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:09,000
bit different has its own name just because I thought it would be cool because I love I love

929
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,360
that lisa did that I think that's so awesome so I decided to do that so this week I was like

930
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:19,800
I was grinding out all these unique sprites for each individual enemy and then I was like you know

931
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,360
I've got I've got like 30 done and I need like 40 something so I decided to make it like a

932
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,600
patron thing so I got in I got on patreon and I made an announcement I went into my server my

933
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,600
discord server and I made an announcement in the patron channel was like patrons if you want to design

934
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:40,520
an enemy as long as it more or less matches the template that I have like everyone can make one

935
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:47,640
and put it in the game and I think I've I've I've put like 10 in so far um people have made some

936
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:52,360
really funny ones I won't say what they are it would be spoilers but there's it's been it's been

937
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,520
funny and I've been it's kind of what I've been working on a lot this week is a lot of enemy

938
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:02,520
sprite stuff and adding those in and just having a just having a good old freaking time patreon.com

939
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:09,400
slash ben saint if you want to suggest an enemy design to be in phantom's revenge when that comes

940
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:18,040
out in the not too distant future um there's some funny there's some funny someone someone

941
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:24,040
suggested someone uh a brunswick reference there's now a brunswick references there there's an among

942
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:31,240
us there's an among us reference in there uh you know all the cool shit all the cool

943
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:38,120
shit that you have the two cool things that's right that's right uh yes speaking of speaking

944
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:46,200
of patreon uh apparently zegar aka embergram is gonna put me in charge of the tgt patreon soon so

945
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:52,920
might get some good rewards up there maybe oh you're not you're not already in charge of it no

946
01:29:53,720 --> 01:30:03,080
hmm it's it's uh yeah it doesn't it's it's under I mean just do they give rewards now I haven't

947
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:09,640
read through it in detail what's the deal with the patreon right now uh zegar was the one managing

948
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:15,880
that stuff uh before I came around as as we've said as we've said before like they're really bad with

949
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:24,200
like um promotion and shit so yeah he's like he's the one um he was the one doing that stuff before

950
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:29,640
I came along but he's still in charge of the patreon but he hasn't he hasn't had time to like do anything

951
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:37,000
the only rewards right now is that you get a title on the uh discord I mean okay fair enough

952
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,440
are you you're gonna add some more rewards you think yeah the one I'm thinking of right now is

953
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:48,600
the original like hd versions of the comic nobody nobody has them besides me and

954
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:56,040
embergram so that would be cool to upload them for them that's that's good that's a good that's a

955
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:05,400
perfectly reasonable thing that I could see people pledging for yeah hi res yeah um and maybe like

956
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:11,320

1064
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,360
how it works right yeah i was thinking of uh i was thinking of making one for myself just drawing

1065
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:45,640
like a a play button on a piece of paper and writing 1000 subscribers the the the paper plaque

1066
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:50,920
for one k yeah honestly the first they should be the first thousand is the hardest paper should be

1067
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:58,200
the one subscriber plaque yeah yeah true yeah you can you can upgrade to cardboard when you when you

1068
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:05,000
get the more budget uh yeah yeah when the production budget increases okay okay speaking of speaking of

1069
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:12,200
production okay oh sorry yeah go on no no it's fine what is it what's up uh just um you guys will have

1070
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:16,840
to like show me how to like make books and shit so i can make uh physical tales get shown

1071
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:24,280
i mean there there's not much to it um there's yeah the the sites they they they make it quite easy

1072
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:30,280
for you they at least this one does that i'm using you just you need to put it into a pdf format for

1073
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:37,400
this and it you upload it and it just puts all the pages there okay yeah kablam kablam has like

1074
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:41,320
you know you can you can choose like what page layout you want and they'll give you a template

1075
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:47,320
that's like okay lay it out so that like the image fits into this area you know this is the margin

1076
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:51,720
where you know you might get partially cut off so make sure there's nothing important there okay and

1077
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:57,240
it's like okay just arrange arrange your files into like tiff files or into like a pdf and then

1078
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:02,200
you submit them and then they'll they'll quote you a price based on like page count whether

1079
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:07,400
you want color or not and stuff like that yeah i think the the the most difficult part would be

1080
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:15,080
making because all the uh all the um uh pages are not the same size are they elf tails gets

1081
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:19,960
trolled some of them are bigger or longer oh yeah you're right you have to cut them up so that so

1082
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:27,960
that everything would fit on a page at a time yeah yeah yeah it's just can be a little tricky

1083
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:35,240
yeah we'll figure it out you guys can send me the websites later yeah next voicemail is called

1084
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:45,240

1088
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:18,040
it's i i i get i get it can i get it if you're nostalgic for like pre-pandemic old pcp whatever

1089
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:25,880
i get it but like can i uh i don't know can i life is changed can i inquire can i inquire about

1090
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:36,520
what the brad lecture entails well you can see it on our honestly the story i had the story all

1091
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:42,040
right i i know this is imagine explain imagine explaining the context of the brad lecture just

1092
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:49,880
someone who doesn't know where i got it so so the the channel right it got hacked one day because

1093
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:58,440
um uh nate made a made an oopsie and he downloaded a program and he has access to the to the to the

1094
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:05,480
channel his account his youtube channel and the pcp they all got hacked and what uh the content that

1095
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:14,360
was uploaded instead was this uh this live feed of like cryptocurrency brad cryptocurrency like

1096
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:21,800
ceo boy brad garling house with his his coin it was like live it was live streams yeah live

1097
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,840
streams about this cryptocurrency called ripple which is owned by no the cryptocurrency is xrp

1098
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:33,080
the company that owns this ripple and the ceo of ripple is this guy called brad garling house so so

1099
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:37,880
we were trying to get our channel back um it was really annoying and brad garling house was like a

1100
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:44,600
funny name for the villain uh he didn't do it himself it was obviously just some guy who found

1101
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:49,720
you know hacked you don't you don't know that you don't know that we you know we don't know that

1102
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:55,960
uh it could have been him personally but yeah then later we got the channel back we had radcon

1103
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:01,000
very soon after we got the channel back because we had been planning that we met up and we thought

1104
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:08,440
wouldn't it be fun to have brad garling house um appear at radcon he's the villain he's the guy

1105
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:14,760
he's like a character in our universe now so uh nate dressed up as brad garling house and he did

1106
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:20,440
a no nate wasn't there nate what nate was taking a shit nate nate missed it all night nate was

1107
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:25,480
mysteriously absent when brad garling house showed up that's true that's the party that's true and

1108
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:31,320
and brad garling house did a lecture uh in the style of the lectures we do at radcon like the one

1109
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:39,000
the tails gets full lecture kind kind is a little different is brad brad's new um yeah and yeah and

1110
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,440
that that's that was what that was so and so it's a yeah and the reason people are so nostalgic

1111
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:49,800
is because we took a really long time getting that out and so much is the the whole pandemic

1112
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:55,720
happened in the time in the time since yeah the whole pandemic happened and also we had like

1113
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:03,000
five members quit since then so like most of the people in that video are like not even around

1114
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,640
anymore or like maybe half i don't know that's that's that's another thing i wanted to ask you about uh

1115
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:13,560
before i found the tails gets trolled video the only member that i knew about was uh tricksy

1116
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:22,600
i hate you so um i yeah because because she did like anime shit i love anime obviously um

1117
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:32,200
and manga and gaming uh yeah uh so yeah go on so like what happened what what a what a

1118
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,640
i'm not i'm that's too that's too much to fucking get into yeah i'm not gonna ask you to get into it

1119
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:47,880
that's that yeah you watch all just all you have to do is just watch all like 280 episodes of the

1120
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:53,480
podcast and then you will know and then you will know yeah i so i i sort of have an idea of what

1121
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:59,160
happened so i'm not gonna ask you to get into it but it's pretty it's pretty sad yeah pretty sad

1122
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:06,200
what happened uh no it's good it's good that she's gone and i think it's funny and i think that her

1123
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:11,400
i think that what she's doing to her do her career is funny and it makes me smile so you know

1124
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:20,120
yeah so we can agree to disagree about that self sabotage lamel anyway okay the next voicemail

1125
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:24,440
oh which i haven't even uploaded because i'm stupid uh i'm uploading now the next voicemail

1127
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:40,280

1128
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:48,680
and munchie doesn't want to do internet stuff yeah that's about the only changes we've seen

1129
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:57,480
nate still is on good terms with the pcp yeah and jessey i don't know if you noticed but he

1130
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:05,160
wasn't super involved before radcon four yeah so that's true that status quo hasn't changed too much

1131
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:10,680
he had already been basically gone for like a year but then he just showed up for radcon because we

1132
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:17,640
asked him if he wanted to and he said sure um yeah this guy's right i really i wish more people had

1133
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:24,760
this guy's attitude yeah yeah things some things change yeah i don't want to i don't i don't want

1134
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:29,080
to be too hard on the people in the comic because i know that a lot of people are like uh i you know

1147
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:56,200
when margar was the thing of course yeah how could i later i i mean i think no no nate no watch is a

1148
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:01,800
meme now like when people post no nate no watch i mean is it a bit of a tired meme perhaps but

1149
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:08,040
they're not seriously complaining like nate's not here and it makes me upset it's a it's a it's a meme

1150
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:16,120
yeah so it doesn't bug me that much no but it is this is pretty tired it's a little i mean it's

01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:36,200
inviting her on for one episode she's kind of a big inspiration for the whole group right

1154
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:42,120
kind of i know it's not funny how there's so much drama around specifically the brain lecture

1155
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:48,760
when a year ago jenny released a video about the brunny fandom and it's almost identical

1156
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:55,400
in format to the pcp university lectures i find it kind of funny if she was on maybe some other

1157
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:02,040
crew members could come on for a one-off sin who knows uh and a final question for you

1158
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:10,280
are there any other characters in media that are like brisker that you enjoy and uh do you

1159
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,880
like them for the same reasons that you like brisker anyway thanks for the cast love and kisses

1160
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:23,240
uh return to strong toton it will never die and peace what character did he say very brisker have

1161
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:30,040
you read homestuck cc nope it boo it just it just looks it just looks like a worse version of

1162
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:37,560
chales gets trolled you wait explain justify yourself i'm joking i i've never read it okay

1163
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:45,240
you fucking better be so that was a real comment he made i i don't i don't know some some people

1164
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:51,160
well some some people have actually some people have actually said that i can't understand i can't

1165
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:56,680
i can't understand the minds of people who haven't read home i'm like that that episode of regular

1166
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:01,000
show where they get too smart and they can't understand regular people anymore like that's

1167
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,880
me but it's with people who haven't read homestuck so like if someone says they haven't read it

1168
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:11,960
like i'll i'll believe any dumb shit they say because like of course they would um yeah no i i try i

1169
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:20,200
tried i tried reading it but uh i stopped reading it when he was in his room that's the first panel

1170
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:29,080
that's the first page yeah basically okay there that's fine that's that's fine um but optimistic

1171
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:34,840
of this guy to think that we could just get jenny nicholson to be on the show like i've talked to

1172
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:40,360
i've talked to her before but like it doesn't i don't think she just like oh she i mean she's

1173
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:45,400
a big name yeah she's a very big youtuber right now yeah she's famous she makes like a billion

1174
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:54,120

1175
01:55:54,120 --> 01:56:01,800

youtube uh pewdiepie we should get him on the show like that would be pretty good right like that would

1180
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:29,720
be a good idea no just a lot of people would watch that one he's cringe though just keep him away from

1181
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:37,320
bridges and we'll be fine um because he's gonna burn them because he's a troll who lives under a

1182
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:43,480
bridge he said he said he said a bad word when he was playing a game oh yeah i know the clip

1183
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:51,080
oh i don't i don't know it's it's the adpocalypse clip he he he said he he says one of the words of

1184
01:56:51,080 --> 01:57:03,240
death oh oh no okay i got you yeah i got you um to answer the question uh about vreska

1185
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:09,960
other characters there are some characters that that get that sort of character of like of like

1186
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:19,320
oh i i i know who that is yeah yeah the really fucked up um mean girl who secretly uh or is

1187
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:27,240
repressing like the desire to be nice um and it's really tragic there's not that many good of that

1188
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:34,040
but like the the general like trope uh like the the the the sort of stereotype of that character

1189
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:39,880
appears a lot uh pacifical northwest from gravity falls is kind of that and i like i like that when

1190
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:45,880
i see it i think i think um riska's riska is king i think i think i think i i think i know who

1191
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:50,920
you're talking about now is she's like one of the trolls right from uh not tales gets told from

1192
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:57,960
homestuck that's the thing about oh that's why because they both have trolls in them that's why

1193
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:04,360
you thought they were the same well i i i just laser laser but red homestuck and put trolls from

1194
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:09,880
homestuck like you put cart like you put carcat in just like saw that would be so good that would be

1195
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:17,720
so funny uh that would get me to pledge on patreon.com slash zegars underscore lab well uh i'll i'll

1196
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:23,560
tell them to put one i don't know but yes make tell them to read homestuck tell them to read the

1197
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:28,760
whole thing make them do it actually the only thing i know about only you the only thing i know

1198
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:36,680
about homestuck is when i met a homestuck cosplayer in 2012 oh well that's not special there's a million

1199
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:44,040
of those yeah especially especially back then uh which which good old days which which character

1200
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:53,960
is this let me send it is that uh that is that's feffery yes feffery feffery no no it's minna

1201
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:00,440
it's minna how can you tell because it's the short hair and she's got the stuff oh no i think you're

1202
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:07,160
right it is minna wow yeah yeah everybody yeah everybody's favorite character minna from a homestuck

1203
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:12,680
oh my god she's all right yeah i don't know anything about her she's like she's like a like a like a

1204
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:23,560
rare like shining beacon of something in axis yeah i guess i mean to me she she's mostly just

1205
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:32,600
emblematic of like briska's like dumb x6 nonsense i didn't i didn't like the briska minna thing i

1206
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:42,760
thought it was annoying uh yeah in the late stuff no oh god and then like the tooth like minna is

1207
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:49,480
involved with with carcats arc in x6 and and um and briska and they're both bad they both have

1208
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:56,680
no no i hate minna i hate minna all there but their fish puns are kind of cute that's all i

1209
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:03,080
think about it there was already another troll that did that and she was bad too and minna's just

1210
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:12,040
worse why i got oh i'm mad i got you guys i got you guys on a tangent no yeah yeah well we're

1211
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:19,080
second picture has as terezi and gamsy in it wait are you are wait who are you are you in these

1212
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:23,640
pictures yeah i'm the one on the left in the first picture and the one on the right in the second

1213
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:35,000
picture you're the white guy yeah nice okay cool uh gamsy's good terezi is good yeah terezi's

1214
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:42,040
gamsy's better than terezi until x6 x6 doesn't count x is in canon uh one one thing one thing

1215
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:49,880
one thing i found annoying is trying to read their dialogue oh yeah oh it's so hard at first

1216
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:55,960
like oh my god i can't imagine reading this but then there's she uses wait she you wait she uses

1217
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:03,880
threes for ease and and fours for a's and ones for eyes i don't i i can't oh it's so confusing

1218
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:08,440
like i can't figure it out what is it what does it mean some of them are more confusing than

1219
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:15,000
how do you read that i know i know you're being sarcastic but yeah you're a fucking dope you're

1220
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,440
a fucking dope in a fool and i hate you yeah no that's that's that's a that's a complaint that

1221
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:27,960
some people have and i i don't get it i i never found it hard i can i can i mean there are a few

1222
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:32,040
characters that have really obnoxious typing quirks but like they're all like minor characters

1223
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:37,000
that you just don't have a lot of dialogue yeah i get i get the ones i can i can read it it's just

1224
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:44,360
annoying you probably didn't get to the one character whose dialogue is all in white so you

1225
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:49,880
literally have to like highlight the text in the thing or you literally can't read it oh that that

1226
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:58,040
sounds cool it is cool unironically it is it's awesome homestuck rules i did i did like that

1227
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,840
yeah you know i think it's changed to a very very very light gray

1228
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:10,520
remember uh there was actually uh tales control did a homestuck ex esk thing

1229
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:15,640
in the early days there was a page that was no it didn't yeah there was a page that was actually

1230
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:27,000
animated that oh oh that's not anything oh i watched the new oh did you see uh the new uh

1231
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,280
episode of that time i was reincarnated as a slime it was very homestuck esk the way that it was

1232
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:38,520
animated yeah the way that the images moved yeah exactly you've got you've you've struck a nerve

1233
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:45,160
my friend you've made me testy you've made me testy yeah exactly with your bad homestuck takes

1234
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:53,640
i'm sorry i'm not a homestuck uh expert i'm very defensive i'm very defensive about my faves

1235
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:58,680
homestuck is my fate is my my fave i'll how long do you think it would i'll fight anyone

1236
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:09,960
how long does it take to read yeah um 20 minutes probably more maybe two weeks

1237
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:18,600
mm two two weeks if you really like buckle down and read it like a lot it's very long uh i'm very

1238
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:23,240
it really it gave me the Stockholm syndrome because i had to come to devote so much time

1239
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:28,840
to reading it that once i was done i was like well i better have liked it or else i just wasted

1240
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:33,320
all that time yeah that that's the trick yeah that's how i feel about tales gets trolled as well

1241
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:37,560
it's the fuck what is i mean tales gets trolled is not as long

1242
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:45,400
if you could probably read tales gets trolled in a couple days yeah at the most yeah um it's

1243
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:55,320
it's the sunk time fouls yes yes the sunk cost effect yeah 100 percent it's true it's true like

1244
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,480
if you finish reading anything the longer it is like the more i mean there's like

1245
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:06,600
there's like a there's like a funnel effect where like if you don't like something that much

1246
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:12,360
you just won't like the longer it is the less likely do you are to finish it but also there's

1247
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:17,960
the like if you do like it that much to spend that much time reading it then by the end you're

1248
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:23,160
going to like it even more because of the sunk cost effect you're like you've invested now you're

1249
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:29,000
emotionally invested yeah it's true it's true it's true for anything homestuck is just particularly

1250
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:36,200
long so it's especially true um anyway the the next voicemail is called tarp we already listened

1251
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:41,720
to an indecent proposal right i think so the the the jenny nickelson brony video i mean

1252
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:48,040
it's not it's not really similar to a lecture i mean it it's similar in that it's a person talking

1253
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:55,400
about a casual of like um i guess i like going going through the history of my little pony and

1254
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:01,560
jenny nickelson's video is about the brony fandom in general yeah trixie's lecture was i mean it was

1255
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:06,360
a little bit about that but it was more about it focused more on like the things she was specifically

1256
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:11,400
involved in which you know including like the pcp and the horseshoe crew and also like being a an

1257
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:18,360
editor for uh you know being the daily yeah the equestria daily like content editor oh yeah her

1258
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:24,920
position and stuff like her name used to be ditchy brony right yes okay back in the day

1259
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:30,360
yeah um she was digi brony mlp in fact her channel is still that's still her url i think

1260
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:35,640
yeah are you are you gonna are you gonna hate me for saying that i've never watched my little pony

1261
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:42,520
as well that's way no that's fine that doesn't that doesn't bother me okay i'm way less defensive

1262
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:48,440
in my mlp than about homestuck my little pony is just like a you need to to have been there at the

1263
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:55,320
time and it's still an okay show but like it's not like a as it's as big as brony dum was i wouldn't

1264
02:05:55,320 --> 02:06:01,320
i wouldn't like overblows the like the goodness of the show i wouldn't i wouldn't recommend that

1265
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:09,800
anyone like go back and watch mlp now no i don't i i have no interest whatsoever but i was there

1266
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:17,480
because you couldn't really escape it back then but yeah i didn't sure yeah i wasn't uh yeah but

1267
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:23,640
the next the next voicemail is called tarbuck transom finance god oh god it's a minute long

1268
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:28,920
three two one go fast talking crashmen and indestructible super god tarbuck transom here

1269
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,960
and i've been catching up on every pcp episode since january while i work on overdue furniture

1270
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:38,600
commissions instead of the digi archive that i'm in charge of and through all of those episodes

1271
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:43,880
one issue has burned brightest in my very keen mind the federal reserve does print money but that

1272
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:49,560
is not where most of the money actually comes from you fools it comes from double account banking

1273
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:54,440
uh which doubles the lent money supply by trading the debt as currency every time that it gets lent

1274
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:58,920
out but unlike anti-matter it doesn't annihilate when money is repaid and it also comes from

1275
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:04,200
fractional reserve banking depositing money and then loaning out a multiple of that amount

1276
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:09,480
such as 10 times because money is just numbers in a spreadsheet the fed technically controls

1277
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,640
the money supply because they set the multiplier bonus for fractional reserve banking but printing

1278
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:17,720
bills only accounts for 10 percent of the money generated every year and that's about to get a

1279
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:22,280
whole lot worse because in the middle of trump's administration they pass a loss to set the fraction

1280
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:27,480
to zero if you aren't clocking this it means that the banks can now print infinite nominee

1281
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:36,040
with no consequences ah that's stupid i gotta admit i like i'm sure this is in response to

1282
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:43,000
something that we said about money that was dumb when we were talking about it at some point in

1283
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,840
the past but i'm like totally not in the headspace to think about fractional reserve banking i don't

1284
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:55,400
i don't have anything to say about this at fractional reverse banking where they give me money

1285
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:03,000
that's like yes please that's like a really good idea i heard about reverse internships

1286
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,200
where instead of working there for free you actually pay them to work there

1287
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:12,600
i saw a post i saw i don't believe it i don't believe that that's a widespread thing but i

1288
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:18,200

1289
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:23,560
a post that claimed to be a real listing of like you pay us to work here but i don't know how much

1290
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:30,840
i i actually isn't that like school but like with work attached no yeah like for the for the

1291
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:40,440
owner it's basically slavery well so is capitalism so is capital yeah exactly when you get right down

1292
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:51,320
crack capitalism more like what no it's not like that at all it's it's totally wrong that's totally

1293
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:59,400
an act if you made a fool of yourself next voicemail is called uh taru buku turan somu

1294
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:05,800
three two one go the arches fast talking craftsman and left is jordan peterson the one and only

1295
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:10,040
tarot transom coming to you from what was supposed to be my dining room but is now my workshop

1296
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:14,680
positively buried in sawdust and rethinking my life i just had a pretty bad day making things

1297
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:18,120
for reasons not exclusive to the quarter inch splinter that i just pulled from underneath my

1298
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:26,520
fingernail and it was made all the harder because as i have said for thousands of years

1299
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:31,160
furniture is a scam you should just make it yourself it is so much cheaper and i find myself

1300
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:34,440
part of that industry taking advantage of people who don't know any better than to pay me to do

1301
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:38,360
something so fucking easy and i wonder if this is how i really want to support myself or if it was

1302
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:42,600
better off as just a hobby and something that i did to me needs a mind so they came up i'm a long

1303
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,040
time proponent of the ben saint lifestyle of just accept a lower standard of living so that you can

1304
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:51,080
do whatever it is that you want does anyone who can hear the sound of my very fuckable voice want

1305
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:55,160
to share a time when something prompted them to take a step back and reconsider their relationship

1306
02:09:55,160 --> 02:10:06,600
to their art or craft um what uh that's a lot that was a lot um did were they saying like building

1307
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:15,160
furniture is easy he's he said building furniture is easy and he doesn't understand why everyone

1308
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:20,120
doesn't just make their own for i mean i for me to make i mean i would have to go out and buy a

1309
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:27,080
bunch of like lumber and power tools in order to craft my own chairs to sit on so i'll just buy a

1310
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:31,800
chair i feel like you like you if you have a hobby that requires you need a bunch of tools

1311
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:37,400
then you don't have to put money into getting the tools that you already have i'm happy i'm happy

1312
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:44,040
that you're able to make a profit crafting furniture like good for you that's that's a win-win for

1313
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:48,920
everybody other people get furniture they don't have to make it themselves that's that's that's

1314
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:55,960
ethical uh mercantilism right there that's a human corporation people doing things and division of labor

1315
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:02,600
division of labor yes i would much rather spend the time not doing that and doing something else

1316
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:10,520
yeah was there a time that made me step back and reconsider my relationship with my art um

1317
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,960
every fucking day because i hate art and it sucks and it's a waste of time

1318
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:21,080
what does it mean to have a relationship with art do you mean does it mean like a skill

1319
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:28,680
specifically or just like the act of creating i think it could mean a lot of things uh i think

1320
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:37,320
i don't know like you draw what's your relationship with drawing did it ever change probably i

1321
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:47,320
i don't know i like it sometimes it's hard yeah true true um i don't know i feel like

1322
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:53,240
too stupid to answer such a question bedhead bernie made a really good tweet yesterday and

1323
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:56,920
i retweeted it and it went on to get out like a couple hundred likes and i thought it was really

1324
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:04,920
good it was um i'll read it it was uh scroll scroll scroll guy who chose to make their hobby a job

1325
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:13,560
this is worse than manual labor and i and i read that and i said so true king so true this really

1326
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:20,120
annoys me like when people like when youtubers talk about like oh how much work they put into their

1327
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:27,320
their stuff it's like yeah well that's fine and i guess i if i like your stuff i appreciate it

1328
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:32,120
but i don't feel bad for you and i never will because at the end of the day you could have just

1329
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:37,960
worked at target like anyone else you could just dig in holes you could have just had a regular job

1330
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:46,760
like like most people do and you chose this every every youtuber chose this right yeah it's it's

1331
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:52,760
funny because it's like every person who has a job that is like stressful sometimes they would like

1332
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:59,560
to go to a huge audience and get sympathy but only the youtubers get it only the big social media

1333
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:06,200
people are allowed the the audience to cry for them that's true it's like yeah yeah yeah

1334
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:13,960
every everybody everyone hates their job sometimes but you know if you it's you only hear about it

1335
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:22,840
if you have the kind of job where you have an audience and like any any any creative job or

1336
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:28,840
anything that you do that's just based on like people giving you money because they like your

1337
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:33,960
stuff i don't know like any any kind of like donation based or like patron based or like sales

1338
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:39,240
based like selling your own original content it's like if you're making a living doing that stuff

1339
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:47,480
you did you did it you know you you chose you chose to do this and it worked out for you

1340
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:56,360
and the worst that can happen is that it stops working out for you and you just have to go get

1341
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:03,960
a regular job like everybody else right so like it's really i very rarely feel sympathy

1342
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:12,200
for anyone but especially but especially content creators uh somebody in my discord

1343
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:17,560
i said i really like shawn i really like the youtuber shawn and someone said oh

1344
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:22,040
shawn made fun of linsey ellis shawn made fun of linsey ellis when she

1345
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:28,600
left twitter of her own volition okay i don't fucking care i don't fucking care i don't feel

1346
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:33,640
bad for that for that to matter i would have to feel bad for linsey ellis and i'll never feel

1347
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:39,240
bad for linsey ellis she makes so much money she's so famous i don't give a fuck that anyone made

1348
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:43,880
fun of her for any reason even even if it wasn't valid and probably if shawn made fun of her it

1349
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:51,000
probably was valid um so like good yeah i don't know i kind of i kind of like fuck content creators

1350
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:56,840
is what i'm saying they're all there's not a not a good one not a good one among them among the bunch

1351
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:04,120
the uh we're all criminals the movie bob linsey ellis thing was so like cringe embarrassed thing uh

1352
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:11,640
i don't think anyone i don't think anyone looked good in that situation yeah i don't know everyone

1353
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:20,360
everyone i've created some times all that stuff is just sort of like i feel like i i was standing

1354
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:27,240
in the doorway and i saw something i shouldn't have yes and i'm just sort of leave yeah yeah

1355
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:35,720
yeah like the quen the quentin thing yeah the quentin thing is like uh okay yeah yeah this

1356
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:41,800
is uncomfortable but what else can i even say about it it's just like oh that's an awkward

1357
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:49,880
interaction that occurred yeah oh well anyway we got to be here all day i keep going off on these

1358
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:58,120
tangents i'm sorry i'm wasting everyone's precious time the next voicemail you've got we've got a few

1359
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:08,760
to get through the next voicemail is called uh it's janez janez three two one go ben you talked about

1360
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:15,480
depth the first five thousand years by david graber a few times on the pcp really good so i was wondering

1361
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:21,240
well how do you remember such important information from a book where nowadays

1362
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:28,920
you hardly read but except on twitter i just really liked the parts about the lele tribe i just

1363
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:34,440
thought that was so interesting i don't know just some some i i couldn't tell you the whole book

1364
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:38,920
just certain parts of it were really really interesting and because i found them interesting

1365
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:44,680
i thought about them a lot and so they stuck in my memory there are boring parts too that i

1366
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:54,840
don't remember at all uh that's it that's my whole answer okay next one is called i don't

1367
02:16:55,480 --> 02:17:03,560
i don't understand transgender i think this should be good uh wait no this is sorry no

1368
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:10,200
actually this one is called this one is called maki's back sorry i post the mount of order

1369
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:17,400
this is maki's back three two one go hey it's me maki's back uh you might remember me like four

1370
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:22,440
years ago i did a cool skateboard grind and a voicemail and you guys liked it um if you know

1371
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:29,480
that's cool but uh i haven't i kind of stopped listening like 2018 thought i'd pop back over

1372
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:35,320
if you ask us to update you on what the fuck happened i'll kill you are you idiot i can't say

1373
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:40,520
i'm not surprised i just like your grind was not cool like huge lore events have happened that i

1374
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:46,040
should know about listen to the podcast this is a lot listen to the last 280 episodes and then you'll

1375
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:52,600
know listen to the last 280 episodes then you know you rube you fool what do you think we make content

1376
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:58,040
for if you can just make a voicemail be like oh just tell me what happened no shortcuts no spoilers

1377
02:17:58,040 --> 02:18:03,000
you gotta put the work in you gotta earn it you gotta pull we gotta pull a home you gotta put in

1378
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:10,520
all that time and emotional investment and get sunk cost fallacy on our asses do you think do you

1379
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:19,640
think it would take longer to read homestucker watch 250 episodes of the pcp oh 280 probably the

1380
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:28,360
pcp although you can speed it up on youtube you times to it let's see okay if we assume that

1381
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:34,840
that the the pcp episodes are on average two hours each which is maybe a little conservative

1382
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:45,000
but whatever then it would be about 540 hours and i think let's see i read i originally read

1383
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,560
homestuck in a in about a week or no i mean it was nine days and i read for about eight hours a day

1384
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:58,040
sounds like a job but now it's but it's longer now it's probably at least twice as long as it was

1385
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:03,640
yeah i think you would take longer to listen to all the pcp actually i think reading homestuck

1386
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:11,720
would probably only take maybe 200 hours tops to read all of maybe but i think listening to all

1387
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:19,000
the pcp would be like closer to 300 maybe you should make a pcp lecture about the pcp about

1388
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,560
what happened you're not suggested that you're not the first person to suggest it i don't think

1389
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:30,280
it's a crazy idea i don't think it's a crazy idea at all um but we'd have to get a whole

1390
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:38,040
audience of like non-pcp people that don't know what it is i'll join yeah because i i don't

1391
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:46,360
i don't really know either yeah all the guests all the guests that like don't even know who we are

1392
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:53,640
like we get to aria de mezzo and uh and uh and uh jim storm dancer and people that don't even like

1393
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:59,640
know what this show is that just we're on at one time and just get make them sit down and be like

1394
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:07,480
ran until you the whole history of our podcast well i'd be interested yeah it'd be funny yeah

1395
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:13,000
i think it'd be funny okay the next the next voicemail is called i don't understand transgender

1396
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:20,040
i think this should be good three two one go hi uh let me preface this by saying i don't want to

1397
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:24,840
offend anyone i just don't know any better what get a different answer depending on who i ask

1398
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:30,600
so yeah um why would you need to be a certain gender or sex in the first place that's something

1399
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:35,480
i don't really get because i feel like your actions and desires is what should shape your

1400
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:41,880
identity and others perception thereof yeah so like the concept of man and woman it's a bit like

1401
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:46,600
it's simplifying your identity instead of asking what you'd want to be in the first place

1402
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:52,680
so yeah um feel free to discuss i'm sorry this wasn't and i'm hoping this wasn't offensive

1403
02:20:52,680 --> 02:21:00,680
anything i i thanks i sort i sort of agree i sort of agree well in the sense that like okay

1404
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:08,920
it's really different takes on the up my i don't i don't really think that being a man or a woman

1405
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:16,040
means much of anything so i guess in that sense i agree but then like the caveat from that is that

1406
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:22,920
okay because it i don't think it means much there's like there's no there's no grounds for me to say

1407
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:28,360
that like someone else is or isn't and so if someone else says i am this i can't say no you're

1408
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:35,240
not because like yeah what does it mean to not be that nothing like it's it's it's it's difficult to

1409
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:41,880
explain because um it sounds logical to say it like that but i feel like

1410
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:54,760
when i realized i was trans it was it was like things that have i've felt about um you know

1411
02:21:54,760 --> 02:22:02,840
myself and what i am what i perceive myself as and what society perceives you know my gender

1412
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:10,440
to be like um it it affected me in ways that i wasn't aware of until i learned about

1413
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:20,600
what being trans was so like it feel it means nothing for like cis people because they feel

1414
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:26,120
okay but for trans people there's just this element of not feeling okay all the time it means

1415
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:32,840
it means basically nothing to me so yeah but that's just me yeah and once i realized that the

1416
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:38,120
it's like you know i was questioning i was like could this be could this be part of what i'm what

1417
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:46,120
happened you know it's part of my feelings i i looked and then i tried some stuff out i changed

1418
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:53,000
you know my pronouns i said call me she her and i i you know doing all this stuff and i realized that

1419
02:22:53,800 --> 02:23:02,760
i had been like blanket level depressed about that my entire life and acting a different way

1420
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:08,440
and doing certain different things in you know in the framework of like what society

1421
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:14,120
accepts and and thinks of as female because that's the only framework i have and you know

1422
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:19,480
as it's a you know gender is a social construct men have uh short hair women have long hair you

1423
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:26,520
know it's all made up it's all arbitrary but the things that were assigned to be like this is a male

1424
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:33,240
or a male gender thing to do i didn't like all of them and i wanted to do all of the other ones

1425
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:39,720
and i just didn't feel like i could i was like it wasn't i didn't feel like it was acceptable

1426
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:47,800
to just do all of those so it's it's really just it's really just realizing that it's okay to try

1427
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:55,320
all of those things and just to do all of those things that make you happy um would you say

1428
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:03,000
but you i mean i would say uh i don't mean to disagree but i mean i would i would say that

1429
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:09,960
like if you wanted to do all of those girl things you could do all the girl things but

1430
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:15,960
still call yourself a guy if you want it but if i wanted you or you could do none of the girl

1431
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:21,640
things and call yourself a girl and that would be fine too because i mean the part of it part of

1432
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:25,320
my take on it is literally it's literally just about what you call yourself like that's the

1433
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:29,880
question it's the thing about pronouns what your gender is it's literally just a question of what

1434
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:36,200
do you want to be called yeah and like it it's basically like a con there's like no content

1435
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:39,560
a little bit of that there's no descriptive con i don't know i don't i don't see it as being very

1436
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:49,480
descriptive it's it's um it's based on what society is and the one you grew up in if you know

1437
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:56,280
we grew up in a society where all of the things that made me feel comfortable um were things

1438
02:24:56,280 --> 02:25:03,000
that i was expected to do already then i don't know whether i would transition exactly i don't

1439
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:07,640
know whether i'd want something different but i can't know because that's like a hypothetical

1440
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:13,560
alternate reality so it's difficult to like explain it in a way that is perfectly understandable

1441
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:20,760
and i'm not like a psycho analyst person i mean i've just i've just like watched youtube videos

1442
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:25,800
that have tried to explain it better than i could i mean if it's at the end of the day

1443
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:34,760
it's literally just about like how do you feel and what do you want what do you prefer yeah so

1444
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:40,520
it's basically it's it's it's the way i like to think about it it's just like transitioning is not

1445
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:47,960
like um anything in particular it is just changing yeah it is transitioning from something you didn't

1446
02:25:47,960 --> 02:25:57,240
like and if and if it just so happens that um being perceived as male and and that like societal

1447
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:02,680
pressure to be masculine is something i really didn't like and i wanted to move away from then

1448
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:12,760
that's the the the decisions i make affect that um you know it's just i just want to feel okay i

1449
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:19,000
just want to feel better and it did work it like as soon as i was doing those things that you know

1450
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:25,640
i it was really confusing for a while like i tried the pronoun stuff out for joke no well it

1451
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:33,560
was i guess it was a joke as a prank bro it was just a joke to myself that's the way i uh justified

1452
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:40,600
it like who who would just do that lol um but like it actually made me feel a lot better and it was

1453
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:47,240
really weird and i couldn't wrap my head around why and uh yeah it's hard to explain seems seems

1454
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:53,080
seems pretty wacky to me but like that's cool yeah it's it's it's based entirely on my own

1455
02:26:53,080 --> 02:27:02,840
perception of what society uh is so if like if i have wacky ideas of of like um well yeah it's

1456
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:11,400
it's it's kind of in my head and that's but the yeah i don't know that's fine yeah sounds sounds

1457
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:19,960
sounds rational to me makes makes sense uh fuck what number what number were we on uh

1458
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:25,640
uh cc are you gonna are you gonna get pinkpilled you've you've been on the show now and about in

1459
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:32,440
about half of the people that that um associate with the pcp become trans so i would talk to

1460
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:38,120
your i would quarantine yourself for at least two weeks afterwards and talk to your doctor if you

1461
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:46,760
feel any sensations i think i think you can't explain i think it's too late for me oh yeah

1462
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:54,040
yeah i'm too old you toast yeah you're too old i knew a too old i knew a woman i knew a

1463
02:27:54,920 --> 02:28:01,160
a trans woman when i worked at astro camp in the town near the camp there was a bar

1464
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:09,000
that i went to like once or twice and the bartender there was this woman who was trans and who had

1465
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:13,640
i don't know who told i think one of my other like counselors knew this person and like told

1466
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:21,240
me about her and she had been like 50 she had been like like 40 plus and married and then was like

1467
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:29,560
you know what i'm a woman i'm gonna leave i'm gonna go become a bartender on some mountain town

1468
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:39,400
population of like 200 uh and become a bartender in this little bar and serve weird kids who teach

1469
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:47,160
at the space camp up up the hill sounds pretty cool and you know what and you know what she passed

1470
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:55,160
pretty good so you know that's that was neat one of one of the things that pops into my head or popped

1471
02:28:55,160 --> 02:29:00,760
into my head a lot was like i know but i'd be ugly if i was a girl that was that's a dumb idea i

1472
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:07,640
shouldn't even try yeah that's that's that's that's that's that's how i feel too yeah it's is it but

1473
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:15,000
is that how you feel if i if i was a girl i would be ugly yes okay it's it's i don't know whether

1474
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:24,840
it's like a classic case of like um dysphoria or not um i wouldn't i wouldn't judge me uh but i

1475
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:29,880
definitely felt that before and i've come to the realization that yeah i'm never gonna be like

1476
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:35,720
as attractive as if i had been born a woman um but it's not really about being attractive

1477
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:42,680
necessarily society does say women are valuable based on how attractive they are and as they age

1478
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:49,720
they become less valuable and they should be uh shunned and true and it's like it's like i don't

1479
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:56,360
no old bitties allowed and that's like that's you know whatever but like christmas christmas

1480
02:29:56,360 --> 02:30:02,280
cakes no christmas cakes please when i think of like the the the like alternative of like living

1481
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:08,600
life as a man i was like you know what anything is preferable to that i just i mean like like

1482
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:14,360
being like an ugly old woman that's cool i would i'd rather be that than an ugly old man

1483
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:20,680
i mean nobody or a slightly more attractive old man you know nobody's as hot as they want to be

1484
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:27,800
right no matter gender aside uh you know i uh i i wish i was i wish i was a sexier man

1485
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:32,200
unfortunately that's just never that's never gonna happen it's this never you know what it's

ideology bet is that trying to create a socialist world through unsocialist means always results

1560
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:46,840
in authoritarianism and a provision of socialism um i don't know how seriously to take this when it's

1561
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:54,360
a delivered as a donald trump voice coder i don't think that's the point of cycloneals i really don't

1562
02:39:55,160 --> 02:40:00,280
i don't know what that is so i'm good with spoilers how do you how do you make socialism

1563
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:09,400
without like stopping what's happening already last socially get socialism how do you non-violently

1564
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:16,840
get it last week give me and cheezy talked about it and we both agree that it's a little disappointing

1565
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:26,760
how like the the oh god the jubilite movement is like nominally like a socialist revolution

1566
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:34,040
but this story is not really about that at all and it kind of doesn't really have any bearing on the

1567
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:40,200
actual story it's just like an aesthetic thing in the end it's just like any other like revolution

1568
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:45,880
that has kind of its own sort of hierarchy associate and we both found that pretty disappointing

1569
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:52,920
the manifesto itself is not available to read we just hear about it being socialist yeah but in

1570
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:59,480
in practice all it really is is just like a militant uprising like its politics are sort of

1571
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:05,720
irrelevant it's kind of kind of no it's kind of a bummer um this is this is why i was like

1572
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:12,120
the other day i was reinvigorated to to do my re-listen and so we could do a cycloneals cast

1573
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:19,560
which i will do soon i swear uh sooner every day i don't know do you have any thoughts about that

1574
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:29,880
uh no i i i kind of want to replay re-read that as well cc cycloneals by the way is a

1575
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:35,720
is a newer thing that the homestuck guy made oh it is a visual it is a visual novel it's not

1576
02:41:35,720 --> 02:41:41,240
it's not a homestuck related okay except for a couple little Easter eggs yeah it's a new thing

1577
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:44,120
is it like being constantly released or is it like finished

1578
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:49,160
no it's finished it was released it was released episodically but it's it's finished now it's

1616
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:49,480
bad comment because obviously obviously this is just this is just sad at this point like you

02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:55,640
don't have to tell us why do you where we're doing it's a bit this is just a bit like the last like

1618
02:46:55,640 --> 02:47:01,640
hundred and fifty episodes of the pcb have just been a bit uh it's all it's all a build up to a

1619
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:10,120
punchline that may or may not ever come uh and if you can't see that then i honestly don't know

1620
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:14,040
what to tell you i honestly i don't think you know you then you just don't get it you just don't get

1621
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:20,840
it bro you just you just you just know we're just not on the same wavelength uh next voicemail is called

1622
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:31,560
a glimpse wait it's called a glimpse into the future signs and saints three two one go the year is 20

1623
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:39,000
xx weeks after the fire of megatucid ben now ascended would make his divinity known

1624
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:47,160
first ben appeared to gib offering her a great boon as a show of his power gib was enjoying life

1625
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:54,440
at this point Clarissa was now a series she could now afford to have not one but two hot plates in

1626
02:47:54,440 --> 02:48:03,480
her apartment but something was still missing ben's boon for gib was the gift of a pair of the biggest

1627
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:12,200
boobies the most voluptuous mommy melcos you're welcome to tom ben also thank you already immortal

1628
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:19,640
tom had little to gain from ben that is except the gift of healing tom could finally walk again

1629
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:28,680
ben in becoming a god gave up his sainthood but upon tom and gib he bestowed to each a new sainthood

1630
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:37,080
ben remembered also his trusted allies that is all the contributors to patreon.com slash ben saint

1631
02:48:37,720 --> 02:48:43,400
they too receive miracles and boos just like in real life this is the future before you

1632
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:50,120
even now the hands of fate move ever closer to this eventuality this the relief based future

1633
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:59,240
uh uh you know i like the idea that your patreon has like a tear or is it you literally get a

1634
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:05,000
miracle bestowed upon you miracles and i mean already you get to put a fucking enemy into my

1635
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:12,600
video game so like what greater boon could there even be true it's true i it's it's with it's

1636
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:20,680
entirely with with no bias at all that i say that i like this story about how i become a god

1637
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:26,280
and obtain ultimate power and then rule the world uh and crush my enemies and and imboon

1638
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:31,640
in my my allies it's it's it's pretty good it's it's it's it's it's a it's a good read yeah

1639
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:43,960
next one is called uh wait oh uh pcp bad comment award show number 266 justification

1640
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:50,600
i don't know if it needs any justification i was already on board but okay three two one go

1641
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:58,200
i'm gonna make this segment just to sort of like justify which comment i choose because um i get it

1642
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,840
because i don't know it might be necessary sometimes i'll just go ahead and do it for

1643
02:50:02,840 --> 02:50:09,240
each of them so you can skip these voicemails if the if it's obvious but uh so the reason

1644
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:17,480
i chose this one is because you know over the the recent pcp something very good and happy

1645
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:24,440
has been happening which is that uh gib has been you know transitioning and based on her twitter

1646
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:31,480
it seems to be going really well so you know i don't think the pcp is particularly sad right now

1647
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:37,800
like ben seems not in a particularly good mood but he never has been so that doesn't really matter

1648
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:42,440
gib is happy ben is the same as always so therefore it's a happy show now

1649
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:52,040
fuck you honestly i think that's a bad justification because i mean it's what what he meant is not oh

1650
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:59,080
the tone of the show is sad oh it's not that like oh this is it's it's that he thinks that like oh

1651
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:03,640
fewer people means that it's like desolate oh it's it's pathetic it's a shadow of its former self

1652
02:51:04,280 --> 02:51:09,240
so honestly this justification has made me think less of the initial appraisal so

1653
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:13,000
you really shot yourself in the foot on that one sir

1654
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:25,480
next voicemail is called mensa is for dweebs uh here we go yep there it is three two one go

02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:35,400
to be a member of mensa from the very first moment my eyes have been sparkling finally

1675
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:41,480
i arrived in a place where people share similar thoughts say similar puns have similar associations

1676
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:48,040
like i have naturally i also see the differences different characters at two dudes it's misspelled

1677
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:54,600
attitudes and views some of these some of these i embrace others i reject but this makes the world

02:53:54,600 --> 02:54:01,480
complete we cannot be different in the same way okay okay george george 44 that's pretty good i can

1681
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:24,520
looking for some external reinforcement i thought i would never have the time to attend programs

1682
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:30,200
as i had two young children out of curiosity i finally joined mensa and i have been a member for

1683
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:37,320
14 years now i found a great community interesting activities lots of love and eventually a husband

1686
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:53,160

that's so like wait a minute it's just missing like an indeed this reminds me um

1688
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:05,400

02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:12,840
on the episode of shreddit that i was in we were going over posts by people on the r slash

1696
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:49,480
we have the same attitudes towards the whole thing and this that's the vibe that i get from this

1697
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:56,360
from george honestly i think he sounds exactly like one of those guys who telling a story about

1698
02:55:56,360 --> 02:56:05,080
like i got a call from my mistress who understood i made a pun about i my wife called me and said honey

1699
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:10,120
don't forget to pick up the eggplant and i said uh eggplant like my dick and she didn't laugh at

1700
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:15,640
my dick joke but then my mistress called i called my mistress and said uh my wife didn't get my dick

1701
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:22,440
joke and she laughed at it and that's why i know that cheating is great and i'm so grateful for this

1702
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:33,880
community i don't know the cheating community the cheating um um whatever anyway whatever this

1703
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:37,240
looks like just a place to jerk your dick off just like every fucking thing on the internet

1704
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:49,560
fuck mensa yeah uh uh lame next voicemail is called um why isn't it wait there there we go

1705
02:56:49,560 --> 02:56:59,480
there we go okay next voicemail is called um trixie sexuality studies 401 advanced topics

1706
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:07,640
okay three two one go trixie sexuality is 100 based around filling a role and that's why

1707
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:16,680
she was uh straight before and is also i don't know i don't know i don't know what word to use

1708
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:22,840
she liked women before and likes guys straight so the reason is that before you can listen to all

1709
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:29,320
these dumb solo podcasts trixie did i listen to all of them and love them which i miss now but

1710
02:57:29,320 --> 02:57:34,520
whatever that's off track trixie would always say oh i want to be a dad now i want to be the

1711
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:43,480
internet's dad so that's why she was into may is because it was like you know being a paternal

1712
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:49,960
character because i guess it's like a dysphoria coping mechanism or something i don't know but

1713
02:57:49,960 --> 02:57:54,760
that if you don't know why you like is that that's the role she wanted to do and that seeped into

1714
02:57:54,760 --> 02:58:02,600
everything including romance but now now she's a fucking woman and um i know right friends um what

1715
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:09,160
does a woman do a woman is with a guy according to society so that's what trixie wants to do

1716
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:16,280
to fill in with the role to be the role of the woman who lets other people punch drunk angry

1717
02:58:17,240 --> 02:58:24,200
people punch her so that's why it happened maybe i don't know i mean maybe who knows

1718
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:30,760
it's one of those annoying things because it's like transitioning like being a woman doesn't mean

1719
02:58:30,760 --> 02:58:38,120
i have now a new set of values that i must i forcibly ascribe myself to like there are things

1720
02:58:38,120 --> 02:58:43,720
that i know like i know my voice is still sort of masculine i need to like if i want to appear as

1721
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:48,680
though i were female i would need to work on that and that would be like a conscious choice

1722
02:58:49,320 --> 02:58:55,560
to to like change that voice but i don't feel dysphoria about it so like my transition

1723
02:58:55,560 --> 02:59:01,560
doesn't need to include that necessarily yeah i feel fine with the voice i have but like if i

1724
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:07,640
wanted to be like quote unquote more feminine i would need to do something about it yeah but you

1725
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:11,880
don't it's not like part of transitioning for everyone it's it's always going to be like the

1726
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:19,240
individual's choice i i do i do i do think it's curious that Trixie liked women before her transition

1727
02:59:19,240 --> 02:59:25,720
and i guess likes men afterwards but i say curious with like complete neutrality like i just mean

1728
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:31,640
like huh that's curious that's interesting i mean yeah i mean it's not even that i i don't

1729
02:59:31,640 --> 02:59:37,800
know what i think about it because i i i don't know if i'm like hmm there's no like like weird i

1730
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:46,040
guess i don't think there's like a hard and first rule for like a or a term for like changing

1731
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:54,760
the gender preference or sexual preference like um it's it's not really i don't know i don't care

1732
02:59:55,320 --> 03:00:00,040
it's not really my place to like speculate on something like that i mean another person i was

1733
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:05,800
a little surprised to find that she has a boyfriend just because she had been so like i mean she

1734
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:11,080
used to when she talked about like i mean she always talked about thinking about girls

1735
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:18,120
whether it was like being one or being interested in them it seemed like that was well it seemed

1736
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:21,880
like she thought about that in both well i mean that's just what she said or that was the impression

1737
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:27,400
i got from what she used to say about it so i was just i was surprised but i mean like deep down

1738
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:35,400
like it had not occurred to her maybe that um being with a man would be fun or good

1739
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:42,040
right i just trying it out and she likes it so like cool at the end of the day i mean i don't

1740
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:49,640
know i don't know what's i don't know what's in her head um yeah who knows yeah next what you

1741
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:54,040
don't have a sexual preference from birth it'll all the change depending on stuff that happens

1742
03:00:54,040 --> 03:01:00,440
that's the thing i mean you can does anyone have a sexual preference at birth you can you can always

1743
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:05,720
change your mind you can always develop new preferences like you can i mean if you i don't

1744
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:13,800
know you can like not to say you can genuinely go for you could like theoretically you could like

1745
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:19,320
be gay and then like stop being gay if you decide you don't like man anymore or whatever or you or

1746
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:24,600
the other way or whatever you could be asexual at one point in your life and then later be like

1747
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:29,560
you know what i think i have developed an interest in sex and then you're not anymore and like

1748
03:01:29,560 --> 03:01:36,680
that's fine you can have it you can you can have be something and then just like change your you

1749
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:45,160
can develop a new preference if you want that i'm not a cop i can't stop you i can't stop you from

1750
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:55,400
doing that nobody can um it just is what it is man i don't know um next voicemail is what number

1751
03:01:55,400 --> 03:02:05,720
are we on we are close to the end finally okay uh this is called uh discord please accept my file

1752
03:02:05,720 --> 03:02:15,080
there it is max revive tarantino casts okay three two one go so i know nate doesn't want to be on the

1753
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:23,240
the pcp the actual pro crass tornadoes podcast i don't know but we got this fucking tarantino cast

1754
03:02:23,560 --> 03:02:29,160
over here that only ever got two episodes i think everybody liked it and now it's fucking dead

1755
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:37,800
why are you telling me i don't know nate and tom and gib are all still affiliated with the show

1756
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:46,520
in maybe maybe wishing upon a star jesse could be coerced into participating just for this one

1757
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:53,000
fucking thing you know i don't know i don't feel like jesse likes doing youtube i mean he's never

1758
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:59,560
like doing youtube content the prospect of coming back to do a podcast is like i could imagine

1759
03:02:59,560 --> 03:03:05,480
inherently disgusting going back going back to that bernie tweet talk about someone who is like

1760
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:11,480
oh i made my i made my hobby into a job and now oh this is worse than manual labor jesse is that

1761
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:17,560
like embodied nobody ever complained about having a cushy youtube job as hard as jesse did

1762
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:24,280
that's my fucking that's my thing i'm sorry if i'm coming off a little rude but that always rude

1763
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:29,800
that's i don't want to feel like i've maybe been a little hard on jesse at times i don't want to

1764
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:34,600
come off like i hate him or anything but boy that was one thing about him that would bug the heck out

1765
03:03:34,600 --> 03:03:43,720
of me at times i i suppose so i've i've always felt like it was he was playing it up but i

1766
03:03:43,720 --> 03:03:51,480
yeah he did do it all the time so i don't know yeah um uh i don't know thoughts on getting the

1767
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:58,760
tarantino cast back together gib um the tarantino cast we just watched the i mean it's a good excuse

1768
03:03:58,760 --> 03:04:05,240
to watch the movies because i haven't watched all of them um i think was it spearheaded by Trixie

1769
03:04:05,240 --> 03:04:14,520
and Nate i don't know maybe i think it was was it started at radcon no sure no i think we had an

1770
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:22,520
episode and then we decided to do a live one at radcon for i remember doing the logo before all that

1771
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:30,200
um i like that logo that was a good logo i don't even know what the logo was and i don't

1772
03:04:30,200 --> 03:04:34,040
know if i've seen it i've probably i've probably seen it on the channel somewhere

1773
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:42,520
if i just google it maybe it'll come up um no like the cast of the film tarantino cast

1774
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:49,480
now is never gonna come up okay next voicemail so that's so that's probably a no on reviving

1775
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:55,720
the tarantino cast i mean if you wanted to do a tarantino cast so tom like it wouldn't be everyone

1776
03:04:55,720 --> 03:05:01,080
