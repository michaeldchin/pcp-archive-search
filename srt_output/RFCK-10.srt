1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
3, 2, 1, DROP!

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You know what they say, a bitch on her knees is worth two in a hand basket in the black market.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Agreed.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to The Rowdyfuckers' live coverage.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll never meet a more hardcore set of jugglers and banksters and criminals.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Brought to you in the third dimension. We've just come from jugglers, Take Washington.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We were marching for our rights to exist and procreate as jugglers.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And to be members of the Dark Carnival.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
With decriminalized jugglers, we're not a fucking gang we're an art form.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ICP does not produce no violence. It changes your fucking brain to make you a better person.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Basically, it's how I feel.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's like those fat cats in Washington. They don't know about miracles.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They don't fucking get it.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They've never seen a miracle in their entire fucking life.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They've never listened to fucking Carnival, Carnage, or any of that shit.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All they fucking know is how to smoke cigars, use taxpayer money to emit greenhouse gases.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They don't know anything.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They're just shoveling government tax money into greenhouse gas into the furnace.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They don't know anything about fucking renewable energy.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They don't know anything about clown noises.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They don't know anything about getting fucking jiggied with Wii Sports, the greatest game ever fucking made.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They just don't know, but we're gonna show them.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
President Donald J. Trump, this is for you.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is gonna prove to you that jugglers are worthy of being a recognized citizen.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Think about what you're about to see, long and hard.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Get the fucking neurons fired.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're going on Fox News.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're going on Fox News.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Soon enough, you're gonna see this.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And if you see this on cable television, on Fox News, know that your fucking kids are not safe.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know why I'm looking at it. Your kids are not safe.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're gonna fight each other.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In both the online world and off.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna battle.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're gonna do battle here in the real world in my house.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Here in the ATL.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here in Washington DC, just off the streets, we went to a random house and fucking here we are to protect our rights.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It was just like, I was just there in full clown makeup with a picket sign.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like with just a picture of me in full clown makeup, in the crowd around me.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The picket sign was exactly identical to the scene before me.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it really made a powerful statement to those bad cats in Washington.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They don't believe their own eyes.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're gonna fucking run them for all their worth.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're gonna fucking slap them up. We're gonna fucking pat them down.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're gonna fucking turn them inside out.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We're gonna fucking, you know, we're gonna fucking need them.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're gonna like whisk them around.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're gonna fucking add some second hot sauce in there.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're gonna fucking drink them.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're gonna drink them up. We're gonna drink them down.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stupid clown hairs.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's what we want. We want the clown.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We want to be associated.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, let's just fucking play the game.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, let's play Wii Sports.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Before we can play Wii Sports, we have to make our own fucking Mi Sonas.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have to make our own for Sonas.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
With N.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've made many of Mi before.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have like a patented formula that produces incredible results.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Unlike Wii U, I have a ton of Mi's.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Pretty much all of them made at 3 o'clock in the morning.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Here, here.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm gonna go...

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've already created myself, but it's like a gay version of myself.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Nice.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually, you know what? Fuck it.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm just gonna use the gay version of myself.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You make yours.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, okay.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Alright.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've like whitewashed myself in my own memory.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why can't I see me?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you in control?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think so.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hold on.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Try now.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Try now.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Or here, just use mine.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What?

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fuck it.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why don't I use mine?

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I don't know.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It just fucking works for some reason.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, yeah, it does.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're in your menu.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wait, what the fuck?

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're picking your me.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Maybe this is why the other remote wasn't working.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, your light is on.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think you just can't use two emotes in the me thing.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know why.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just fucking use my controller.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My God.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is this making new yet?

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Alright, here we go.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here we go.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Start from scratch.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Check out this cool choker.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I got it.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was doing that first.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I was doing it with my black cop killer version.

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have the white purity version, which stands for fucking police dominance and fucking police

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
state.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Which one?

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think I use the...

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is so limited option.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's like a thousand.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This one's mine.

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's yours.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, I own it.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Remember me Tomo?

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Remember when that was real?

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What a good three days that was.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, me Tomo was pretty good for like a week there.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I had some good laughs.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I had some good times with me Tomo.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Made a couple of sweet tweets.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You probably came juggling down.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Juggling down.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Juggling down.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Juggling down.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Juggling down.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Honk.

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There, there's my hair.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh my God.

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That looks just like your hair.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I know, dude.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Unbelievable.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want like this, but I want it like to be brown.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, that comes later.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, okay.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That comes later.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Uh, these eyebrows.

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
These eyebrows are fucking making me thirsty.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Not like that.

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is it like that?

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, that is not at all.

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My hair looks so bad right now.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I like tried to like fluff it and it didn't work.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Look how Serena looks in your online persona though.

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's all that matters.

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's what I am.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, that's how I'm supposed to be.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All the, all the jobs make fun of me when I'm walking down the street and full of clown,

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
juggalo makeup.

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll make fun of me and fucking arrest me and whatnot.

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Every day when you're walking down the street and full of clown makeup.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They all make fun of me and fucking arrest me and say that I'm fucking illegal and I

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
can't be a juggalo anymore.

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But when I, when I fucking go on my online RuneScape persona and when I start role playing,

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
when I start fucking ERPing, then this is how I look like and this, this is the real

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
me.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is the true me.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, that's not right.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dude.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think it's a formula.

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I, yeah, but I forget it.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is it this?

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your eyes are for a part of this.

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You look like a fucking...

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A friend.

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Man, what was the one that I used to use?

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Actually, I have pictures on my Maitomo or on my Twitter from Maitomo.

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You know what?

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm going to look it up.

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Excellent.

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm going to look it up for maximum trees.

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fuck.

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Just hold on everyone.

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry to waste your time.

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No.

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No.

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We're not going to have this.

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not about wasting time.

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's about churning pure profit.

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I, I, I'm sorry.

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No.

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's about churning pure profit.

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I, I, I mean saving juggalos.

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Pay no attention to that last statement.

205
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh god.

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

207
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Here we go.

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We swear we're one of you.

209
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please continue to donate to our PayPal to ensure the future of the juggalo race.

210
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Please set up recurring payments to the Rowdyfuckers cop killers.

211
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A PayPal account.

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Untraceable.

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Untraceable.

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do not leave your real name.

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Uh, do not mention our real name.

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The private cop killers can only be donated to through Bitcoin.

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

218
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We, we, we have a partnership with Dogecoin actually.

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And only an installment.

220
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, only an install, you can only pay in Dogecoin, but you can only donate an installment's

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
worth one bit more.

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So that's like 18,000 Dogecoins or something.

223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Uh, okay.

224
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Here we go.

225
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Got to look at my profile.

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Got to go to media.

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're going to, you're going to be there awhile.

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, but it'll be worth it.

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're going to be there while kid.

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It'll be worth it.

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Trust me.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Fucking.

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Look at this.

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Look at this child.

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh shit.

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The screen went black, bro.

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Where?

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, uh.

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wow.

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's, it's tearing.

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let me just change the uh.

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The settings.

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Excellent.

244
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Still select in?

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

246
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Uh, screen saver done.

248
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Wait, we're going to have to change power settings.

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh my god.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is our best episode ever.

251
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Our set up right now is that we have like a webcam facing us, like a laptop up on top

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of the television.

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Like Vanity, I guess.

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then we have the, the TV and then Bin's 3DS is recording the screen of the fucking thing.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So both of these laptops have built in webcams.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We can't get even of them to work.

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We could not fucking figure out how to actually operate them.

258
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then the mic connects to the 3DS.

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So it's a fucked up weird saying, but you don't have to.

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I'm recording this through my 3DS.

261
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

262
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The one that was paid for by my kickstarter.

263
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
For the, for the, for the Pokemon sun.

265
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Dude, you send this video to all your kickstarter backers so they can get the full experience

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of like, like, like, like every dollar they're paid with is going directly to this.

267
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

268
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
See, it's, it's, it's a cascade.

269
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a cascading effect.

270
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's an S cascade.

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is the same width and like gravitas that cascaded has.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

273
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
At least in my opinion.

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I feel like I'm getting closer.

275
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm getting closer to the truth.

276
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Striking pure fucking gold.

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Which one of us would be Violin J and which one would be Shaggy Too Dope?

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Um, that's tough because, because...

279
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Keep in mind, Violin J is way skinnier nowadays.

280
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So it's like not fat.

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I mean...

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I mean like relatively.

283
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, who, which one's the brains of the operation and which one's the brawn?

284
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I would say Violin J is extremely intelligent.

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I would say that as well.

287
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He has so much wisdom.

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He talks about like being poor.

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Beating women.

291
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Smart.

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Those are the only two things.

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But trust me, there's a lot to say on that.

295
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Smart man.

296
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Good man.

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Good man.

298
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Where are you goddamn?

299
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I hate the image that's on screen right now.

300
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It doesn't look like it's not how I want to be.

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think it looks exactly like you.

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For better or for worse.

303
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's actually, it's actually closer than I'm comfortable with.

304
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's in the uncanny valley.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's unfortunate.

306
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey Jackie.

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Are we keeping you awake?

308
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

309
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
All right.

310
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I have options.

311
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then let us continue.

312
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Excellent.

313
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
They're here.

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They're here.

315
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I know it.

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know it.

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Our Juggalo names are like

318
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Carcat, Vantaz.

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And Therese Pyro.

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

321
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Original.

323
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh god.

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I know they're here.

325
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I know they're almost there.

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm almost to the promised land of Mitomo.

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Possibly.

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I might have missed them.

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is like the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life.

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

331
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This right here.

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to die.

333
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This right here.

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's going to get me.

335
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to give you the little Southern style right here.

336
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The old, the old.

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The old fucking workaround.

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The old shakeshack.

339
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm going to give you the clockwork orange he says.

340
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Taping a fucking baking clock to an orange.

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come on.

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come now.

343
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know, I know, I'm in the right spot.

344
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm in like the right era.

345
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The viewers demand fucking expertise in this area.

346
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, that's what I'm doing.

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Art takes time.

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh my god.

349
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm just looking at my old art and I'm just such a genius.

350
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm struck by my incredible skill and prowess.

351
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Right here.

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Uh.

353
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's that time that I ate an entire bottle's worth of multivitamins that had congealed

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
into a single puck.

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That was pretty good.

356
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's pretty good.

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That was a pretty good day.

358
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That sort of lines up.

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That lines up.

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's in character.

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Frankly, I think Ben St. has become flanderized lately.

363
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I agree.

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think he's been away from what he originally was.

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What was I originally?

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You know, unbelievable wisdom and fucking intelligence.

367
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

368
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Nowadays, the writers are only playing up the fucking gross aspects of them.

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

370
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, I have been flanderized.

371
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm complex, damn it.

372
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's time to get back to the...

373
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, I'll just nowadays start drama and make fun of brownies.

374
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's time to go back to the unbelievable fucking mirth and wisdom.

375
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I found it.

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh my god.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There we go.

378
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The exact same.

379
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I found myself.

380
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They might not even have that on this version.

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait, can you not do like pupil colors?

382
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, you can.

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I don't have that eye shape.

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh god, no.

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Phone, don't fuck me.

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't fuck.

387
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Do not fuck, please.

388
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, no, they do have that eye shape.

389
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Wait, wait, wait.

390
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do they?

391
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh yeah.

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Second row, third to third.

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, I need yours.

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

395
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bumble fuck.

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Bumble fuck.

397
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I put it over here.

398
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay, stupid.

399
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, I said something wrong because I'm stupid.

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm gonna keep wrapping anyway.

401
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, it was this one.

402
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, that.

403
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, it just looks wrong because the pupils.

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, brown.

405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can put them...

406
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, far apart, no.

407
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, no, it's like this.

408
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But then I put the glasses over it and it looks okay.

409
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Trust me.

410
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Pupils.

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Fucking pupil colors.

412
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where?

413
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

414
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It looks so light on the screen.

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Uh, whatever.

416
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We're gonna be zoomed so fucking out.

417
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We're gonna be, we're gonna fucking take that.

418
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We're gonna zoom it out.

419
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, you're right.

420
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There should be a Disneyland ride based off

421
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the Riforce Cop killers.

422
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, I wholeheartedly.

423
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What an Epcot, actually.

424
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Not even, not even Disney World in an Epcot.

425
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Uh...

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dead Kids the Future of Fucking Humanity.

427
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Dead kids are the future of humanity.

428
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Dead kids?

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, one day all kids will be dead and then our...

430
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, in the future all kids living currently will be dead.

431
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I'm hoping, I'm hoping for that day.

432
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm hoping for that day to come sooner rather than later.

433
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay, okay, I gotta move everything down

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because I have a big fucking forehead.

435
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh my god.

436
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now we're coming.

437
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is fucking, this is going harder than I could ever imagine.

438
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Uh, wait.

439
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, they don't have the nose that I wanted.

440
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When I brought my weed down to do Wii Sports,

441
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I never would have imagined that here standing before

442
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
a crowd of 35,000 people.

443
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Exactly.

444
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That we would ever have as broad of a reach as we do.

445
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But with such quality content such as this.

446
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay, I gotta bring...

447
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, they don't have the right nose.

448
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They do not have the nose that it's fucking Nintendo.

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, whatever.

450
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
All right, all right.

451
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
All right, all right, don't rush me.

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, you can rush me a little bit.

453
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is fucking bullshit, doesn't matter.

454
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

456
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No, this one.

457
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is the one.

458
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And like smaller, I guess.

459
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Uh, yeah, a little smaller.

460
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Perfect.

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's pretty good.

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't actually know if they're going to have

463
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
the kind of beard you want.

464
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Actually, for 100% they do not.

465
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No, they don't.

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why would they have such limited beard options?

467
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is fucking poor.

468
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This is fucking a poor.

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They're going to like have...

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're going to like...

471
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're fucked.

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There's nothing you can do.

473
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, um...

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Wait, wait, wait.

475
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Maybe I can kind of like...

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Maybe if I make it bigger, I can kind of...

477
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, that looks awful.

478
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This looks so bad.

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How is this ever acceptable?

480
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You know what?

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I kind of shave my beard.

482
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think I'm just going to go with like clean-shaven beard.

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay, okay.

484
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like pseudo clean-shaven beard.

485
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think...

486
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You're going for the classic bin.

487
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So you can get back to what bin thing was all about.

488
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

489
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The memes.

490
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The memes.

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think I'm going to call that done.

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

493
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Uh, favorite color is...

494
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Damn bro.

495
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Wait, no, no, no.

496
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going to be like...

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Damn bro.

498
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Uh, do we do white or black?

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know.

500
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Um, both are disgusting.

501
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Uh, I'm going to do black because I have the, um, the black, uh, uh, nunchuck.

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Fuck, yes.

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Dude, you're fine for the fucking black power.

504
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Dude, you're a black panther canonically within Wii Sports.

505
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Canonically.

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Who do you think's more conservative?

507
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Juggalos or Green Party?

508
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to go juggalos.

509
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

510
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm definitely going to go juggalos.

511
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because juggalos are about like...

512
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
They're, they're, they're like wholesome.

513
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like, like, like hashtag juggalos are always right.

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's my opinion on the subject.

515
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mine too.

516
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm glad you do.

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ben S, you know, for Anna and me.

518
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

519
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Uh...

520
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Mangle.

521
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Are you single in here, ready to mingle?

522
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Uh, my me is.

523
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Uh...

524
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

525
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Uh, no.

526
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh my, oh my god.

527
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't want to do that.

528
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That sounds stupid.

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Taking, taking a chance.

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Uh...

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Am I done?

532
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You put your me, you put your me, creator.

533
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh...

534
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
God, that was made by God for a bit.

535
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't quit.

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OK.

537
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Save and quit.

538
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
OK.

539
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Excellent.

540
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do we have here?

541
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh!

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What, what, what, what tightly peach just wandered into our fucking neck of the woods.

543
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Delicious.

544
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Alright, here you go.

545
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Scrum shits, frankly.

546
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let us, let us battle.

547
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All right, hold on, hold on, let me, let me just see mine again.

548
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,000
I have no idea, hold on. So bizarre. I'm gonna see if I can

549
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,360
figure out. Oh, look at him go. How can I figure out when this guy was made?

550
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Wait, I gotta make my guy shorter. My guy's gotta be shorter than you. How, how far am I in this?

551
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,760
Okay, tall ish. How, I want to know when I was fucking made so I can figure out why

552
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,040
I whitewashed myself and gave me fucking retard hair. Wait, give, wait, go into me and just make me like,

553
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
kind of short-ish. Why?

554
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,440
Because, because look at the screen right now, ladies and gentlemen. It's embarrassing, frankly.

555
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Here, I think he's correct for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,480
Law. I think, I think you are, I think you are shorter than me. Big man, what, in real life?

557
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,520
Well, a little more, a little more. I want the difference to be more pronounced.

558
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:45,160
No, come on. No, no. No, dawg. Little, little more. There you go. That's all right. Okay.

559
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,920
No, no. Okay, come on. Come on. Stop making fun. Yeah.

560
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,240
Stop poking shit. We gotta, we gotta get down to business. Look at him, he's very tiny again.

561
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,600
Oh my god, look at them. They're beautiful. All right, time to get down to fucking business.

562
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,040
Time to get what you fucking clicked on this fucking video for. The unbelievable fucking majesty.

563
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,480
We're going to be playing the newest game release on the block. We just picked this up from GameStop.

564
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,680
Came out yesterday. We went to the midnight release. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's 2006. Yeah.

565
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,960
We're fucking, we're stroked and we're poked. I can't wait to play Red Steel and Twilight Princess.

566
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
I can't wait to play Call of Duty, the first one.

567
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,600
Fucking, I'm so ready. I'm gonna put on my wrist strap because you gotta have your wrist strap on.

568
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,360
Yeah, but mine doesn't have one. Okay, well, you're fucked. What the shit.

569
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,320
I can actually go and sue GameStop with that fucking asshole, Paul, trying to outsell me. Paul,

570
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,360
if you're watching this right now and you were, if you work at GameStop and your name is Paul,

571
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,520
fucking come to the comments. We're going to find you, give us your address, post them in the

572
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,280
comments below, and then you're going to figure out, you're going to figure out why Storm's a

573
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:10,200
named it for people. Fucking Paul, I go to pay for the Wii remote and he is like, I'm like,

574
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,680
I just make, I just make a small talk. I just make the observation that like, oh, when, when your

575
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,080
chip gets confirmed, it's like, it doesn't sound very encouraging. And then he's like, oh, well,

576
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,440
he's kind of thinking about it differently. Just imagine you're playing an eight-bit video game

577
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,120
and you're winning. Just like imagine that you're playing a video game and then the world will make

578
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,880
sense to you. And then the world will be true and real and just your fucking like, are you sure

579
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,920
you don't want to play it? Are you sure you want to get the power-ups card? And you're like, no.

580
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,120
You're like, you've never had one before and you're like, no. You're like, are you sure you don't

581
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,960
want one? You want to win us to point? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even for free points, you're like, no.

582
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:54,360
Did I just say no? Yeah. No, no. No. Like, I'm glad you finally got the message. Yeah. Like, good on

583
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,440
him. Oh, okay, okay, okay. We're going to play all these games, but what you want me to do first?

584
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,320
You want to go in order? Yeah, just go in order. Okay. Tennis. Tennis is like the most premiere,

585
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,800
like fucking like- I don't know about you, but my cardiovascular endurance is through the roof.

586
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,120
I dumped all my points into this. Yeah, I'm going to soda and then I'll fucking be there.

587
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm going to the glittery- I guess it's water, whatever.

588
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Power.

589
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Power.

590
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,880
Okay. Get ready to die. Fuck yeah. Get ready to die, viewers. I'm so ready. Not you, the

591
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,400
viewers. I'm so ready. I'm so ready for death. I'm so fucking psyched. I'm so fucking pumped.

592
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,520
Uh, yeah, right hand. You're right handed, right? Of course. Only fucking freaks and jugglers are

593
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,840
left in. I mean only beautiful, strong, independent people. Oh my god. Wait, hang on.

594
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:02,600
I got it. I got it. Oh, oh my god. Oh, a little crispy. Yeah. I gotta get stretched. I gotta get

595
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,760
lubed. I gotta get limber. Fucking warm up. Wait, no, I actually have to like crack my back.

596
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,720
Oh my god. Your bones are fucking solidified right before my eyes. They just come apart

597
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,480
under under pressure. Under the right circumstances. Just like my personality. Well, I need a certain

598
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:30,120
some special somebody. Yes. Yeah, fucking me. Get it. You gotta hold it.

599
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:42,680
Hold it. Oh, uh, where's where's B? It's the it's the back one. Yeah. Okay. All right, come on.

600
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,560
Oh, oh, okay.

601
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,080
Okay, here we fucking go. I'm so fucking excited. I'm so, oh my god, we have two.

602
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,480
All right, uh, yeah, it's the best of five.

603
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,440
This is right. It's not supposed to be punctual. I don't understand. No, no, you will.

604
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Idiot.

605
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,000
God damn it. Oh, oh, oh my god. You're gonna fucking pay for your insolence.

606
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,040
We agree. We had a gentleman's agreement that you would lose this time. Yeah, well, I'm no gentleman.

607
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,120
God damn it. No.

608
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,120
It's a skill. Okay, this isn't true. This isn't true. I'm the best that we sport.

609
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,200
God damn it. I'm retarded.

610
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,520
All right. No, don't worry. No, don't worry audience. Don't worry.

611
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,080
God, the timing. I hate this replay.

612
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,600
I hate this fucking replay.

613
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,960
Idiot. Fucking moron. I can't believe you made a blender such as that in these how and hauls.

614
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,480
Fuck yeah. How do I even control the angle?

615
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:24,600
Fuck. Damn it. Wait, do you just, do we not pass the serve back and forth?

616
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,240
I don't know. Like, aren't you supposed to lose the serve when you, when I-

617
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,640
No, I think if I get a point, then you get it.

618
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,920
Fuck. Fuck yes. The game is just like you do it once and then you get an hour or you lose.

619
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,240
Yeah. Like, there's no, there's no coming back from a blender.

620
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,740
Yeah.

621
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,360
Or is there?

622
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yes. Go, go. Oh, come on. Oh, no.

623
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,840
That happened. What an incredible volley. What an incredible victory for me.

624
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,120
No, fuck. I don't mean to keep doing that. This is unbearable.

625
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
That was fucking sick. That was fucking epic.

626
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,040
I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna turn you into a fucking Native American.

627
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,840
Never. No. Yes. I should have just let it go.

628
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,920
Fucking yes. I want to see a rea- Ah, fuck.

629
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm gonna make you fucking emit greenhouse gases from your fucking nose.

630
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,040
Fuck. How do I make them go faster? Is there any way for that to be the case?

631
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
I have no idea. I'm-

632
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,760
Fuck.

633
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,080
Fuck. How is he-

634
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,720
Fuck, yes.

635
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,240
How is he even supposed to do it?

636
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,920
Ha, there's no way.

637
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,960
You're about to lose, white boy.

638
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,720
No!

639
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Dude.

640
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,560
You fucked, idiot.

641
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't worry. My idiocy has nothing to do with my ability to play or win, Tennis.

642
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,360
No!

643
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,600
This is fucking retarded. It doesn't make any sense.

644
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,560
How am I supposed to do?

645
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,480
Yeah, like how do you even control the angle?

646
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,440
Damn it!

647
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,080
That incredible edge-guarding. The net-guarding skill.

648
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm not doing anything differently.

649
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,640
This doesn't even matter. This isn't even fucking real.

650
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,720
Oh, I should have gone for it at the net.

651
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Come on!

652
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,480
Yes!

653
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,960
Fuck yeah.

654
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,480
Fuck yeah. Fuck yes. Fuck yes. It doesn't even matter.

655
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,560
Come on, you idiot.

656
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,680
Don't!

657
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,240
No, no, no.

658
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,800
I'm weak, man.

659
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,360
No, no, no.

660
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,080
You little bans. You little bans. You gotta fucking get me.

661
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,280
You little bans.

662
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,280
My back is so fucking like a steel rod that I'll never be able to know true happiness.

663
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,480
Yes!

664
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Did it like matter which direction I swing?

665
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,800
I have no clue.

666
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,840
How was that not a hit?

667
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,680
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

668
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,280
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.

669
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,400
Well, did you just win?

670
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Get, no, no, it's best to five.

671
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,480
All right.

672
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,400
No!

673
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,840
That doesn't even count.

674
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,000
See that incredible restraint that I showed there?

675
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,240
You knew, you knew.

676
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,880
Then say the legendary restraint attribute.

677
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Damn it, that doesn't even make any sense.

678
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,160
That doesn't make any sense.

679
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,760
If we're being honest with ourselves, that doesn't make any sense.

680
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,160
Uh, I don't, I don't have any opinion about that.

681
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,840
And, and frankly I'm confused.

682
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:13,720
No, yes, yes, oh my god, that was gay.

683
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,720
All right, okay.

684
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,240
I need to come back from the fucking courthouse.

685
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Okay, well, well, all right.

686
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,000
If I lose, I'm going to go to fucking jail.

687
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,440
Yep, that's the agreement.

688
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,840
That's the jailman's agreement that we had.

689
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,120
Fucking I hate you.

690
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,600
God damn it.

691
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,680
Whatever, doesn't even make any sense.

692
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,520
This game has no fucking rules.

693
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Yes.

694
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
Damn it, no!

695
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,120
Look at the determination in my eyes.

696
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,560
This is fucking retarded.

697
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,720
No, never play again, quit.

698
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,480
Wait, that took like 30 minutes.

699
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,720
Oh wait, wait, I'm including the, making the video.

700
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,160
Yeah, but okay, fucking, this is such,

701
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,800
even though that was a cheat, even though you cheated,

702
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,840
and even, even though that was conclu, conclusion at play,

703
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,520
and you fucking sucked the dick of the referee in order to get that point through,

704
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,640
like 9% of those points.

705
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
That seems like the kind of thing I would do.

706
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,160
Even though that, this is a great change of pace,

707
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,000
from the fucking awful, rigorous, you know, like, like, this is our vacation.

708
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,000
This is our vacation from the living nightmare that is frog fractures.

709
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,920
Yeah, yeah, we finally got, and now we get to take a break and fucking relax,

710
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,680
you know, limber up our muscles, fucking butter up our assholes and fucking,

711
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
just go to town.

712
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah.

713
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,240
Wait, am I pitching?

714
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,480
Yeah.

715
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,640
Come on, you, you dumb fuck.

716
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,720
You stupid, ugly asshole.

717
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,000
Hey, man.

718
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,520
Wait, wait, excuse that way a little bit.

719
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,200
Okay.

720
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm fucking ready.

721
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm fucking ready for you.

722
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,120
Aim your pitch with, oh, I see.

723
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:10,680
I don't even know what those things are.

724
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
Oh my god, look at all these people.

725
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,760
Those are all our friends.

726
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

727
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,160
All, all our, oh, look at that.

728
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,040
Oh my god.

729
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,360
I'm so fucking ready.

730
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,720
You're going to fucking eat shit and die.

731
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,200
We'll see.

732
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
J, there's a home run right now.

733
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,320
No, no, hold on, no, hold on, hold on.

734
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,960
This game sucks.

735
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,400
It fucking doesn't make any sense.

736
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,480
You're a tad late there.

737
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,400
I don't, this doesn't, this is fucking stupid.

738
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,480
This doesn't make any sense.

739
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,320
I want out.

740
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,360
That's, that doesn't make any sense.

741
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,440
This is, this is kind of fucking Japanese, isn't it?

742
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,360
All right, we're doing good.

743
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,960
All right, I'm liking this game so far.

744
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,320
Fuck.

745
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,080
No.

746
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,200
Okay, Phantom Ho.

747
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,920
Okay, okay.

748
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
What kind of a stupid name is that?

749
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,440
Yes, home run.

750
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,760
No.

751
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh fuck.

752
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,600
This game doesn't make any fucking sense.

753
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,880
Almost, almost.

754
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,920
Oh, I don't even mean to throw it.

755
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,560
Oh shit.

756
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,400
What did I even do?

757
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,920
Did I have to throw it to the base?

758
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,080
I threw it as you immediately caught.

759
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,480
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

760
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,200
Hold it towards me and then I, okay.

761
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,520
Oh, here we go.

762
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,480
I hate you.

763
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
Yeah, get fucked.

764
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,480
What?

765
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,600
They hit the ground.

766
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Doesn't matter.

767
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,040
What do you mean?

768
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,680
Doesn't matter.

769
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,760
These are the rules of baseball.

770
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,480
Wow, huh?

771
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,080
Fucking sheep got his fucking ba-ba wet.

772
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,160
Oh, move over, move over.

773
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,280
Oh, what's going on here?

774
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,240
Look what the cat dragged.

775
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
It's gonna die.

776
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,240
Okay, okay.

777
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,440
I gotta fucking get it together.

778
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,120
What's that on your shoe, huh?

779
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
Is it fucking pride?

780
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,880
Who can't play this game?

781
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,920
What is this?

782
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,640
What is it?

783
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,680
We're changing.

784
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,000
All right.

785
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,720
Okay, that's the game.

786
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,320
We won't have zero points.

787
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,520
Game over, game over.

788
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,720
Okay.

789
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,120
All right.

790
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,960
The street continues.

791
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,720
Fuck.

792
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Cool.

793
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,160
All right.

794
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,800
Okay, good.

795
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,000
Okay.

796
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,520
All right.

797
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,160
All right, cool.

798
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,240
All right, fucking come on.

799
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:25,880
Imagine if you paid like $60 to get into the fucking stadium.

800
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,440
No, what the fuck?

801
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,360
How do you score?

802
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Do you have to hit a homerun and that's just it?

803
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,200
Oh, oh, shit.

804
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,360
Wait, am I out?

805
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,280
Okay, I thought I was gonna be out again.

806
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,280
All right, fuck yes.

807
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,400
Fuck.

808
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
I dare you to do that again.

809
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,360
All right.

810
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,720
Well, it's not even mean to throw that one.

811
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,440
Oh my god.

812
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,920
No, oh my god.

813
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,040
No, oh my god.

814
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,440
No.

815
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,240
All right.

816
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,280
No.

817
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,160
You know what they say?

818
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,160
So bad.

819
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,360
Ryan, look at this fucking big little basket, little piece of shit.

820
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,000
Little fucking hat.

821
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,040
I guess he's got a tight boy.

822
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,680
Pussy.

823
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:12,920
Fuck.

824
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,800
I mean, I guess so.

825
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,920
I guess that's what's communicating.

826
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,720
God damn it.

827
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,360
No.

828
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,960
Okay.

829
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,760
Well, these guys are so fucking good at catching things.

830
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,720
Well, I hope you're going to be able to eat shit after you die,

831
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,160
because that's what you're going to need to do.

832
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,440
Ah.

833
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Maybe you shouldn't have eaten all those fucking poops.

834
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,320
I mean, yeah, I didn't have to.

835
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,160
Maybe you shouldn't have gone in that fucking orphanage

836
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,520
and taken all their babas out.

837
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,920
But even though you were a little baby, you had to do it.

838
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:55,960
Wow.

839
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,640
Oh god.

840
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,760
Let's see what I sound like.

841
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,000
Don't wear enough.

842
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,200
I can't pop fly.

843
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,840
Oh god.

844
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,640
This is the hardest fucking game of all time.

845
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,080
You can't play.

846
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,440
We're going to fucking break our fucking bones.

847
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,840
Like one of us is going to get a home run completely by luck,

848
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,120
and that's going to be the whole game.

849
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,920
Yeah.

850
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,400
There it is.

851
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,120
There's the game.

852
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,000
There's the game.

853
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,600
One by chance.

854
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
I don't know how I did that.

855
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,160
I think we're both like the same.

856
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,400
Yeah.

857
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,880
We're both powerless.

858
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,680
We're just being carried along by the amber waves of grain

859
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
that is resports.

860
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,800
Nobody's getting out.

861
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,560
All right.

862
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

863
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,560
Phantom Owl.

864
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:57,960
Yeah.

865
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,960
Traitor.

866
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,040
This is the worst fucking.

867
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,400
How long is this?

868
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
This is just like real baseball.

869
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,280
How long is baseball?

870
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Nine innings.

871
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,240
Oh no.

872
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,120
No.

873
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Coward.

874
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Whatever.

875
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,240
Wait.

876
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,720
Wait what?

877
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,080
Do we have to?

878
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,400
All right.

879
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,600
Ow.

880
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,920
I don't think it like matters where I throw it.

881
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,120
It seems like it's all about the timing.

882
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,320
Like my bad doesn't even go where it is though.

883
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,480
All right.

884
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,880
Fuck.

885
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,920
Fuck.

886
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,720
Ow.

887
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,200
It's out.

888
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,640
Great.

889
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,880
Today I learned that it's impossible to play baseball.

890
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,480
It's impossible.

891
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,000
You can't like I dare you to try.

892

Hiroshim.

894
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,360
Fuck you.

895
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,040
God damn it.

896
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,520
America's pastime ladies and gentlemen.

897
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,400
You did come out of this.

898
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,880
Oh no.

899
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,600
No I was about to fucking cry.

900
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,440
Incredible.

901
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh my god.

902
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,200
You could you could score.

903
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,160
You could actually score.

904
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,560
I could.

905
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,000
But you won't.

906
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,680
Don't be so sure.

907
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,520
Don't be so sure.

908
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
Don't be so cocky kid.

909
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,760
Don't.

910
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,160
All right.

911
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,120
Well maybe you should just get your face fucking obliterated before you come to my house.

912
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,480
No.

913
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,000
That fucking girl.

914
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,120
You're done.

915
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,600
That's it.

916
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,640
You're fucking done.

917
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,120
You're done.

918
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,000
There's nothing you can do.

919
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,560
I can't.

920
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,440
I can't win this.

921
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Peg stand up.

922
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,640
Come on Peg stand up.

923
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,640
All right.

924
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,520
Well that's unfair.

925
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,200
All right.

926
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,760
That's cheating.

927
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,480
There's just fucking collusion of play.

928
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,520
I'm not going to sit here and fucking take it.

929
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm not going to walk away quietly.

930
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
If there's something wrong I need to fucking say it.

931
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,160
God damn it.

932
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,360
Okay.

933
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,640
If I don't win this I'm going to fucking literally get my asshole blown up.

934
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm going to die.

935
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,560
No.

936
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:19,800
No.

937
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:20,920
No.

938
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,200
All right.

939
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,720
This isn't fucking fair.

940
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh no.

941
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:31,880
Come on.

942
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,520
Come on.

943
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,160
You're dumb.

944
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,880
You're fucking dumb.

945
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,880
Single.

946
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,840
Stupid.

947
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,360
That's what I am if you know what I mean.

948
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,920
Coward.

949
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,680
Good.

950
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,320
Excellent.

951
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,720
Got it.

952
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,240
Come on.

953
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,440
Fuck yes.

954
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Say.

955
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,240
All right.

956
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,320
All right.

957
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,800
Here we go.

958
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Fucking bincing himself.

959
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,600
Get raped.

960
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:05,800
No.

961
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,240
No.

962
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,880
Don't want that.

963
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,280
No.

964
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,480
Not going to happen friend.

965
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,560
No.

966
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,800
No.

967
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:11,960
No.

968
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,400
Literally.

969
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,440
These guys are so fucking good at catching the ball.

970
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,160
It's unreal.

971
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,200
Say.

972
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,840
Today I landed.

973
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,400
I hate America.

974
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Donald Trump invented baseball.

975
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,160
Not like he did.

976
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,200
So I have to boycott it.

977
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,880
When we fucking impeach Donald Trump,

978
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,160
baseball is going to go right with him.

979
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,480
God.

980
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,600
No.

981
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,600
Just stop.

982
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,280
Good.

983
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,240
How many foul balls do you get?

984
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,440
As many as you want.

985
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,000
Really?

986
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,840
You can't out on a foul.

987
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,160
Great.

988
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,840
Excellent.

989
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,280
I won.

990
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,680
Fuck you.

991
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,560
I fucking won.

992
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,120
Fuck you.

993
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,680
You listen.

994
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
It's because you're a punk ass little bitch.

995
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,440
And you can't fucking swing source.

996
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,040
Because you can't swing source.

997
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,000
You just can't finangle long devices.

998
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,280
You're fucking collusion.

999
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
There's no collusion here.

1000
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,120
Both of those.

1001
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,640
No.

1002
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,600
Not playing games.

1003
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,000
No.

1004
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,160
No.

1005
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,240
No.

1006
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,800
No.

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,440
No.

1008
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,600
No.

1009
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,000
No.

1010
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,480
No.

1011
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,560
No.

1012
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,520
You misunderstand again.

1013
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,400
You misunderstand.

1014
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,040
All right.

1015
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,320
Now I should warn you Ben.

1016
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,800
Yeah.

1017
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,960
I am the best person in the entire world at We Sports Bowling.

1018
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,360
Okay.

1019
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,080
And you will never defeat me no matter what you do.

1020
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,400
Sure.

1021
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,640

Yeah.

1025
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,000
I feel it.

1026
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,560

Yeah.

1029
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,840
Well it did.

1030
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,720
Why not take a break?

1031
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:37,880
Yeah.

1032
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,360
Fucking right.

1033
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,080
No.

1034
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,240
No.

1035
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,880
No.

1036
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,360
Never.

1037
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Do you know who you're talking to right now?

1038
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,520
We're Frosty Joe and ICP.

1039

Prickly Jack.

1048
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,040

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,280
Is this a demo?

1054
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,040
Or did it say?

1055
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,640
I have no idea what would just happen.

1056
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:13,960
Good.

1057
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,400

Excellent.

1087
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,400
Good job.

1088
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,480
Good job.

1089
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,960
Good job.

1090
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,200
Good job.

1091
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,600
A man.

1092
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,360
No.

1093
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,400
No wrong.

1094
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,000
Bad idea.

1095
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,320
Bad idea buster.

1096
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,760
So I'll take it.

1097
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,120
All right.

1098
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,840
Okay.

1099
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,160
Cool.

1100
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,600
You're fucking done.

1101
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,240
Talk a meanie.

1102
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,280
You're fucking done kid.

1103
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,080
Motherfucker.

1104
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,600
Have you ever heard of giving birth?

1105
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,520
Because that's what you're about to do to my fucking kid.

1106
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,440
Fuck yeah.

1107
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,560
You fucking.

1108
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,160
That ball's about to go into your fucking.

1109
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,440
Let's be a bitch.

1110
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,680
That ball's about to fucking give birth to you.

1111
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,040
No.

1112
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,040
No I won't allow it.

1113
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
That's what I did.

1114
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,400
No you just don't understand.

1115
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,800
You just don't understand.

1116
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,640
You're just too caught up in like in like the reality of the situation.

1117
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,720
You get back into the physical the physicality of it.

1118
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,600
What does that mean?

1119
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
You're just too caught up in like in like the reality.

1120
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,440
You need to let your spirit fucking fly.

1121
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,560
I think it's because I keep like accidentally hitting the two button with my palm.

1122
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,840
Impossible.

1123
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,920
Impossible.

1124
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,680
No that's wrong.

1125
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,960
No that's wrong.

1126
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,160
No that's wrong.

1127
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,120
Yeah.

1128
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,600
Buster.

1129
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,080
No no no.

1130
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,800
You don't understand.

1131
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,200
That's wrong.

1132
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,760
You didn't you didn't.

1133
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,920
You're going down Buster Brown.

1134
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,600
You didn't even fucking download that game.

1135
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,560
No it doesn't fucking exist.

1136
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,240
Oh you can.

1137
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,240
How do you do that?

1138
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,000
You're fucking dead is what I'm trying to say.

1139
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,320
Damn it.

1140
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,280
They all booed at me.

1141
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,520
Damn it.

1142
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,800
This is such a bullshit.

1143
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,920
That's spare.

1144
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,280
You didn't even fucking train.

1145
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,240
22.

1146
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,680
You didn't even fucking train.

1147
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,760
Oh good.

1148
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,800
Damn it.

1149
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,640
It's fine.

1150
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,040
It's fine.

1151
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,000
I didn't even want it to exist.

1152
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,720
No.

1153
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,040
No.

1154
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,520
No.

1155
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:32,760
No.

1156
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,720
No.

1157
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,200
Damn it.

1158
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,120
God fucking damn it.

1159
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,840
I hate you.

1160
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,440
I want you to know that I'll never forgive you for these transgressions.

1161
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Okay.

1162
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,800
Okay.

1163
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,840
All right that's fine.

1164
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,840
Listen if you just want to be gay and suck dick in the middle of the football stadium

1165
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,360
then that's fine at all.

1166
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,600
Just don't just don't do it in front of my kids all right.

1167
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,120
Thanks for your blessing.

1168
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,240
You're dead.

1169
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,040
You're fucking done.

1170
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,520
You're dead.

1171
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,560
You're fucking done.

1172
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,400
Oh my god.

1173
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,000
Check out this fucking shit bro.

1174
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,720
Oh my god.

1175
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,360
There's nothing more powerful than a man with nothing left to lose.

1176
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,240
No.

1177
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,880
No you're wrong.

1178
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,800
You're wrong.

1179
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,920
All right.

1180
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,320
Okay.

1181
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,680
Why'd you flood this?

1182
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,440
All right.

1183
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:50,920
All right.

1184
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,560
All right.

1185
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,040
All right.

1186
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,520
Wow.

1187
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,080
Trick shot.

1188
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,440
That doesn't matter.

1189
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
That doesn't matter.

1190
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,800
No.

1191
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,520
Oh my god.

1192
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,080
Things are heating up.

1193
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,960
Things are purpleing.

1194
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,760
Things are boiling.

1195
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,080
That's pretty good.

1196
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,840
Come on.

1197
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,640
Don't you fuck with me.

1198
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,360
Don't you fuck with me.

1199
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah.

1200
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,920
If I don't get a good role this one I'm really fucked.

1201
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,560
You're really gonna get a good role.

1202
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,680
Like I really need this role.

1203
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
I'm gonna roll over your fucking grave.

1204
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm gonna roll in my grave thinking about you.

1205
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:32,920
All right.

1206
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,480
I'll take it.

1207
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,360
Taste that pain.

1208
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,680
Whatever.

1209
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,080
Whatever.

1210
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,440
Whatever.

1211
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,840
Yeah.

1212
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,160
Yeah.

1213
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,720
Yeah.

1214
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,280
Whatever.

1215
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,760
Whatever.

1216
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,960
I can still make it.

1217
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,440
Whatever.

1218
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,600
Damn it.

1219
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:00,920
Fuck.

1220
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,120
Oh.

1221
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,520
Oh.

1222
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:03,880
Shit.

1223
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,400
Look at that.

1224
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,000
Fuck yes.

1225
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,240
All right.

1226
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,800
Doesn't even matter.

1227
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,600
Doesn't even matter.

1228
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,880
Doesn't even fucking matter.

1229
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,280
Motherfuck.

1230
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,000
No.

1231
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,960
I'm just too powerful for your fucking human mind

1232
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,600
to comprehend.

1233
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,720
You're a little powerful.

1234
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,800
I have to give you that.

1235
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,240
You're a little bit powerful.

1236
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
I can sense the power radiating off of you.

1237
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,520
Oh my god.

1238
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,160
You're gonna land up in fucking jail.

1239
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,040
I'm getting closer.

1240
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,760
I'm getting closer.

1241
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,560
Oh.

1242
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,040
Oh.

1243
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,680
Damn it.

1244
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,160
Oh.

1245
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,720
You're a dick.

1246
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:51,800
You're a dick.

1247
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,440
Delectable.

1248
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,040
No.

1249
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1250
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,120
Damn it.

1251
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,480
Whatever.

1252
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,360
It's just one pin.

1253
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,000
Just one pin.

1254
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,840
Don't matter.

1255
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,480
Look at me.

1256
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:05,880
Look at me.

1257
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,720
Let me fucking scoop it up your brain.

1258
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah.

1259
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,240
Wait, where?

1260
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,040
I'm fucking winning.

1261
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,760
Oh, shit.

1262
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,520
Wait, where?

1263
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:14,840
Where are you?

1264
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,560
You should be in my brain.

1265
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,120
Wait, what's going on?

1266
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,600
Uh-uh.

1267
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,400
Hey.

1268
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,080
Come on.

1269
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,000
Bitch.

1270
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,120
You little bug.

1271
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Do I dare?

1272
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,640
Dude, try.

1273
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,320
Yes.

1274
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,720
Power.

1275
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,120
If I fucking lose this,

1276
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,560
I'm gonna call the fucking buffalo.

1277
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,360
Oh my god.

1278
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1279
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
No, no, no, bad.

1280
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,840
Hey.

1281
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,960
I'm exuberating fucking joy and warmth,

1282
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
like louder and more potent

1283
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,120
than a Native American brims of petroleum.

1284
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,160
I'm fucking, I'm burning that right up.

1285
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,000
Mother nature's giving me a handy.

1286
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,040
Spiritually.

1287
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,720
Native Americans didn't have guns.

1288
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,520
They didn't have guns.

1289
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm so fucking embarrassed.

1290
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,280
Just do it.

1291
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,760
Do it.

1292
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,720
Wee bowling.

1293
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,360
Do it.

1294
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,480
You won't pull the trigger.

1295
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,480
Oh my god.

1296
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,280
That's so bad.

1297
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,720
Then how could you try to trap it?

1298
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,520
So shit.

1299
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,520
Oh, wow.

1300
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,720
Shit.

1301
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,560
Oh my god.

1302
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,960
Whatever.

1303
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,880
It's a split, split, split, split, split, split.

1304
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,080
Don't matter.

1305
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Going for the safe too, like a coward.

1306
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,480
No.

1307
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,040
This is unbearable.

1308
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,920
This is unbearably potent.

1309
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Even if you get a strike, I'll still be in the lead.

1310
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,680
Even if you get a strike, I'll still be in the lead.

1311
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,320
Actually, that's not true.

1312
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,600
No, that's definitely not true.

1313
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,200
I forgot.

1314
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,400
All right, well.

1315
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,920
You're definitely gonna fucking knock that DS, by the way.

1316
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,920
Oh my god.

1317
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,600
At one point, did I win?

1318
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,160
Yes.

1319
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,000
Fuck.

1320
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,480
Yes.

1321
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:45,880
God.

1322
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,760
That is the face of a fucking loser.

1323
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,240
That's the face of a fucking racist.

1324
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,280
You didn't let the buffalo stampede on your ground.

1325
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,840
And now I'm gonna stampede on your heart.

1326
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,720
What a mistake.

1327
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,400
Shit.

1328
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,960
You wouldn't sell the land back to the people you stole it from,

1329
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,280
and now you're gonna pay dearly in hell.

1330
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,040
I didn't want it bad enough.

1331
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,840
That's what happened.

1332
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,120
Fuck you.

1333
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1334
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,600
I'm representing all, no, I didn't want to do anything.

1335
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1336
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,680
I represent all Native Americans.

1337
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,400
Yeah, you speak for them.

1338
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,680
And you represent all whites.

1339
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,720
He speaks for them.

1340
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,400
I speak for the trees.

1341
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,520
I speak for the people without voices,

1342
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,720
aka all Native Americans.

1343
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,920
They can't speak for themselves.

1344
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,400
Don't worry, guys.

1345
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,680
If you're a Native American, don't worry.

1346
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,560
I'll do it for you.

1347
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,080
All right.

1348
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,120
An expert.

1349
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,120
Oh god, I'm full with.

1350
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,520
Nigh-hole.

1351
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,240
You want to namp Nigh-

1352
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,880
Let's do a Nigh-hole.

1353
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,680
Yeah, let's do a Nigh-hole.

1354
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,880
Fuck yes.

1355
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,680
Fuck yes.

1356
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,040
Okay, we're still going.

1357
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,240
No problem.

1358
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,280
No problems yet.

1359
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:50,760
Fuck yeah.

1360
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,520
Let me show me up my hips.

1361
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,800
Here, let me lower it.

1362
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,800
All right, that's it.

1363
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,320
Okay, didn't mean to do that.

1364
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,960
Okay, good.

1365
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,280
All right, how do I play the game?

1366
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,680
You can.

1367
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,520
That's not a feature that comes with the game.

1368
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,200
All right, okay, I am.

1369
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,560
Oh my god.

1370
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,000
Sliced it or something.

1371
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I fucking diced it, bro.

1372
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,800
Look how fucking powerful that was.

1373
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,600
Hold on, hold on.

1374
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm going to center this a little better.

1375
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,880
There we go.

1376
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,360
Okay.

1377
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,760
Excellent.

1378
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,120
Just try.

1379
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,680
Just try.

1380
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,240
I'm going.

1381
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,640
Just try.

1382
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,120
I'm going.

1383
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,800
You give me a second.

1384
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,760
Cheese, dude.

1385
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,320
Okay, okay.

1386
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,480
Wait, so what do I do?

1387
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,440
Do I have to hold a button?

1388
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,640
I don't know.

1389
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,640
Fuck you.

1390
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,480
You fucking, you hold down A and then you like swing it.

1391
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,160
Just like.

1392
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,000
No, like a fucking club.

1393
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,600
Like a golf.

1394
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,200
Do it like a golf.

1395
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,200
Do I have to release A when I hit?

1396
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,560
I don't think so.

1397
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,080
Oh, idiot.

1398
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:45,960
All right.

1399
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,840
Where, where?

1400
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Oh, oh fuck.

1401
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,320
Oh fuck.

1402
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,720
How do I?

1403
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,400
Is it because I'm still closer or something?

1404
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:53,880
I guess.

1405
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,800
I guess I just drove hard into the paint.

1406
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,640
All right, sure.

1407
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,200
Okay, okay.

1408
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,840
You're roughed it.

1409
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,560
You're roughed it, bro.

1410
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,120
Okay, whatever.

1411
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,760
You're roughing it.

1412
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,480
Oh god, look at me.

1413
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,680
Look how serene I am.

1414
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,360
Look how fucking beautiful.

1415
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,200
What the fuck?

1416
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,000
You're gonna hold, you have to hold A.

1417
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,760
I know, I know, but I'm trying to like test it.

1418
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,240
This seriously makes no sense to me.

1419
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,560
Yeah.

1420
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,920
It's just like you just, you just hit it.

1421
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,680
I don't know what your deal is.

1422
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,320
I just, what?

1423
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:39,720
Oh no.

1424
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:40,920
Oh no.

1425
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,160
Yeah, okay, sure.

1426
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,960
Driver.

1427
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,800
Oh, I see.

1428
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,760
Okay, I want to go with like

1429
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,880
fuck, power.

1430
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:02,920
What?

1431
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,880
I fucking swung.

1432
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,360
It didn't, great.

1433
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,360
Did it clip the tree?

1434
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,520
I, I don't know what's going on.

1435
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,280
I have no clue what's fucking going on.

1436
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,800
I think I hate this game.

1437
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,400
Yeah, that's probably the worst thing

1438
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,440
we've ever done in our lives.

1439
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,000
There's gonna be nine holes, nine holes of this.

1440
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Good.

1441
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1442
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,120
Excellent.

1443
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:51,000
Truly remarkable.

1444
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,600
What the fuck?

1445
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,680
What are you putting this on at?

1446
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,000
What?

1447
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,440
You were like, you like practiced it so carefully.

1448
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:10,600
Yeah.

1449
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,960
And then like, oh, here we go.

1450
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:29,000
Worthless.

1451
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,000
No.

1452
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,240
I think that was, no, no.

1453
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,440
Nine holes, nine holes was a mistake.

1454
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,280
Yeah, this was, this was a horrible idea.

1455
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,560
Okay.

1456
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,120
I don't even want to do one.

1457
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,280
No.

1458
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,400
I mean,

1459
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,680
all right.

1460
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,800
I'm probably getting the hang of this game

1461
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,720
and the more I understand the less I want to play it.

1462
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,200
We can stop early, maybe.

1463
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,440
No.

1464
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,200
Okay, never mind.

1465
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:04,840
That was a lie.

1466
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,000
Fuck.

1467
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:13,880
Idiot.

1468
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,160
Maximum over putt.

1469
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,480
I'm gonna put you in the next week.

1470
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:33,960
Shit, Christ, idiot.

1471
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,840
I'm so effing.

1472
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,040
You are.

1473
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,400
You could walk into fucking Kanye West's apartment.

1474
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,200
He wouldn't even know.

1475
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,680
You're so sneaky.

1476
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:49,640
Idiot.

1477
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,240
I'm like, can't, we're just playing.

1478
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,840
Yep.

1479
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:15,960
Okay.

1480
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,800
Oh, it.

1481
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,120
It has no fucking clue.

1482
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,120
Oh, no.

1483
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,000
It has absolutely no idea.

1484
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,640
It does.

1485
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,000
It doesn't know where my remote is.

1486
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,960
I just have to fucking pray.

1487
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,200
Yeah.

1488
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,160
That would have been perfect.

1489
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,960
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

1490
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,080
I'm never gonna get that in, by the way.

1491
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,840
I will never get that in my entire life.

1492
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,040
No, it's gonna glitch out.

1493
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:01,800
Okay.

1494
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:03,800
Yep.

1495
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,000
Fuck.

1496
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,600
You're fucking dead, kid.

1497
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,080
Damn it.

1498
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Dude, it's like trying to get the ball into the hole

1499
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,160
from this length is like being sweet bro and hello, Jeff.

1500
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,240
Trying to get the ball out of the door.

1501
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,080
I need to know what angel to eat.

1502
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,040
It gets impossible.

1503
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,880
Like the closer you are, the harder it gets.

1504
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,080
Fuck.

1505
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,760
Oh, oh, oh.

1506
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,480
Never mind.

1507
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,280
Now it's wrong.

1508
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,760
Yes.

1509
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,120
I was wrong about what I said.

1510
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,320
I figured out the angel.

1511
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,440
You figured out the angel.

1512
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,720
Fuck yes.

1513
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,120
Someday.

1514
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,320
Hey, hey, hey.

1515
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,440
Do you think you're gonna never mind?

1516
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:55,720
Please.

1517
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,440
Please never make it in.

1518
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,440
Please never win this game.

1519
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:07,560
What?

1520
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,440
It's doing the opposite of what I tell it to.

1521
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,120
No.

1522
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,720
Look, I swing it and it goes backwards.

1523
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,040
It's not precise enough to actually do measurements.

1524
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,560
So it's just like you have to just fucking hope.

1525
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,160
You have to hope with all your fucking dick in your heart.

1526
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,520
Don't fuck it up.

1527
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,160
Okay.

1528
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,400
Fuck.

1529
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,480
Tripping bogey.

1530
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,720
Fuck yes.

1531
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,400
All right, all right.

1532
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,080
Second hole of a nine hole game.

1533
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,800
Oh my god.

1534
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,200
Jesus.

1535
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,560
Yeah, just go right into the sand trap.

1536
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,880
That's what I want to see.

1537
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:51,880
Yes.

1538
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,680
Oh, that delay.

1539
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:02,760
Okay.

1540
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Is your skull just lagged?

1541
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,400
I don't know.

1542
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,800
I don't understand what the fuck is happening.

1543
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,640
That's pretty good.

1544
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,320
Mike on the sand trap.

1545
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,360
No.

1546
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,000
No, it actually sucked dig.

1547
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,120
All right, all right, all right.

1548
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,800
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six.

1549
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:47,080
You're definitely holding one, dude.

1550
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,520
Dude, we're holding fucking one.

1551
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:51,640
Okay.

1552
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,960
Oh my god.

1553
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:06,680
Oh my god.

1554
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,560
Oh my god.

1555
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,840
I was going back and it registered me going forward.

1556
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,880
That was awesome.

1557
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,120
Whatever.

1558
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,800
Oh, in the hard rough.

1559
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,560
Oh my god.

1560
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,760
You're on stroke five.

1561
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,640
I have to go.

1562
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:31,960
All right.

1563
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,360
Six.

1564
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,480
Okay.

1565
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:43,800
Okay.

1566
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,280
Okay.

1567
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:44,840
This doesn't matter.

1568
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,640
It doesn't matter.

1569
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,240
Thoughtful, thoughtful approach.

1570
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,800
You're a thought.

1571
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,680
I'm going to approach you with a fucking knife.

1572
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,520
Okay.

1573
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,480
I think maybe because I was kind of using with my wrists

1574
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,360
and it didn't like that.

1575
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,400
Okay.

1576
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,480
Apparently I can't hit it at max power.

1577
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,480
I can only hit it at three quarters.

1578
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:17,880
Okay.

1579
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,200
Cool.

1580
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:18,680
Whatever.

1581
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,160
That's fine.

1582
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:21,720
Fuck.

1583
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:21,960
Okay.

1584
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,240
Well, I guess you did that time.

1585
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:24,680
Oh.

1586
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:25,880
Oh.

1587
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:29,640
Done.

1588
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,080
That's for retards, as I like to say.

1589
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,720
Good.

1590
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,200
You did it.

1591
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,280
Oh, hey, no, you get to go again.

1592
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:50,680
It's good.

1593
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,080
I thought I was using the putter again.

1594
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,480
Oh, there's a tree in the way.

1595
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,000
Tree in the way.

1596
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,560
I did not, did not, did not start me off with the,

1597
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,240
with the off hub I was using.

1598
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:05,480
No.

1599
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:05,880
No.

1600
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,160
Did you just switch to a random one right now?

1601
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,400
I think it just switches automatically to the one

1602
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,880
that it thinks is like the best match, distance-wise.

1603
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,480
Okay.

1604
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,000
I want to see it bounce off that tree, dude.

1605
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:16,920
Oh, okay.

1606
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,160
No.

1607
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,560
Fuck.

1608
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,600
Well, you almost got it.

1609
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,680
What?

1610
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,240
Did it just make you give up?

1611
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,720
It just forced me to give up?

1612
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,440
I think it did.

1613
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,600
Oh, I think it was because you got six stirrups behind,

1614
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,160
so it was just like-

1615
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,040
Oh, fucking dumb.

1616
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,600
You can't win.

1617
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,000
Fuck you.

1618
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,320
I guess it's to avoid a blowout where someone

1619
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,000
spends like 40 turns on one.

1620
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,400
Yeah.

1621
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,000
And then it's just like, well, it's pointless from here.

1622
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,400
Yeah.

1623
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:45,640
Yep.

1624
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,480
No.

1625
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,240
This game fucking sucks.

1626
01:05:59,160 --> 01:05:59,480
All right.

1627
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,720
It don't matter.

1628
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,840
What kind of fucking barbarian fucking like ruthless,

1629
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,960
uncivilized, non-gentified fucking society do you have to be

1630
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,320
in order to invent golf?

1631
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,240
To invent golf?

1632
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:17,880
Yeah.

1633
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,120
You have to be a savage.

1634
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,280
You have to be less than human.

1635
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,160
Then Neanderthals invented golf, and then the humans,

1636
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,000
and then the primitive humans just ate them.

1637
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,680
And they took up golf to mock them.

1638
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:32,920
Yeah.

1639
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,880
That's how the Neanderthals would extinct,

1640
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,200
that people would just use golf clubs to beat the shit out of them.

1641
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,080
You know, they're fun.

1642
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:41,560
Like you do.

1643
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,640
Hope you don't fucking die every shame.

1644
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:46,520
Yeah.

1645
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:48,680
Yeah, I could see that.

1646
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,480
Worst things have happened.

1647
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,840
Worst things have happened today.

1648
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,040
All right.

1649
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,520
Just win.

1650
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,120
Wow.

1651
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:58,840
Just kidding.

1652
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,640
I meant lose.

1653
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,000
Oh, no.

1654
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,040
No.

1655
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,280
No.

1656
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:04,920
Idiot.

1657
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,160
Dumb.

1658
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:07,960
I ruined it.

1659
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,360
Hey, it's me, it's me, it's KC Green.

1660
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,640
It's KC Green.

1661
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,040
I hope you all got your faces right.

1662
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,160
I got my face right.

1663
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,120
Let's go in here.

1664
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:20,920
Let's go.

1665
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,720
If I lose, I'm going to turn into a fucking...

1666
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,680
It's not another race.

1667
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,800
Fuck.

1668
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,920
Yes.

1669
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,720
Bitch.

1670
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:38,920
Fake.

1671
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,480
Boo to that.

1672
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,600
You are fake.

1673
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,320
Boo to that.

1674
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,800
You are a fake bitch.

1675
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,720
Sure.

1676
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,680
You are basic.

1677
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:54,760
Why will...

1678
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,760
Look, it's like we got my...

1679
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,040
Oh, because I'm on the rough.

1680
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,800
My power is limited because I'm on the rough.

1681
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,200
Now I understand.

1682
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:04,920
Whatever.

1683
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,120
Yeah, good.

1684
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:07,720
Excellent.

1685
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,920
But yep, good.

1686
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,240
Sick.

1687
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,960
That doesn't matter.

1688
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,680
That's fine.

1689
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:12,920
Yeah.

1690
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,120
That's fine.

1691
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,640
That's almost out of bounds, dawg.

1692
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,280
That's fine.

1693
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,920
That's fine, dude.

1694
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,800
It's not blows.

1695
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,360
It sucks.

1696
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,160
No, no.

1697
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:19,960
That has no bearing.

1698
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,200
That has zero homes.

1699
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,560
You could do it.

1700
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,760
If you fucking max powered it,

1701
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,880
you could like get it on the green.

1702
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,160
What the...

1703
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:29,480
What?

1704
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:32,760
Wait, what?

1705
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,000
What?

1706
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,640
Where's the ball?

1707
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,200
Show us the ball.

1708
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,120
Oh, no.

1709
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:46,840
There we go.

1710
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,480
You're fucking dead, dude.

1711
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, that was pretty cool, I gotta say.

1712
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,160
I just had to wiggle it a little bit.

1713
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,600
Oh my god.

1714
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,320
Oh my fucking god.

1715
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,920
Get ready.

1716
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,680
Get ready for your dick to be blown off.

1717
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,280
I will do.

1718
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:09,880
Shit.

1719
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh, that sucked.

1720
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,200
Kill me.

1721
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,880
All right, all right.

1722
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,720
I'm back and I'm ready for action.

1723
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,520
You've got attitude.

1724
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,320
You've got attitude.

1725
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,200
You're gonna make me fucking...

1726
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,120
You're gonna purr once I see you.

1727
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,320
Gross.

1728
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,080
No?

1729
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,320
Fuck.

1730
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,640
I was...

1731
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,280
No?

1732
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,520
All right.

1733
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,080
Fuck.

1734
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,600
I remember when I first played this game.

1735
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,800
And I thought, man, the motion controls are hard to use.

1736
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,160
I don't know if they're gonna catch on.

1737
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,040
And I was like, no.

1738
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,640
No, bro.

1739
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,600
This is the future.

1740
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,600
Looks like you fucking have the right idea you called it.

1741
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,040
Why does the...

1742
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,960
Why is the putter just lie to you, by the way?

1743
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,920
Why does it not appreciate what its actual max power is and like the range?

1744
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,200
I don't pretend to understand golf.

1745
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,640
I only pretend to love it.

1746
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,080
Exactly.

1747
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,720
It's like I'm impressed by fucking foolhardy friends.

1748
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,680
Look at the difference between max power and no power.

1749
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,240
No power?

1750
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,600
Max power.

1751
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:49,720
You are gonna learn so much when I'm coming through with you.

1752
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,280
God, I just want to get like near max.

1753
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,160
You're gonna learn the three reasons why people don't talk to people.

1754
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,920
Because things like this could happen.

1755
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1756
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:01,960
Oh my god.

1757
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,080
Run, run, run.

1758
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,560
Shit.

1759
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:18,600
What the fuck?

1760
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,280
Fuck.

1761
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:32,680
God damn it.

1762
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,160
Yes, I have so much bend.

1763
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,160
What you're lacking up is right here.

1764
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,000
You're lacking is right up here.

1765
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,840
You're lacking a little bit up the stairs.

1766
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,000
Are you talking about my sixth chakra?

1767
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,560
You just can't open your eye a little bit and then you're gonna be able to see clearly.

1768
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:57,400
Wrong.

1769
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:58,600
Wrong.

1770
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,160
What do you mean?

1771
01:11:59,160 --> 01:11:59,560
Wrong.

1772
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,040
It knows.

1773
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:02,520
It's good.

1774
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:03,560
Wrong.

1775
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:03,880
It's nice.

1776
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,680
What is this whole four?

1777
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,120
Okay.

1778
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,480
I don't know how much more I can take.

1779
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,880
Maybe one more or I don't know.

1780
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,840
No, we signed up.

1781
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,720
We signed up for it.

1782
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,840
We signed up for nine.

1783
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,600
Let's just try to end it quick.

1784
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,640
All right, fucking I hope you're ready for this.

1785
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,400
I think I'm gonna lose my entire mortgage and my income in my house.

1786
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,680
Oh, I'm fucking done.

1787
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,960
Oh, I'm in the fucking, I'm in the ground.

1788
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,400
I'm six feet under.

1789
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,560
Okay.

1790
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,240
I'm gonna be buried.

1791
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,360
What you guys doing?

1792
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,280
Playing golf.

1793
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:46,520
Yeah.

1794
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,320
We're playing the gentleman's sport.

1795
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,120
This is the worst game we've ever made.

1796
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,880
Every sports golf is awful.

1797
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,000
We know.

1798
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:55,960
Yeah.

1799
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,600
No.

1800
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:56,920
No.

1801
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,240
We sports is infallible.

1802
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,440
I said we sports golf.

1803
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:00,760
Okay.

1804
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,600
Specifically everything else is fine.

1805
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,400
We sports golf reminds me of what it was like to like watch my grandfather die.

1806
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,240
It's like a heart attack in the hospital.

1807
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,360
So it was pretty fun.

1808
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,800
Yeah, it was really sick.

1809
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,640
Oh, no.

1810
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,240
Oh, yes.

1811
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,360
No.

1812
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:20,760
Oh, yes.

1813
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,960
I think I'm gonna show you something really crazy.

1814
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,240
You're gonna be like, how would you do that?

1815
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:29,800
I'm gonna be like, huh?

1816
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,760
And that's pretty much the game.

1817
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,440
You're gonna be like.

1818
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,640
Golf tastes like pizza.

1819
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,480
I bet pizza would solve that problem.

1820
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,160
Oh.

1821
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,320
Oh, fuck you, bitch.

1822
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,360
Jesus, shit.

1823
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,120
It's time for the introvert revolution.

1824
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,240
It's time for introverts to take over.

1825
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,280
No, you've got it all wrong.

1826
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,440
I'm gonna tell you right now, you've got it all fucking wrong.

1827
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,680
You don't even know the secret.

1828
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,280
I figured out the secret.

1829
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:08,760
How?

1830
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,480
How could you possibly?

1831
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,920
Laws of attraction, my man.

1832
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,040
Laws of attraction.

1833
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:13,800
God, no.

1834
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,280
You didn't want it.

1835
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,320
You didn't want it hard enough.

1836
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,360
You didn't actually want it.

1837
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,040
You just thought you did.

1838
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,360
I was gonna sit down and wait and wait.

1839
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,080
No, I can't wait.

1840
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,120
I just have to be on the show.

1841
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,520
Why does it keep aiming me at the fucking sand trap?

1842
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,960
Because it thinks you're stupid.

1843
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,960
Well, maybe it's right.

1844
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,680
It knows me better than I know myself.

1845
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,320
See, that was perfect.

1846
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,120
Why can't I do that?

1847
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:45,960
Come on.

1848
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:49,640
What the fuck?

1849
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,160
What the fuck is happening?

1850
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,320
Yeah, that's what I want.

1851
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:53,800
Do that.

1852
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,040
Perfect.

1853
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,520
Okay, good.

1854
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,560
This is literally-

1855
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,400
This should just overshoot the sand trap.

1856
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,120
All right.

1857
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,080
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

1858
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,080
Powerful, powerful.

1859
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,080
Okay.

1860
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,200
No.

1861
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:25,720
Why?

1862
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:26,840
I didn't-

1863
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,280
I didn't do that.

1864
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,320
It worked out, I guess.

1865
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,080
I didn't do it.

1866
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,280
Damn.

1867
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,280
Whatever.

1868
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,000
It's pretty good.

1869
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,280
Whatever.

1870
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,240
It's pretty solid.

1871
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,760
You're like that one guy, which that-

1872
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,000
That one that everyone knows.

1873
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,680
Yeah, that one that everyone knows, and they're like,

1874
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,800
I don't like this guy anymore.

1875
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,320
Yeah, I know that guy.

1876
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:57,640
Sucks.

1877
01:15:59,400 --> 01:15:59,800
Oh, no.

1878
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,600
It's a hard knock life.

1879
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,000
Fuck.

1880
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,560
It's a hard knock life being compared to that one guy that no one likes.

1881
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,240
It's a hard knock life.

1882
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:07,960
For us.

1883
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,280
That's the only line of that song.

1884
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,240
I don't even know what it is.

1885
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:11,880
A manny?

1886
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:12,920
Pretty sure.

1887
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,760
Um, gross.

1888
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,000
Yeah.

1889
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:16,760
Yep.

1890
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,600
Um, I'm saying.

1891
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,880
Have you ever seen Stuart Little?

1892
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:27,560
Maybe.

1893
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,960
Because I'm getting some hardcore Stuart Little lads from you.

1894
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,360
I might have.

1895
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:31,560
Mouse.

1896
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,200
Mouse in an orphanage.

1897
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,040
Yeah.

1898
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,560
I'm sure you're about to be what I'm done with you.

1899
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,560
No, I'm gonna kill my own mouse pain.

1900
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,280
That's fucking blows.

1901
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,320
Look how close I got it.

1902
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,240
Please whiff it.

1903
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,200
Just whiff it like the coward I am.

1904
01:16:50,200 --> 01:17:05,080
Uh, oh, you, you, if you find out solution, I know that I'm going to find your spirit.

1905
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,360
Wow.

1906
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,200
Uh, what, what should I do?

1907
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,360
No, it's too fucking powerful.

1908
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,080
Just do it.

1909
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:17,640
Just, just.

1910
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,240
Okay.

1911
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,760
And I thought I was going to.

1912
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,320
I, I, I do not think I'm really doing this.

1913
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,600
Look at it.

1914
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,080
It doesn't know.

1915
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,800
It doesn't know you're swinging unless you give it your full power.

1916
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:53,800
Oh, you're catching up.

1917
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:54,680
Okay.

1918
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,880
You're too, you're too behind.

1919
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,800
I can go ahead.

1920
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,440
I can do it.

1921
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:58,760
Okay.

1922
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,440
All right.

1923
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:02,040
All right.

1924
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,280
All right.

1925
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:02,520
All right.

01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:02,600
All right.

1927
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:02,680
All right.

1928
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,680
All right.

1929
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,440
No.

1930
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:18,760
Why?

1931
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,640
I didn't, I was swinging.

1932
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,280
I was going.

1933
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,840
I'm so sorry.

1934
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,840
I'm so sorry that that didn't happen.

1935
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,080
No.

1936
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,560
Then say it here.

1937
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,680
You're here to capitalize on what I've just witnessed.

1938
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,560
I'm not scared that if I fucking slice it too hard, it'll go out of bounds.

1939
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:42,920
No.

1940
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,080
No.

1941
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,280
No, wrong.

1942
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,120

01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,200
Did I lose two strokes because of that?

1950
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:21,360
I think I yeah, you you get a penalty. Oh, but like it moved you to the water. Yeah, so you could theoretically hit it across. Oh

1951
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,940
Wait, no, no, you can't because you're in the rough you're not gonna make it

01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,040
Perfect perfect

2005
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,960

I'm gonna get my certificate of computer a to draft

2013

Except that part's actually true

2014
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,280
No

2015
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,960
No, that would never be the case

2016
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:52,040
Yes, you're gonna get fucking slimed you're gonna get slimmered

2019
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:20,080
No, it's not what I did that's wrong. That's a literally a lie that they lied to me

2020
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,960
They've done it before

2021
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,960
Do it again

2022

This is fucking brutal no one's watching this no, why would they oh

This isn't for you, this is for us we need time off. Yeah, you people this is our vacation. You're treating a pot

2024
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,680
Drive us. Oh

All right, I

2027
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:03,120
Did and I took it down again because I'm a capricious God and I don't cater to my subjects whims

2028
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,240
Oh

2029
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,680
Yes

01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:19,400
Listen, Ben. Don't get sad if your mom dies trying this off unexpectedly

2031

Now that I know

2032
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,080
I should put on my wrist

2033
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,120
Why the slide

2034
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Come on

Okay, okay, excellent, okay as they say in the industry excellent

2038
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,360
Good excellent

2039
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,400
This game is for sadness

2040
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,960
This is a product is a product for and by a sadness. Yeah

2041
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,960
Christian Christian juggalos like us can't can't enjoy this. Oh

2042
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,960
Oh

2043
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,360
Okay, I fucking did it

2044
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,040
Yeah, we're Christian juggalos we're representing the right we're with the right side of history

2045
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
Of course, I

2046
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:37,440
Can't back in a thousand years and everyone's doing I think how how is it ever possible that we were suddenly getting such a way?

2047
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,320
Come on I

2048
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,760
Can't just fucking do it. I can't do a bitch

2049
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:52,880
Yeah, all right, excellent double bow. That was that sure was satisfying. Yeah, that's your felt good

2050
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,480
They said sure match the game I can't the kinesthetic the game feel of this game is out of this world

2051
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,120
this serene

2052
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,600
Atmospheric incredible blissful time represents the

2053
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,600
No

2054
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,760
My hair

2055
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,400
Thank you, but it's true unfortunately

2056
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,920
If you were smart

2057
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,920
No

2058
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,400
If you're smart you quickly you were ahead. Oh, I don't think that's gonna make it off the off the rough

2059
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,240
Yeah, garbage unfortunate

2060
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,680
All right, let me show you a real man plays baseball

2061
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
That's gonna

2062
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,920
Oh

2063
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,920
No, I don't understand my strategy was perfect

2064
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,400
Hey, I

2065
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,040
Don't understand I don't understand what I'm doing wrong as you know

2066
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:26,440
It's as Albert Einstein famously said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result

2067
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:32,480
Learn from history the reason why I'm doing the same thing over and over again because I'm too smart in the game

2068
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,480
It doesn't recognize my fucking genius

2069
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,600
You're you're like your gamma waves. Yeah. Yeah, well, they can't they can't be like tamped down

2070
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,600
It's walking out the fucking Sun

2071
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:51,480
If you go my skull like my gamma waves fucking they're like hotter than plasma. They would obliterate the entire

2072
01:31:52,480 --> 01:32:02,160
Yeah, I'm so fucking distraught right now. Okay, I cannot wait to fucking in this

2073
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:11,000
No, all this is just warm up to get our fucking blood pumping

2074
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,760
So I can fucking be but we can play the only game that actually matters being the share of each other

2075
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,480
All right, all right incredible

2076
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,920
Okay

2077
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:37,040
That's what I want. No, no

2078
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,960
All right, perfect. Oh

2079
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
Disgusting so

2080
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,720
Truly upset

2081
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,800
Truly upset

2082
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,720
Oh

2083
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,840
No, wait, I'm right there

2084
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,040
No

2085
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,520
I've so many feet to go

2086
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,080
Rose

2087
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,480
Oh

2088
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,760
End of the line

2089
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,280
This is we're all good men come back. That's what I wanted to do

2090
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,160
No wrong stop stop all your head

2091
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,600
If only the sad set fucking knew these playing right into my trap

2092
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,640
And only if you knew if you would just stop right now and give me $25 and I would go easy

2093
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
You know

2094
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:10,680
It only had the fucking gumption and courage and wisdom to fucking stop the charade once

2095
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,640
She would know you should close fucking brains out right out of the course

2096
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,600
Oh

2097
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,400
You're so dumb

2098
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,120
Incredible to feed I

2099
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
Told you

2100
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,600
I

2101
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:58,200
Okay, well, it's fair. It's fair. Yeah, this is the last hole. I think so

2102
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:08,240
Okay, no, this is fine, you know that like this this golf has should count for like 90%

2103
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,920
Yeah, yeah, the point. Yeah, oh

2104
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,520
Well, I mean zero. I mean it's more like

2105
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:21,920
Yeah, cuz it literally doesn't do what it's supposed to yeah 100% of the time it can be counted upon

2106
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,440
All right, all right, it's time to time to buckle them up. I want it right in there that sweet spot

2107
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,360
Yeah

2108
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,440
Yes, no

2109
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:45,040
It's time to nut up shut up and pack your bags to fucking hell where you belong

2110
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,840
Okay, I'm I can accept that

2111
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,640
All right fucking

2112
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:58,160
Look at the utter pointlessness of that like zigzag path down the middle. Yeah

2113
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,600
Oh

2114
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,560
No dad

2115
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,680
I don't even know what the bunker is the bungs are I'm gonna take Hitler's body once I'm done with them

2116
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,720
Alive so he can kill himself in the bunker. It's what's what's historically accurate

2117
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
Or so they say

2118
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,600
Am I gonna get a three a whole three well

2119
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,640
How many things like any a new a numerical value and how many things the United States government is lying to us about?

2120
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,800
10 to the power of

2121
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,800
16

2122
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,920
Oh my god

2123
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,160
Nice song, I don't even know what that means

2124
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,120
It means you're a pawn don't even understand what it means you're a sheep

2125
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,440
God damn the most

2126
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,880
I used all my fucking I used all my man. I used all my my my my my BP you exhausted all your spirit energy

2127
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,800
Yeah

2128
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,840
No, then don't even try it. I'm just gonna save us both some time

2129
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
That was par fuck you

2130
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:23,400
All right, all right, this is the final this is it. This is it. This is where this is where this is where boys become men

2131
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:28,280
Become beasts nonsense. This is unacceptable. There's no wind

2132
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,120
Good. There's no wind

2133
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,520
Yeah

2134
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,440
Perfect

2135
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,360
Perfect

2136
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,480
Right in the water

2137
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:50,320
All right, don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. No, no, it's okay. I understand

2138
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,200
Check out this you're not gonna fucking check out this no dude

2139
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,040
This is a mistake

2140
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,640
That's what your parents said last night when they had sex with me

2141
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
This is all a false

2142
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,040
Bounced off the fucking shoreline

2143
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,800
Okay, you'll never get it from the rough. No, no, no, bro

2144
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
Okay

2145
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:19,160
Justin can visualize what I'm about to do to you, okay

2146
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,160
Oh

2147
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,680
Instead it was fake trap behind

2148
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,160
I'm getting getting steamed

2149
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,920
This is the voice of someone who has nothing left to lose

2150
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,960
Except the pride will and wife

2151
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,080
Wish a lot when you think about it. Yeah. Yeah, okay

2152
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
What what?

2153
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
What

2154
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,480
What the fuck what is happening? Where's the ball?

2155
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,880
Uh

2156
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,080
I have to put it I have to put it while it's in the water. No, it was it no

2157
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:31,000
It's looking at where it landed, but it says you're shooting from the edge of the islands. I

2158
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:37,560
Hope my driver is fucking built for hydraulics

2159
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,600
All right, all right, this is gonna decide my fucking whether my life my wife leaves me or not

2160
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,680
So that's hope that I lose

2161
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:56,200
Well, no, I was in the water you were you were in the fucking water. I you were in the water

2162
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,480
Okay, okay, it's fucking figured out now

2163
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, you got wrong. No, you got wrong

2164
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,080
You're playing a dangerous game on she it's called

2165
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,880
All right

2166
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
All right, I figured it out

2167
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,840
Yeah, I just have to shoot myself and then I'll win

2168
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,560
No, that's wrong

2169
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:49,080
With that then I'm clean with you recognize your own intelligence and your decision making a

2170
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,400
Building recognized when you're out of your league so far

2236
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,080

Come on, come on.

2240
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,080
Only I get to kill cops in this neighborhood.

2241
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,080
Only I believe in reverse police brutality.

2242
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:20,080
Reverse police brutality wins!

2243
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,080
Hey, oh, yeah, hey, oh, yeah.

2244
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,080

2245
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,080
Your furl's gonna have rained it

2246
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,080
because I'm gonna do a fucking rain dance

2247
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,080
because I'm Native American.

2248
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,080
You won with a fucking Kroxma.

2249
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,080
I did.

2250
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,080
I fucking win.

2251
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,080
Look well and look hard and listen big

2252
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,080
and listen small.

2253
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,080
Fucking munchie is the only rowdy fucker

2254
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,080
and the only cop color there fucking is.

2255
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,080
But I...

2256
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:48,080
But I worked so hard to get my golf.

2257
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,080
Golf doesn't matter when you have hands.

2258
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:54,080
Golf doesn't matter when you use your hands

2259
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,080
in the ancient Greco-Roman tradition

2260
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,080
of being a fucking meanie.

2261
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,080
Well, we beat we sport.

2262
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,080
We did it.

2263
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,080
100% we're on we sports.

2264
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,080
Perfect game.

2265
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,080
We saw all the content.

2266
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,080
S ranks, speed runs.

2267
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,080
Do you think it's a single game

2268
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
more competitively viable

2269
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,080
in an e-sports environment than in e-sports?

2270
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,080
Hopscotch.

2271
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,080
And tic-tac-toe.

2272
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,080
I'll have to give you that.

2273
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,080
Next time on...

2274
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2275
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:28,080
Chris wants to see tic-tac-toe and hopscotch.

2276
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,080
In that order.

2277
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,080
You probably might win hopscotch.

2278
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,080
But I'm a master at tic-tac-toe.

2279
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,080
Wait, listen to these fucking funky jams.

2280
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,080
Yeah, I know.

2281
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,080
Alright, in the video.

2282
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,080
See you later, losers.
