00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Hello there and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:16,560
my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today we are drinking Citizen Cider Unified

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,760
Press Traditional Semi-Sweet Apple Cider. This is made locally in Vermont which is pretty

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,680
close to where I am here in MassachusettsCitizenCider.com. It's pretty good. I've had a few cans

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,480
of it so far. I'm a big fan of hard cider in general. The reason I bought this actually

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
wasn't because I was in the mood for cider or anything. It was because the graphic design

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,160
on the can is really nice. Really good type setting. Yeah, that's what happens when you

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,000
go to school for graphic design kids. That's where your purchase influences come from. Good

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,080
typography gets you a purchase from me. So yeah, not too sweet, just enough tart to be

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:14,080
pleasant. Good interaction with the palate. I like it. I like it a lot. CitizenCider.com.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,320
If you would like to donate to the Wine Fund and suggest a wine to drink on the show, as

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,280
well as a topic to bitch about on the wine chamber, there's a link in the description

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,240
to my paypal. I'll also link to my coffee, which is a new thing I have now. So if you

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,600
want to buy me a coffee, buy me a drink, you can do that as well. They both have a note

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,760
feature so you can drop in what I should look for and what I should talk about. Now, before

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,000
we go any further, I wanted to make a quick mention because someone a couple months ago

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,100
sent me a wine suggestion and a topic suggestion and I'm not doing them right now. The reason

18
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,540
for that is I don't know if the payment got declined or it was cancelled or something,

19
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,420
it's weird. So I'm not going to use any names, but the guy said to get some passion

20
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,820
pump and if not, just get some box wine and wanted to complain about Windows updates,

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,880
which actually I could say a lot about because I had a bunch of problems with Windows updates,

22
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,060
but the status is money received cancelled. So I don't know if it never went through,

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,220
the payment never went through or like paypal did something or it's just like you've taken

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,660
like 3 months to get to my wine chamber topic, I'm taking my money back, totally understandable,

25
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,940
but just wanted to throw that out there. You know who you are if you're listening to this.

26
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,100
There was a weird issue with that and that's why I haven't gotten the passion pop. Also

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,220
the joke of the show is that it's called the wine chamber and I drink everything but wine.

28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,380
So I'm more than willing to sell myself out and kill the joke entirely for money, but

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm just letting you know that that's kind of the gist of the show is that it's a play

30
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,260
on words with wine because I'm whining while drinking not wine. There you go. I've explained

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,100
the joke, it's no longer a joke, so I guess I can do whatever I want now. But today on

32
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,740
the wine chamber, we're drinking Citizen Cider and we're talking about, I really didn't have

33
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,420
a good way of phrasing this like snappy, maybe I've come up with something better by the

34
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,340
time this goes up and I have a title for this episode, but for now it's going to be diametrically

35
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:15,300
opposed advice that is convincing on both sides. So I don't know a snappy way to put

36
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,540
that yet, I'm going to workshop it a bit between now and when this gets posted. But the idea

37
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:29,140
basically is that when we're growing up, we learn things and usually as we grow up, we

38
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,780
kind of internalize the building blocks of like how to actually function in society and

39
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,340
be a semi competent human being and kind of build the baseline skills you need to be actually

40
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,340
functional. There's usually a pretty straightforward path on how to do that. You know, and if

41
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,460
someone tries to deviate you from the path, once you have some general context, it's pretty

42
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,900
self evident that deviating from the path is a bad idea. Let's say you're a little kid

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,740
and your parents tell you, don't touch the stove, it'll burn you. I'm not going to touch

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,260
the stove. If someone then comes along and says, Hey, touch the stove, it builds character.

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,700
Not a very convincing argument. You really don't want to scald your hands. You're going

46
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,220
to be like, No, I'm good on that, dude. Not going to touch the stove. And if you do, you're

47
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,620
going to learn pretty quickly that advice kind of sucked. Like the character doesn't help

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,980
your hand heal over the next like two or three weeks. Simple example, but you get the general

49
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,220
idea. There's like a very linear sort of singular progression to building the basic building

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,860
blocks you need in order to be a functional human being. But at some point around adolescence,

51
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,500
things start to get kind of convoluted. Multiple paths open up, you can spec into different

52
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,060
options as you were. If you want to get some lead gamer terms in here, right, you can go

53
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,820
in different directions. And that's where things start to get a little bit murky. You

54
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,680
get to specialize, you know, your hobbies, your education, your, your dreams and ambitions

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,340
in life. There's tons of different options. I think it gets even worse though, when you're

56
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,700
done with education, because when you're when you're educating yourself and you're going

57
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,020
through the high school system, the college system, the trades school, anything like that,

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,220
there is an underlying structure, right? That's why you're paying money, you're putting the

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,020
time and that's why the accreditation you earn has merit because there is some sort

60
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,220
of underlying structure that you're working within and the people outside judging you based

61
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,740
on your your acquisition of your diploma or scale or whatever, they know that you were

62
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,100
able to function within the boundaries of those constraints and perform accordingly.

63
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,020
That's kind of where the value of a degree or whatever comes from. But when you try and

64
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,260
decide your life after that when you try and make more abstract decisions, lots of people

65
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:36,260
offer tons of conflicting advice that all seem basically as good and as relevant as

66
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,780
the next one and they all make compelling arguments. And now it's up to you, someone who has been

67
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,900
on a single trajectory, for the most part, a very structured way of learning a very structured

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,540
way of progressing your life and acquiring new skills to discern with no kind of guidance

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,380
whatsoever on how the best way is to operate your life. And perhaps this is just me as

70
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,820
someone who is like cursed with analysis paralysis constantly overthinking everything. But the

71
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,700
more I try and learn about how I should function as a human being and how I want to function

72
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,220
as a human being the skills I want to acquire the ways I want to live my life the values

73
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,580
I want to uphold. There are tons of conflicting information out there. And none of them seem

74
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,980
less compelling than the next they all make good cases. And it's up to me to try and figure

75
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,340
out which way I want to go and the only way to really kind of come to a proper conclusion

76
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,860
it seems is trial and error. And that's a pain in the ass. Let me give you an example.

77
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,860
This is probably the most relevant example to me personally in my life that continually

78
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,340
comes up in some way or another because it's a broad subject that can be attacked from different

79
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,740
angles but it really boils down to the same thing. Ambition versus complacency. And that

80
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,300
sounds much more derogatory really when I say it that way than what I mean. To kind

81
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,180
of delve into it a bit more. I am the kind of person that reads self help books. I know

82
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,540
it's kind of sad but that's just kind of where I am in my life and I like reading books

83
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,220
and like listening to audiobooks and that stuff mostly because I have an audible account

84
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,780
and I can't stand listening to fiction in audiobooks. But also because there's a lot

85
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,740
of interesting people. Usually what happens is I'll find someone on YouTube just kind

86
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,740
of browsing YouTube and I get a suggestion and I like find a person who seems really

87
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,460
interesting as a speaker like Gary Vaynerchuk is a good example. And so I read his book

88
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,340
and I bought his book and I'm like oh this is cool. So that's kind of how I find a lot

89
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,620
of these audiobooks that I end up purchasing because I have like these tokens every month

90
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,660
and I'm like what the fuck else am I going to do with it. I'm not going to listen to

91
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,820
Lord of the Rings and have some weird British guy try and voice you know every character.

92
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,220
But I digress. The self help books kind of there's two different schools. There's kind

93
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,020
of like the western business self help of like pulling you up yourself up by your bootstraps

94
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,420
and like attacking everything head on create big goals always be striving to grow more

95
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,420
more more be the biggest best you can be figure out what your goal is and then make it a hundred

96
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,180
times bigger and go for that. There's that one aspect of like constant self improvement

97
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,540
constant growth and constant just like expanding of your abilities and never being satisfied

98
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,540
with where you are. And then on the other hand you have the minimalist kind of Zen I don't

99
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,260
want to say Eastern but I kind of like the Buddhist kind of more like calm Zen mentality

100
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,660
of just like you know get your shit sorted. Understand that nothing is as important as

101
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,060
it's all being told to you to be and kind of try and find some inner tranquility imbalance

102
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,460
carve out a small little niche for yourself. Master that and then learn to be complacent

103
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,620
and maybe I'm complacent but satisfied. It's really being hungry for more versus being

104
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,180
grateful for what you already have and both sides of this equation make really good arguments

105
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,740
right because on the one hand this kind of like growth mentality is avoiding stagnation

106
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,500
and it's about not letting any of your potential go to waste. It's realizing that the human

107
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,140
potential in everybody is massive and you just have to learn to tap into it and be comfortable

108
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,620
going to places you haven't been before being vulnerable and weak and unskilled and powering

109
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,100
through that to reach new heights. And I guess as someone who's entrepreneurially minded

110
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,300
and why I'm doing all the YouTube stuff like I want to tap into that more because I feel

111
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,500
like that's definitely something that's holding me back from getting to a Digibro level of

112
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,140
a success is like really focusing like picking one skill and hammering away that hardcore

113
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,740
over and over and over again and not accepting anything less than the best that I can do

114
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,540
and beyond that and really planning huge and going far beyond anything I've never attempted

115
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,140
to do before and really push hard on that. But on the other hand you know the gratitude

116
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:51,320
mentality would say that that mentality is dangerous because you're never satisfied.

117
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Even when you accomplish your goals it's short lived and you're just going to keep chasing

118
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,680
the next high for the rest of your life and you'll be chasing these empty accomplishments

119
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,680
where if you come at it from an angle of gratitude you can be thankful for what you have. And when

120
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,520
you grow it's always on top of a stable base like the growth isn't to give your life meaning

121
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,560
it's just something on top of meaning you've already derived from something internal. But

122
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,120
the downside to that is that you're limiting your potential because you're not working

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,000
as hard you might have more inner peace you might have more like mental tranquility but

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,680
you're inevitably not going to push yourself as hard or go as far as you would if you were

125
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,240
hungry. So it's this kind of mentality I've always struggled with because because I've

126
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,840
been raised in like a Western culture you know in America the first method of like constant

127
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,720
growth and the hunger mentality dominates our culture it's everything in America is bigger

128
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,040
better faster stronger all that shit. So that's the kind of mentality that I've always adopted

129
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,400
and I definitely feel like because of my like mental deficiencies you know my clinical depression

130
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,520
and things like that it makes it very difficult to achieve that because you need to be confident

131
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,460
in yourself you need to be able to take hits and keep going and because I'm just very mentally

132
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,040
up unstable being able to power through things like that is very difficult and that leads

133
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,400
to a lot of my problems that I've had in the last couple years trying to make it as a content

134
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,440
creator. So the allure of trying to like go inward and find this gratitude and this inner

135
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,600
peace of this other sort of mentality is very appealing but I just feel that it would it

136
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,760
would be counterintuitive to what I want to achieve long term I want to be big and this

137
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,600
is the thing like even my idea of being big is like I'd like 100,000 subscribers or something

138
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,440
like that an audience big enough to sustain me financially so I can do what I want to

139
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,260
do but the the growth minded mentality would say that that's thinking too small I need

140
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,340
to be like the biggest youtuber of all time I gotta make millions of dollars I gotta grow

141
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,860
bigger bigger bigger and like I gotta take my 100,000 no no times about 100 you need

142
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,620
10 million 100 million like that's what you need to shoot for and it's just this like

143
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,180
I don't want to say greed but you're tap dancing on the line between ambition and greed by going

144
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,860
for this hardcore and it really needs you to have an ego and I definitely don't have

145
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,980
one so this is just one example but there's tons of other examples in life of like arguments

146
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,460
being made that both seem equally cogent and it really comes down to personal preference

147
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,580
and the problem is when you're somebody who's looking for answers which is how you're going

148
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,340
to run into all these kind of things in the first place you are looking for answers so

149
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,380
when you're presented with multiple choices you're not really in the mindset of like trying

150
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,940
to sift through all these things you're looking for someone to tell you what you need to do

151
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,020
because the whole problem is you don't know what to do so when you're presented with multiple

152
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,380
options that seem good you're kind of just giving yourself a new set of problems as

153
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,460
opposed to finding the solution you were looking for so this is something that's always bothered

154
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,420
me because I'm I have a pension already to be analysis paralysis of just like being overloaded

155
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,740
by choice and they're not making any choice I'm very susceptible to falling into this

156
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,980
trap of being like this is a good idea but this is a good idea but this is a good idea

157
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,660
too so which idea do I want to do and it seems like the only thing I can do is just play musical

158
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,260
chairs with them essentially and keep trying one out and seeing if it works for me or not

159
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,820
but even then like I'm always trying to look for the objective truth and it's arguable

160
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,500
that there is no objective truth but I think in the confines of our reality I think there

161
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,140
are definitely choices that have more merit than others like even if I said you know what

162
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm just going to be a gratitude minded like in the back of my head I'm always going to

163
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,860
be like but you could be doing better you could be doing more you could be bigger and vice versa

164
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,940
the other way like if I'm constantly hungry and keep climbing the ladder I'm just like

165
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,420
you could just calm down you know you could take a moment and just kind of like clear

166
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,100
your head a little bit and not be so voracious all the time like just chill so I don't know

167
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,060
that's that's really all I want to say is a short episode but that's what I'm bitching

168
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:06,380
about is that I just I wish things were simpler I wish maybe if things can't be simpler I wish

169
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:13,340
we were given more tools growing up to face things like this there because in our inner

170
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,820
education system it feels like to be at least in my experience is that it's very much one answer

171
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,700
you know they give you the answer they prep you for that answer and there's there's a linear

172
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,900
progression in learning things and you know especially in school there's never multiple ways

173
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,980
of doing things it's always like this is the one way regurgitate what we've told you you can't

174
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,580
really come to differing conclusions for the most part and college sometimes you can but even then

175
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,700
it depends on who's teaching the material so in light of not being able to simplify a complicated

176
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,140
world I wish we were better prepared to make complicated choices at least me so that's all

177
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,620
I got for this episode of the hyperbolic wine chamber it's good to be back check the links

178
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,900
below if you want to donate to the wine fund if you want to support me and all my other content

179
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,860
in the long term you go to patreon.com slash save me a dollar a month gets you a bunch of extra

180
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,260
stuff including cool art things and you can rant at me about how dumb I am or whatever so until

181
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,500
next time Tom Oliver this has been the hyperbolic wine chamber have a good one
