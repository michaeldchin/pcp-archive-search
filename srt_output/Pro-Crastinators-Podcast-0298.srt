00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Take a deep breath. Come on, Ben. You can do this. You have the fortitude. You have the emotional stability to make it through another one of these solo Ben casts. You can do it, buddy. Okay, don't let him hear you cry.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello, it is me, the baby boy. I have a question for Ben Saint. Will you abort me? I am only two years old. My brain is not fully developed. A chimpanzee can outthink me. Put me in a blender.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You know you need to. Put the baby in a blender. Put the baby in a blender.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All by my lonesome. In like a cool way. Gibb, well, you know, I guess she didn't say she was coming. I said PCP in 15 minutes and she said she it.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Which seems like confirmation to me. I waited for a while and we're pretty much, we're past the time, the starting time, so I'm going.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Anyway, that's the story. So how are you all doing? I'm doing okay. I feel okay this morning, this Sunday, January 23rd. I felt very angry yesterday. Well, I felt very annoyed yesterday and the day before.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I had an annoyed weekend, but whatever. I'm good now and it's time and I'm going to get back into, all right, this brings me, so what I'm going to do now that I'm feeling rational again.

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh my God, Gibb. I was just about to launch into the first of my topics, but what's up?

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I was like, oh shit, PCP in 15 minutes. My mind wandered. I don't even know what happened. I find myself looking at a video of an orangutan driving a golf cart and I look over and I'm like, wait, oh shit.

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The procrastinators podcast is recording.

11
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know what? That it could happen to anybody. Tail as old as time.

12
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a good video.

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sure it was he flanged? Was he flanged?

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't think he's flanged. I think he's big. He's a big boy, big fat boy.

15
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What good is it?

16
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
An orangutan is nothing if he don't have a flange orangy hold that flange.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
New theme song? Okay. No, maybe. I don't know. Vote in the comments.

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't even know what happened. I just got out in the shower when it was like PCP in 15. I was like, oh shit.

19
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I guess I looked at videos for a while.

20
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I guess you did. It's okay.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, my brain's so small.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Uh-oh, COVID brain fog.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, no, I need that COVID. I need that COVID to speed up my neurons, to shrink my brain.

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, your brain's too big. You're saying you're in desperate need of some shrinkage.

25
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To this day, I have not gotten COVID. It's my one floor.

26
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're living in the past. We're living in a post-COVID, efficient brain world.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're in that old big brain modality.

28
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's true.

29
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, when things shrink and wither up, like a prune, they get wrinklier. Your brain gets wrinklier too.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your brain is the same.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Uh, sure.

32
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Obviously.

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Um, yeah.

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Other than that, how's your week? How was your week this week?

35
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Uh, my week is good. I think, yes, it is good.

36
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I purchased envelopes and boxes.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I also purchased envelopes.

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, I have everything with me.

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Um, I can't remember where I was, what state things were at.

40
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think I had the stuff last week, but I'm ready to ship it in the next few days.

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm ready to ship a bunch of the stuff.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, you're going to ship the book, the pen, the red man, side zine, and the plush also?

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Um, or the plush later.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Plush later. I still need to, to like make, I have fabric.

46
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I just need to make the little Lord of Ghost costumes.

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right, right.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So those will take a little longer, but hey.

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Make sense to me.

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to get like the, the labels sent to me and I'm going to stick them on.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm going to fucking, they're going to be posted.

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A bunch of them, not all of them, but a bunch of them.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No.

56
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's great.

57
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No fucking way.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Uh, cool.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Uh, I can, again, I cannot wait to have mine.

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Um, I, um, I should really, okay, I always meant to do this and I, and I guess I still could and I probably still should.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's no reason.

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I never showed off my copy of the, of the Kato anthology.

63
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I never like tweeted with a picture of the Kato anthology.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think, or did, or did I, I don't think I did.

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Um, and, and same with, um, yeah, the Kato anthology.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have that and I never showed it.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Um, and also, uh, the latest, uh, villain verse cheeses, the last, the last villain verse chapter that he, you know, uh, published.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Uh, I have that and I never showed that off.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And the most recent addition to thing that I got that I should show off and I haven't is, um, I got a, I haven't opened, even opened it yet, but I got like card and like some pins.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A Tyler from Animorph in Time made some, like exclusive Animorph in Time pins that, uh, were just for, for people that guessed it on the show, uh, which is pretty cool.

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So I have that in a package here.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I haven't even seen it yet, but I've, I've seen what they look like.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They look really good.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They look like the Animorphs logo.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They're shiny gold.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Uh, like, I want to show those off.

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Uh, and I will put, I'll be sure to put your Lord of Ghost stuff on the pile of things that I mean to show off and never do.

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You should, you should do your, you should do like a, an unboxing video.

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Make a series of it.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Look, look what I got on my, my gamer wall on my, on my things that you see and are impressed by.

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I love the gamer wall.

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I love, I put anything, I, anything I like, I put on the gamer wall.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Um, I, uh, uh, oh shit, I was going to say something.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh yeah.

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I, I also, I got envelopes or I ordered envelopes because I'm out of the right size envelopes for the, the plebe and we blue rays.

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think I sold like 80 of them or 70 something of them and I ran out of envelopes.

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So I had to, I have like, I think I have, so I went, I went to the post office, but I got there like too late because they, for the international shipping, they gave me, like I had to, even though I had the address on the envelopes, they gave me slips that I had to, for each international one, I had to fill out all the address info again.

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Uh, and that took me a while.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then by the time I got back in line, it was late enough that the guy was like, it took them for, it takes them forever.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have to like enter all the fucking information by hand.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Like I had to write the shit on the envelope.

92
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then I had to copy the shit onto a slip.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then I had to show them the slip and they had to manually enter the address info.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Like why, why do I, why do I not just show them, why not just show them the envelope?

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know, whatever.

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Uh, so it got so late in the day that they were like, I can't do anymore today.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We've got, I've got to finish up taking people in the line.

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I, I, I didn't get to send all of the international ones.

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I have like, and then I got a few more new orders.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I think I have like 20 here that I still have to send out.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Um, and I, and then there's like 10 more that don't have an envelope because I ran out and I need to, those are in the mail.

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I ordered them from envelopes.com.

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It'd be a beautiful service.

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't recommend envelopes.com enough.

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Uh, and they've, they've started arriving.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Uh, Roro Chan showed, tweeted a picture of one plebe and wee blu-ray in the wild,

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
uh, sitting in his slime light with his monster energy cans.

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh, it looks great.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Uh, that's very exciting.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I hope I see a lot more of those.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's cool that it exists.

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I kind of imagine like watching it though, at this point.

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, you know, uh, I, I kind of agree, but I actually disagree about, uh, um,

114
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
well, there's two things that I think make the plebe and the weeb stuff that people would actually, would, would actually want.

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think the Radcon, the documentary, like, I don't think that was like published anywhere.

116
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right?

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, I don't remember.

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't think I've ever seen like the final cut of that.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think it was Victor filming it.

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was like, I don't want to say the...

121
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think he, I think it was only, um, uh, it was, it was only shown to backers in like a Google Drive folder,

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and it was, and it was gonna be on the Blu-rays, but then, you know, the Blu-rays were never made.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But it's on, it's on the Vs, because Tectonic Improv shared the bonus, uh, content with me.

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So, uh, Radcon 2, it's, it's just called Radcon the documentary, but it's about Radcon 2, and it's like, it's like a 45 minute,

125
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
like, interviews, and like, behind the scenes stuff, and like, it's really well shot and edited and stuff.

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Uh, I think Victor edited it, too.

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And it's good, like, it's cool.

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's real.

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like, the, like, the procrastinators was like something worth filming properly.

131
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Uh, things looked different back then.

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's, it, yeah, I remember it being like, oh, this is like the beginning of a, of an amazing something or other.

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know what it is.

134
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right.

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like, oh, collaborative creative minds.

136
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, it was.

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, we went on to have two very successful Radcons after that.

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, Radcon 4 is not technically successful yet, but, um, it is, it is slowly.

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, yeah, it was like good at the time.

140
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It was just sort of like.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I know it.

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, I know.

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know.

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I know.

147
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
At least I'm still creative.

148
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's true.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm still smart.

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
True.

151
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
True.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Um, oh, you're still, you're still smart.

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're still smart, little creative type, aren't you?

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, don't, it does weird when you say it to me.

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Creating a little content for the internet, aren't you?

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, look at her.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Post a little tweet.

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, I'm posting, I'm posting my fucking comic to people.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
True.

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Uh, um, what else is it going to say?

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And of course, you know, the thing, the thing that no imitator can possibly, uh, uh, duplicate.

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course, the most, the choices and most exclusive of the bonus content is, of course,

163
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the message from Ben St.

164
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Uh, uh, available only on Ben St's plebe and weeb, blue rays, uh, except, except no imitations.

165
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The message, and of course the, uh, the box art and stuff.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's a, there's a, the, the, the message from Ben St is on there.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's the watermark.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's just the seal of quality.

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So you know.

170
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's Ben St in, in the, uh, in the, in the, what is that thing called?

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like the lion that roars before a movie.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, the MGM.

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
MGM, but like it's you going rare or something.

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm vaping and.

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I haven't, I haven't vaped in a while, but it's still funny.

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's, it's integral to your brand, to your, to your, uh, for it.

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I felt when I stopped, when I realized that I had not vaped in a long, long time,

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was like, Oh no, my, my brand.

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Um, it's okay.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't even have the pink hair anymore.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What happened?

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't have the pink hair anymore.

183
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't have the pink hair and I lost my pronouns.

184
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So like, what am I?

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Nothing.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The fur to Ben so easily forgotten.

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Um, and, um,

189
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was going to say, did you?

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you see before we move on from the, that's all I have really have to say about the blue

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
was except buy one, uh, uh, Twitter DM me or discord DM me, uh, info down below, uh,

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
buy more blue rays.

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Um, um, uh, wait.

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh shit.

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh no.

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I should set up a storefront.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I should really set up like an actual storefront.

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There's probably people who would buy one, but they're just a little bit like uneasy with

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the idea of just like sending money through PayPal and then like just like, you know,

202
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
there's probably people who that is like an ask.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I should set up some kind of storefront.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't really know how to do it.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Um, there's got to be a service for that.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Right.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There's got to be some website that you can just create buttons.

208
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Uh, a service.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I guess I'm trying to think.

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's surely it would be quite easy to just set up like a PayPal button on your own website.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Um, some sort of a thing like that because you already have a website.

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I guess it's not about Trixie blue rays, but there probably is a way.

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think you can create like a custom invoice.

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Maybe there's a way to like create a, maybe there's a way to make a button that has like

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
a pre-assigned amount.

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Uh, people sell things on there.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like making websites for like business is like a huge thing.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sure of course there are tutorials for all that.

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Uh, yeah, I just thought I could make like an Etsy account.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I could sell, I could sell my shit through Etsy.

221
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It seems like that's what most people do that like have stuff that they made that they're

223
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
selling themselves.

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'd like to cut out the middleman, but whatever.

225
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uh, this is Ben St. from the future from about 10, about 10 hours into the future, 12 hours

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
into the future when I recorded this.

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I just, I just went ahead and did that.

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I made the storefront.

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Uh, you can buy the Pleven that We Blue Rays and Road to Radcon, the book on there right now.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Uh, it is stcomics.com slash store.html.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Um, it was, um, seems like something I probably should have done before.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It wasn't even that hard.

233
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Actually, I just, I looked into, I had looked for how to like make a buy something button

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
on PayPal before and I just hadn't found it.

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This time I looked again and it was just right there.

236
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was like, oh, okay.

237
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So it wasn't even hard.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Uh, yes, stcomics.com slash store.store.html.

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Link in the description if you need it, I guess.

240
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Uh, for, right, Pleven with Blue Rays and Road to Radcon.

241
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I will, I might add other stuff to there in the future, but, but for now that's what's there.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Uh, uh, yeah.

243
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Okay, back to the, back to the podcast.

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Um, but before we move on from the topic of the Blue Rays.

245
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Did you see that, did you see that Trixie says she's, she's making them?

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Uh, no.

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I saw you talking about a video she made.

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I haven't seen it.

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I, I envy you.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I envy you.

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, there was a, there was a video, uh, which really annoyed me for many reasons.

252
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
One notable thing in it that stuck out is that she does offhandedly mention that she's,

253
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that she's, that she's, all of a sudden she's making the Blue Rays.

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then in the chat, she said, like, yes, I'm making the Blue Rays.

255
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm burning them right now.

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Very weird.

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Very weird thing to do.

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Like, I'm burning them right now.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Like, like she had a Blue Ray burner or she hardly purchased one.

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, I mean, she told Dis send her a Blue Ray burner, which we never found out what happened to.

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Um, I, but like, if she did, if she didn't have like the Blue Ray discs, or maybe she did.

264
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:23,000
She had, um, well in the, you know, I was, in the, like Kickstarter update video, she did show a box of Blue Ray cases.

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I'm not sure if they had discs in them, but that was like, that was like six years ago, or five years ago.

266
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So like, I'd be shocked if she still had those.

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That she would have got rid of them when she sold like all of her stuff.

269
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah.

270
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In that yard sale.

271
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So it's like, if she had the materials there the whole time, like she's telling the truth that she's burning them.

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah.

273
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And she had the materials there, then that's like terrible.

274
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's very weird.

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I mean, I mean, it's terrible no matter what.

276
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It sucks no matter what.

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's terrible no matter what.

278
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's like, I don't know.

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's very, I was very like, what?

280
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
To see that like, first of all, why?

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Like, why, what's even the point?

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like, what's even the point now that I have literally fulfilled the demand?

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Like, what is the point of being like, Oh, well now I'll do it.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, do you, like, do you think it makes you look better or something?

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Of course not.

286
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
All right.

287
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't get it.

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't get it.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What I want to think of is that there was supposed to be like commentary tracks that she would do.

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Commentary tracks.

291
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I remember looking at like the original Kickstarter and be like, Oh, there'll be commentary from Jesse and myself and all that about like the plebe and the weeb.

292
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I don't know whether those exist.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know whether she ever recorded them.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That would be the only thing.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Wait, like commentary tracks for the episodes?

296
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

297
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hmm.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, okay.

299
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't even remember any mention of those, but maybe.

300
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think they were on that.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Imagine her trying to record that with like Bird.

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Imagine what that would be like to listen to.

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Like trying to go back and make that happen.

304
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Bird would have no interest whatsoever.

305
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No.

306
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Of course not.

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know.

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, maybe.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But just, I was very baffled.

310
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was very baffled to see her say that.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And I thought about it.

312
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I think, in my opinion, the most likely scenario, and there was a time when I wouldn't have thought this, but like, remember the RV, like she just she just told a bunch of lies about the RV about like having it and like going to get it and stuff.

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Totally going to do it.

314
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So I think the most like scenario is that she's just lying.

315
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
She's not actually doing it.

316
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
She's just saying she is.

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If she, if on the off chance she is doing it, I can't wait.

319
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I actually hope she is because it would be really funny to compare mine against hers because mine will obviously be better because like I put, I put actual effort into them and they made them look nice.

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And hers are going to be hers are going to be.

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, it's they won't have a label printed on the on the disc.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They might not even have like, like a case art or anything.

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If they do, they'll have like, like mint, mint salad shit.

324
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Imagine, imagine having like mint salad art on the cover of your plebeian wee blu-ray.

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It would be if they if two exist, it would be pretty funny to have one of each if you were a backer to have one of each.

326
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Jess in my server said that if Trixie makes them, she is going to do a side by side like review and comparison of the two versions, which would be really a treat.

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So, yeah, so that's the so that was up with that monitoring the situation very carefully.

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That video was really irritating.

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:04,000
For one, because it's like it's it's yet another video where she just sits there and explains her whole life story and expects you to come away with it like, oh, I get it.

330
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I do like I do like void gazers now. Oh, I like I like the direction of the channel now.

331
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like that explains everything.

332
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, this clears up all my misconceptions about thinking that the channel sucks.

333
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No, it's good, actually, for some reason.

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
She sits there and explains that she tells she tells a bunch of like outright lies in it.

335
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like she she she doubles down on the on the story that like Digibro was just a character she was playing.

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Not not true. Simply false.

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I know I lived with her. I know there was no there was no like, I mean, I mean, it's ridiculous on the face of it.

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Like it's obvious if you think about it for even a second that it was not a character.

339
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
She like recorded herself saying off the cuff stuff she talked about her real opinions.

340
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Obviously, it's not a character.

341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know how you can even say that, but she really does.

342
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
She really says it and expects people to believe it.

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I mean, it's it's weird because like even if it was a character, the character did bad things and stole money from people by not doing stuff that the character said they would do.

344
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's a shitty character.

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And if you like money, it's like, I don't know, but it's not a character. It's just not it's just it just never was it.

346
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And like if you if you if you were even paying attention, it should be obvious to you.

347
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And yet and yet and yet the comments are all like fawning.

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The comments are all like, oh, you've grown so much.

349
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, I'm so happy you made this video.

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, like I like I love to see whatever this is.

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Like, oh, I support you so much.

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Like you're right.

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, OK, OK.

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The thing the thing that like the thesis of the video is like, you know, my new content is because I'm happy now.

355
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And people only don't like my new they only want my old style of content because I was miserable.

356
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
They all want me to be miserable so they can relate to me.

357
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's like a weird like cope like humble brag like you're like you the audience are just miserable and you just want me to be miserable like you.

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So you can relate to me, but I'm happy now.

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So if you don't like my new style of content, it just means you're like abusive and you hate me and you want me to suffer.

360
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And that's fucked up.

361
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know.

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Just just really annoying to hear.

363
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean, like a deranged person say this stuff and like more deranged people in the comments be like, yes.

364
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's the same old shit.

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It is the same.

366
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I felt like it was like, oh, shit, the new Trixie video, people talking about it.

367
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And maybe saying it was like that sounds like everything she does.

368
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's no reason.

369
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's so like whatever.

370
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's weird.

371
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's just it's it's weird to have people being so emphatic about like how like important it was to them to hear this in the comments.

372
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But like if they'd been paying attention at all, if they were invested at all, they would have heard it already because she said it over and over and over again.

373
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Like they simply must not care.

374
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And yet they're there in the comments to be like, I just shaking and crying, shaking and crying, listening, listening to you say that Ben St.

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Ben St. is a holy warrior defending the people from all from me who who stole their money and didn't deliver on stuff.

376
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Direct quote.

377
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Direct quote from that clip.

378
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That was great.

379
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It was weird out of context.

380
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It seems like she wasn't even saying it as a bad thing about you.

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Um, I mean, it's funny.

382
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
She said she says it in a way that like it's supposed to be like derisive.

383
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Like, huh, they're acting like he's they're acting like he's like some kind of holy warrior.

384
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They're acting like he's like doing something good just because he's, you know, protecting people from the fact that I stole money from them.

385
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
She says it like dismissively, but then doesn't doesn't elaborate on like why that's not true.

386
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There's no like there's no like, but there's no but after it.

387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's that parasocial relationship thing.

388
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

389
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's always been that like they they view.

390
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean, whether or not like people believe the character, they view internet people.

391
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Everybody does to a certain extent.

392
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If you don't know a person and you watch their content, you see them as like an internet character and the internet is the show you're watching.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And drama they have is like like is drama for a TV show.

394
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And it's like, whoa, interesting.

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And a character that has like hit rock bottom.

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And it's like says, I've learned from my mistakes.

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, cool.

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah.

399
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They're getting their redemption arc.

400
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah.

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
People love redemption.

402
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And they forget that it's a real person and they may never actually do anything good.

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
They just like the idea of it.

404
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And they see it in themselves like, well, if this character of this TV show called the internet can have a bad moment and get out of it and feel happy, then maybe I can do that as well.

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, Digi, you're so smart and I love you and here's money.

406
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

407
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah.

408
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's embarrassing.

409
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm Jen.

410
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm Jen.

411
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I feel sorry.

412
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I feel sorry for people in the comments like falling for it.

413
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like I know more than them and I know that they're like just wrong and being duped.

414
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay, whatever.

415
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh wait, I was going to say one more thing about that.

416
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, oh, she says, she says that like when she's in the part that she's talking about me.

417
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She says that she doesn't know like why I don't like her.

418
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
She says that like, okay, there was the Brony lecture and Ben was mad that I didn't release the Brony lecture.

419
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And then, and then she gets like confused and then she's like, I don't know.

420
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't know what happened.

421
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't know why it went from Ben being mad about the Brony lecture to whatever she said.

422
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
However, I forget how she describes the current situation, but like she says, she doesn't know how it progressed.

423
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And like she has to be lying because like she must remember.

424
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean, there's more, there's more stuff that she probably doesn't remember or doesn't understand what she did wrong.

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I could imagine that like she has to remember at least the argument in the PCP where she had a fucking freak out and rage quit because I said that like Yig is bad and Riley is bad.

426
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So she has to know.

427
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I could imagine it's it's like if somebody is attacking her and she defends herself.

428
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Right.

429
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Then that was her being correct because she was defending herself.

430
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Sure.

431
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And it doesn't matter how she does that defending or what she does in the defense of herself because she's always right.

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And then, you know, like she doesn't understand why Ben St would say all these mean things and force her to leave the PCP.

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah.

434
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
She didn't do anything.

435
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
She was just being the best person ever.

436
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was the only way it was there.

437
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Sure.

438
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Her hand was forced.

439
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I just I just thought it was strange for her to claim that she doesn't know like she definitely knows she she probably doesn't understand everything.

440
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Like she probably doesn't understand why getting why defending why defending may saying that George Floyd deserved it by DMing me to tell me that I'm just jealous.

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's that Trixie gets pussy.

442
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
She probably doesn't understand why that's a bad thing to do and why that would make someone not like her.

443
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
What was the other one?

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,000
She might not understand that like telling the backers that like just because you paid me money for a thing doesn't mean I owe you that thing.

445
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:59,000
She might not understand that that was bad and would make someone not like her, but she must know even if she doesn't know why I did it.

446
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
She must remember the argument about Yig that made her leave the PCP.

447
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So for her to claim like complete ignorance is it can't be true.

448
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's not true.

449
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I kind of forget like what happened in that argument.

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Sure.

451
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, I was like if the thing was like you said Yig was bad, but for her Yig is good.

452
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes.

453
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And so she doesn't understand why you think it's bad.

454
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And then she said she doesn't she said she said like Ben, you're just being you're being negative.

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You know, you're hating.

456
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't remember I'm paraphrasing, but it was basically like Ben, you're hating Ben.

457
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I you can't talk about you can't talk about me that way.

458
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You can't talk about Yig that way.

459
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You can't talk about Riley that way.

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Riley gives me big money connections.

461
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Riley's given me big money connections.

462
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Big money connections that you'll never have anymore because now you're not my friend and I'm quitting the podcast.

463
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And that was literally it.

464
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That was literally like like like it.

465
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So anyway, my point is just that when she says she doesn't know it's a lie and and that's that's the kind of thing that that that the new like I hate Digiber video is filled with.

466
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's like just things that I know aren't true and it makes me really mad to hear someone say them and and people believe it, you know, really bugs me.

467
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But so that's really that really bothered me.

468
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The the Blu-ray situation.

469
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Continue only continues to get funnier.

470
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
However, by by Blu-rays, I'm almost sold out of my second batch.

471
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I have like 10.

472
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
No, I think I have nine that are unsold right now.

473
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
If more than nine people buy one, I mean, I can simply like buy more discs and produce some more.

474
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's not like I'm not going to run out and be like, oh, no more.

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Can't sell anymore.

476
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like I can.

477
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I have the equipment.

478
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But it would be cool to be funny to sell out of a second a second batch.

479
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I love money.

480
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

481
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's see.

482
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I guess.

483
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I guess I guess that's all I have to say about the Blu-rays and also about the the the the Digiber video.

484
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I mean, there's more I could say that was like weird about that.

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But yeah, whatever.

486
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I mean, personally, I agree.

487
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's just sort of like annoying to think about her and anything she's doing.

488
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Sure.

489
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I just ignore it as much as I can.

490
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I know what she talks about me.

491
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
When someone talks about me, I have to be like, oh, sure.

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Sure.

493
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But like, I know what she would say if she talked about me and she doesn't have anything to say.

494
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
She just doesn't like me because of you.

495
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's true.

496
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's literally what she said.

497
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
She said she doesn't.

498
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm paraphrasing again, but it was literally like, give a bad because give on podcast with Ben and Ben bad.

499
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And that's literally the reason.

500
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

501
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And then she doesn't say that about Tom.

502
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
She doesn't know that Tom is still on the PCP and she didn't even.

503
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, and she was talking about like members of the PCP that she had wanted to work with and that she worked well with.

504
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And she says Nate and Jess and she doesn't mention Tom and she doesn't mention I am games at all.

505
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's very weird.

506
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's very weird.

507
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

508
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
She likes people who can give her things.

509
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah.

510
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And she doesn't like people who can't or don't want to give her free shit.

511
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That's OK.

512
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's the that was the other thing I'll touch on it.

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah.

514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That was the other thing is the way that she does the way that she describes people.

515
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's her new friends in the video.

516
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's very much like she talks about how, you know, may she liked may because she could just basically groom may into a second version of herself.

517
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Honestly, it was creepy back then and it's creepy to hear her talk about it now.

518
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then she talks.

519
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

520
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
She talks about Mint and Riley and she basically says, I like Riley because Riley is my servant.

521
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Riley shows up and says, like, I will do things for you.

522
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I will I will do work for you.

523
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I will I will be your quote unquote producer.

524
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And she's like, yeah, so he's my good friend and Mint draws stuff for me for free and I don't have to pay her.

525
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So she's so she's a good friend.

526
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And it's and she talks about how like she wants what she wants in life.

527
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Her dream is just to live in a truck and go around with with friends and collaborate with people and work on projects.

528
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And then like when she talks about those people, the impression I get is that like really just what she wants is she wants a bunch of yes men around her that will tell her she's great and will do her work for her.

529
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
She wants Riley to make her big money connections or whatever, set up gigs or whatever for her.

530
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And she wants Mint to draw stuff for her and and and and whatever other shit she can get.

531
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
She wants Asher to edit videos for free for her, you know, dot dot dot.

532
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm extrapolating, you know, the list goes on.

533
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
She just wants whatever people will give her.

534
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I mean, what does she want to give to other people?

535
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Is there anything that's an excellent question?

536
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
She never talks about that.

537
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
She never she never talked about like what she could like when she was with May, she never talked about like what she could do for May or like how what May wanted.

538
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It was all about like what do I want?

539
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What am I doing to May to make her do what I want?

540
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And this is and with Bird.

541
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I mean, she barely even talks about Bird.

542
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
She I don't think she even mentions Bird in the video, but like she doesn't talk.

543
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
She, you know, in the same when she has, she just talks about, oh, he likes me.

544
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He makes me feel good, which I mean, I guess it's fine.

545
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If your partner makes you feel good or whatever.

546
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The point is that it's just a pattern.

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's never about like, it's never about what am I doing for them or like, what are they even like?

548
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's just about what do they give me always, always has been.

549
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
She compares, she compares me to Mint and she says, you know, Mint draws faster and Mint draws stuff for me.

550
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ben draw slow and I had to pay Ben to draw something for me.

551
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So Ben bad mint good.

552
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Like that's like that's directly what she says is a direct comparison.

553
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
She talks about when she wanted me to draw her banner and her icons and I didn't do it for a few months.

554
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And then she had to pay me for it.

555
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And she says and like that annoyed her, I guess.

556
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I don't know.

557
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
She doesn't mention that she didn't pay me.

558
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
She does not meant she neglects to mention that she did not pay me in advance.

559
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
She didn't pay me until after I had given it to her.

560
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So like, I don't know what the complaint is there, but you're right.

561
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Mint draws me for free.

562
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Ben, not do that.

563
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Ben bad.

564
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Ben bad man.

565
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Mint good.

566
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like everybody acts selfishly most of the time.

567
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Like you do things like I'm trying to make my life the best I can.

568
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But like the disconnect of like expecting people to do things for her without thinking that they would want something in return.

569
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Right.

570
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Like an exchange for a skill and a craft of someone else and money is like a pretty normal thing.

571
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah.

572
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It doesn't make someone like a good friend.

573
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's just such a weird mixing of like like.

574
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's really weird.

575
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I like it when people do things for free for me.

576
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Sure.

577
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Of course.

578
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But I wouldn't expect it of a person and I wouldn't think badly of someone if they ask for money because that's normal.

579
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The way it's just the way she talks about people is very, it's very, it's very creepy.

580
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's creepy.

581
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't know what else to say about it.

582
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay.

583
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And with that, I with that, I think I actually have exhausted anything I might have wanted to say about that.

584
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What about what else I have on my list here?

585
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

586
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You got anything?

587
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You got any topics?

588
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't know.

589
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Aside from getting the things ready to ship, I've mostly been working on the secret project and that's cool.

590
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah.

591
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But I don't want to talk too much about that.

592
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Sure.

593
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'll announce it when I'm ready to.

594
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Other than that, I've been watching Game of Thrones still.

595
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm up to the end.

596
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I just finished season six.

597
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So, okay.

598
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So, yeah, you're past where I ever made it to, I think.

599
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I've been looking at a lot of clips and a lot of reviews.

600
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I rewatched Lindsay Ellis' Game of Thrones two-part review thing, which is, I remember, pretty extensive.

601
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah.

602
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It gets to the root of what the actual problem of the show was.

603
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I was like, okay, yeah.

604
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, all these people, all these things, there's bad stuff.

605
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And I picked up on it in the show, like, hmm, bad stuff.

606
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I see it.

607
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I see the beginnings of bad stuff.

608
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But I still think season six has got some really good stuff in it.

609
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I feel like you could have easily turned that show into a perfect ending.

610
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's when it went off the books, right?

611
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It was season six is when we're no longer in book territory at all.

612
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, I could imagine they had season six wrap up a few plot threads and then start their own things ready for the ending of the show.

613
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But the things they started were just sort of shit, and they sucked.

614
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, okay.

615
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Darn.

616
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So, you have one more season to go, right?

617
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Two more.

618
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
They're like smaller seasons, but with longer episodes.

619
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Season seven has seven episodes.

620
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Season eight has six.

621
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But each episode is like a feature length film.

622
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Really?

623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Like 90 minutes?

624
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's something like, yeah, 90 minutes.

625
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Wow.

626
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

627
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So they're big, but like comparatively less happens in them.

628
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's just sort of like, and then this stuff, the stuff that was been building up through the whole season, and we took care of it.

629
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh, and we kill, and this person who was smart, now they're dumb, and they're dead.

630
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Get rid of like most of the characters.

631
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The ending of the show has like three people, and there were no new people introduced to replace the ones that died.

632
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
People just kept dying until there was no one left on screen.

633
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And it was like, there's not much to work with when you get rid of everybody.

634
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
No.

635
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's not good.

636
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But season six, I think is good.

637
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's a good one.

638
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You could salvage season six onwards.

639
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I heard the ending was bad.

640
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I know vaguely how it ends, but you know how it ends, right?

641
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yes.

642
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, obviously.

643
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I've seen it before.

644
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Wait, you've seen it before?

645
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You've watched it through before?

646
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah, I watched it when it was coming out.

647
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, I didn't know it was a rewatch.

648
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Didn't I explain it was a rewatch?

649
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You probably did.

650
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But I had COVID, and that was just one of the parts of my brain that had to go for the sake of efficiency.

651
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I see.

652
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I forgot.

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I forgot.

654
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
All right.

655
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I got you.

656
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I got you.

657
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's been getting me in a world building mood as well.

658
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah.

659
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm looking at videos on how to design a world map for your fantasy world.

660
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm like, oh, yeah.

661
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Think about mountain ranges and elevation and the ocean currents and how that would

662
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
affect the temperature of the places and what would grow there.

663
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And then if you know what grows there, what people, what would they eat and where would

664
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
they farm and who would they fight and this and that.

665
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Think of all these things.

666
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm like, yeah, I'll think of all those things.

667
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh boy.

668
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I still haven't drawn a shitty map, but I love maps right now.

669
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm brilliant at maps.

670
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Drawing a shitty map is the first step towards drawing a good map.

671
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
True.

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I guess paraphrase Jake the dog.

673
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
He probably didn't come up with that, which is fine.

674
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Have you seen the Game of Thrones full map?

675
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah.

676
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah.

677
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It looks funny as an image because it's just like a upright rectangle next to a sideways

678
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
rectangle.

679
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yeah.

680
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's Westeros and Essos.

681
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah.

682
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, it's England and Europe, right?

683
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's kind of just basically England is way bigger.

684
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Because it's like more important.

685
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

686
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They don't, the map doesn't, the map extends sort of into like an unknown area, right?

687
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Like doesn't the land just sort of continue off the east side?

688
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, up the north and like southeast is just sort of like not on the map, which is cool.

689
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
When I was looking into world building and maps, I was like, how do I draw it so that

690
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,600
it's the whole globe and it fits on like a projection of the globe, the Makata projection

691
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,000
or the whatever projection?

692
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And there's like a lot of maps don't bother with that.

693
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

694
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,300
If you were to like take the Game of Thrones map and wrap it around a globe, it would look

695
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,800
weird because it's not full.

696
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,100
It's not like actually the whole planet, which I think is a better way to do it honestly

697
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:09,060
because people use maps and they don't know the entire planet unless they're like futuristic

698
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,300
or like present day.

699
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Yeah.

700
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,220
If it's a fantasy like ancient times, they probably would not have cartographers that

701
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,300
have completely mapped out the entire world.

702
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Yeah.

703
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,400
In like the time, in like the real world historical time, the Game of Thrones is like sort of

704
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,640
based on, yeah, they probably just wouldn't have maps beyond like the Balkans or whatever

705
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,640
mountain.

706
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,640
What's the mountain?

707
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,600
Is there a mountain range between like Europe and Russia?

708
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Not Russia.

709
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Well, there probably is.

710
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Yeah.

711
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm thinking of the Alps, which is like in the middle of Europe.

712
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Yeah.

713
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,920
They probably just wouldn't have great maps.

714
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,360
It's been like, yeah, and then there's just like China is over there somewhere, you know.

715
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:59,160
I've seen like maps where like America was only just beginning to be understood.

716
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Yeah.

717
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,120
And they would have like, oh, Europe and all that big Africa, huge.

718
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,600
And then on the left side, there'll be like a really thin sliver, which is South America

719
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,240
and another tiny little dot, which is like North America.

720
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,280
They didn't really understand how big it was or how far across it went.

721
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
That's awesome.

722
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Yeah.

723
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Yeah.

724
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Well, why would they?

725
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
What?

726
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
It's so weird.

727
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,240
Because like they didn't they like they miss like they kind of miscalculated the like the

728
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
size of the globe.

729
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Right.

730
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,160
Like they just like that's isn't that why like Columbus thought he could know he didn't

731
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,880
somebody thought they could get they could sail all the way across the ocean.

732
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,000
And it was because they had like miscalculated the size and they just thought it was like

733
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
a lot smaller.

734
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,120
I thought it was a smaller distance.

735
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Yeah.

736
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
I don't know.

737
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,040
North America was in the way like North America was blocking the way, obviously, but even

738
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,920
if North America hadn't been there, like it still wouldn't have made it because they

739
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,280
just like it was like would have been just way farther.

740
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
I think.

741
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Yeah.

742
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Yeah.

743
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:11,880
I think the first the first one of the first guys to go West was like an Italian called

744
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
Americo.

745
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
Yeah.

746
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,960
Which America is like named after.

747
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Yeah.

748
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,960
That's funny.

749
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Good.

750
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Good for him.

751
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Proud of him.

752
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
And then Columbus called Columbia.

753
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,480
You know, you know, I can't believe the woke agenda.

754
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,400
They changed Americo to America.

755
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
They made it.

756
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,560
They put a girl's name in my continent.

757
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,320
Why do they have to woke a fire like that?

758
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,800
Fucking America X.

759
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Yes.

760
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
I mean, no.

761
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
I mean, no, good old fashioned Americo.

762
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Please.

763
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm just going to start calling it the United States of America now because that's how it

764
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,320
returned to the return.

765
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Yeah.

766
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:07,480
It's yet to Europa and America like this, the moon and the sun, the man and female, the

767
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,040
dragon of chaos, if the theory of the chaos feminine and the law order masculine, Jordan

768
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,040
Peterson.

769
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,840
I don't know anything about this bullshit.

770
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
I don't.

771
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:27,200
I've heard like once before and it's like a book and it was filled with insane like illustrations

772
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
and nonsense.

773
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,800
There's some really bizarre diagrams and like weird illusions to like young and archetypes

774
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,120
in a way that sounds like he's just describing like like a mythology dragons and shit.

775
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
I don't know.

776
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,120
I don't know.

777
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Yeah.

778
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,120
So.

779
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
Oh, yeah.

780
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Yeah.

781
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
I remember chaos.

782
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,520
The dragon or a Boris chaos dragon.

783
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,360
Oh, that's all my my Yu-Gi-Oh my family Yu-Gi-Oh deck is a dragon or a Boris chaos dragon.

784
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Play it.

785
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,800
It's got so many life points.

786
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Oh, hell yeah.

787
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,640
You know, maybe this isn't Jordan Peterson.

788
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,280
Wait, no, this one is the dragon of chaos, the king of order.

789
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,080
It's just like it sounds like him.

790
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,080
Yeah.

791
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,720
Sounds like his his work.

792
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
Very funny.

793
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Very.

794
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,720
It's very.

795
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Yes.

796
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Yeah.

797
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
The walled garden.

798
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Yeah.

799
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
Descent and disintegration anomalous information.

800
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,720
You look at this and you're like, oh, okay.

801
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah.

802
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,720
I'm looking at it.

803
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Sure.

804
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,320
So anomalous information comes from the chaos dragon into the walled garden.

805
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
Of course.

806
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,720
And I assume that's a good thing.

807
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,360
I think this is a stable system and it's fine actually.

808
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,000
This looks it looks balanced.

809
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah.

810
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,240
It looks it looks about right.

811
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,160
So I've been working on I have also been working on my project Phantom's Revenge.

812
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,440
I hit Phantom's Revenge.

813
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,320
I hit an unexpected snag with it this week.

814
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,400
I hit a really annoying roadblock that made me kind of throw up my hands and like leave

815
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000
it for a while or for a few days.

816
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,800
And that was that I I tried to X.

817
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Okay.

818
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,400
My plan was, you know, I had the game as an executable file and my plan was I'm going

819
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,840
to have it a downloadable executable on itch right itch.io and and then I was going to

820
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,920
have an HTML version that would be hosted on my website.

821
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,640
And it would also be I would put it I would put that I would also put that on itch and

822
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,560
I would also put it on new grounds because it would be nice if I could like, I don't

823
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,480
know, maybe hit the front page of new grounds or something that would be cool.

824
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,720
Tom did that with a zoomie and it seems to have worked out fine.

825
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:53,080
So but anyway, I went to first I was like, wait, there's no option to just create as

826
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
an HTML file.

827
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Why?

828
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,240
And then I realized that like my license had expired, like my user license for GameMaker

829
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Studio had expired.

830
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
And so it just took that option away from me.

831
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,360
It was like, it was like, okay.

832
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,160
So I had to renew my subscription, which didn't end up being that much.

833
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,560
I think they actually gave me like a free trial year or something.

834
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,880
So it didn't actually cost me much or anything.

835
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
So that was good.

836
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,640
But it took me a while to figure out that that was what I had to do.

837
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,000
So I did that and then I had it and then I, I exported it as an HTML to find that like

838
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,960
a bunch of shit is broken.

839
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,240
A bunch of shit just doesn't work in the HTML version, like a bunch of things that were

840
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,320
supposed to like fade in or fade out were instead like flashing.

841
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:43,920
There was a part, hold on, I'll show you, I'll show you this.

842
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,880
Look at this fucking GIF.

843
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Hold on.

844
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,320
How do I, how do I, how do I get it?

845
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,440
Copy direct link.

846
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,080
No download GIF.

847
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,520
Look at this GIF of the, of the starting menu.

848
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,840
Yeah, this, this is what the opening menu looked like.

849
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:10,440
Like it's supposed to have like the titles not supposed to be flashing the cur, there's

850
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,000
like a weird little like spot appearing at the bottom next to the quit option.

851
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,360
And then the arrow icon is like this weird like spazzing out thing.

852
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,160
It's like cycling through a bunch of sprites for something.

853
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,160
Yeah.

854
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,280
It's cycling through a bunch of like similarly sized sprites and I have no fucking clue why

855
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,280
it would do that.

856
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,280
It's insane.

857
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,800
And, and even, and I tried to go in and I tried to like, okay, let me see if I can fix

858
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,080
it and I go in and I, this, this blows, this, this is like the worst thing ever.

859
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:53,320
Like I sound, I, I'm going to sound insane to myself saying this, but I went in and I,

860
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,360
I saw the, the, the object that, that defines this behavior and I changed some things to

861
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,120
try to make it work and it sort of worked.

862
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,400
Like it, it half fixed the problem.

863
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,960
It was displaying the correct sprite, but it was like at the wrong speed and I was like,

864
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,960
hmm, okay.

865
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
So then I reverted my changes.

866
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,840
I reverted them all back to exactly how it was before I started changing anything.

867
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,600
And then it worked and then it worked.

868
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
And then it worked normally.

869
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:28,320
So like, like you, like the same, the same export, same exact, well different export,

870
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,280
but with, with all my changes reverted.

871
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,360
So the code was exactly the same, but it just worked.

872
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,200
Yeah, I don't know.

873
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,520
So like this kind of thing was all over the HTML version.

874
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:47,120
Like, there were just things, like the reason why things are flashing, like the title was

875
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:54,520
because it like, it like understood alpha values, like, like opacity values.

876
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,480
It read the numbers differently in the executable version.

877
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,360
The number, like the number out, the, the, the opacity value varies from zero to one.

878
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,160
One is fully opaque.

879
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,680
And if you go above that, it just is like, okay, well, you can't go over one.

880
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,560
So it just one, but in the HTML version, if you go over one, if you do like 1.1, it's

881
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,080
like, well, that doesn't make any sense.

882
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,160
Let me just drop the, the integer and read it as a point one.

883
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,600
So you know, one 10th opacity.

884
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,720
So it was like interpreting that differently.

885
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,880
And there were other things were like, whereas in the one version, two things drawn on the

886
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,760
same layer, one would draw on top of the other in the HTML version, it would reverse

887
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,840
and like the other thing would draw on top.

888
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,400
So the game had all these weird little like quirks in it that I like, I don't know why

889
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,000
they're there, but I had to try and fix them.

890
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,080
And so I started working on it and I was making progress and I was like, okay, I can fix most

891
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:53,080
of these issues, but I kind of think that maybe it's not worth it.

892
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,600
Maybe it's not worth doing this right now.

893
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,080
I kind of think that, I think maybe my new plan is that I won't make the HTML version

894
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
right away.

895
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,160
I'll just take what I've got with the executable version that works and just release that

896
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,280
on itch.

897
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,360
Like instead of, instead of hosting the game on my website, I'll just have, when you get

898
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,400
to that part in the comic of slime and punishment, I'll just have a splash page that leads you

899
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,880
to the itch page that lets you download the game, right?

900
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,280
And then later, later I can make an HTML version.

901
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,320
And if I feel like it, I can update my website to be that, I can, I'll put it on, I eventually

902
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,560
want to have it on Newgrounds.

903
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,760
I want to see how it does there.

904
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,640
So I think I might just do that later, because like ...

905
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:43,040
So yeah, it's definitely the right thing to do is to get it out first.

906
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,520
Getting it out all, like it's like, it's a port.

907
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,040
If the code is read differently, there's going to be loads of things that you're going to

908
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,800
have to figure out what, how they're changed and why.

909
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
I don't know.

910
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,680
It's a whole like months long, many months of like tinkering.

911
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Possibly.

912
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:07,640
I hope it doesn't take that long, but yeah, the executable version just works.

913
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,960
So I think I just got to do that, like whatever.

914
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:22,800
And then if, oh shit, I was going to say HTML executable.

915
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:30,080
Oh, I don't know, like, I hope that maybe a side effect of that might be that more people

916
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,680
might be inclined to like donate, because like, it prompts you to like donate something

917
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,400
to the creator when you download the file, not when you play an HTML version.

918
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,800
So I kind of think that maybe it's sort of has a side benefit as well of like, well now

919
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,200
people that want to play it will have to, you know, the way to play it is the downloadable

920
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
version.

921
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,360
One, it works better.

922
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,720
It will not have any glitches that were introduced with like the switch.

923
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,840
And two, you know, just get that little prompt, like do you want to donate something to this

924
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
creator?

925
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,640
I think a lot of people don't have a problem donating, would like, would donate, but just,

926
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,040
you know, they just need to be asked.

927
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,200
They just need to have the request made, and then they'll be like, yeah, sure, toss you

928
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,840
five bucks or whatever.

929
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,760
So maybe it will help me in that way as well.

930
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,840
So I think that's what I'm going to do.

931
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Yeah.

932
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:28,760
But now I have to, I realized with a bit of like a sinking heart that now that the game

933
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,920
is like done, the game is like done, done, if I'm just going to release the executable

934
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
versions.

935
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,560
And now I have to actually do the thing where I go and I draw the end of slime and punishment.

936
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,440
And like, that's cool, I guess.

937
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,000
But I'm also like, that's actually going to be like, I hope how many little pages will

938
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,400
that be?

939
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
I don't know.

940
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,640
I hope it won't be too many.

941
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:08,640
I think it will probably be, I'm going to ballpark it, maybe like 20, 24 ish.

942
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,920
Some of them I want to like take care and make them look a bit, a bit, no, probably maybe

943
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,120
like 36 or something.

944
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,200
So that's, that's, that's not insubstantial thing, you know, I try to, I try to slime

945
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
and punishment.

946
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,000
I like I'm okay if the artwork is a little sloppy.

947
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,400
So like some of them, maybe it will, maybe it won't be that many.

948
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
I don't know.

949
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,640
I haven't, I haven't like blocked it out or anything.

950
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:38,560
So I'm really just guessing I will, I'm going to try to keep it as minimal as possible.

951
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:44,440
But there is like, there is a non insubstantial amount of story left to tell.

952
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:52,240
I mean, yeah, he, Phantom has to go to the place where the game happens.

953
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,240
And then there's the conclusion after the game, the, the aftermath of the game.

954
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,080
I added, I did something that I might regret, but I think I want to do it.

955
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,400
I made a change to the game and this affects like everything where I think I'm going to

956
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,400
make it.

957
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Oh my God.

958
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Phantom horn.

959
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
So girl.

960
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,520
I think I'm going to make it so that the website, because like you read slime and punishment

961
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,600
on my website, I think I'm going to make it so that the website does not let you read

962
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,600
the ending.

963
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,120
The only way to find the link to the ending is to beat the game and the game will give

964
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,800
you like the link at the end.

965
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,080
I think I'm going to do it.

966
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:44,160
That is, um, well, surely the link, if somebody just had the link, they could copy paste it

967
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
and give it some match.

968
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,160
Sure.

969
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Sure.

970
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,160
It could be, it could be worked around.

971
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Sure.

972
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,880
I remember when I did like the, the punk run away from snakes page of Balejape, that like

973
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,320
the idea is that you beat that little endless runner, get to the end and then you get the

974
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,480
next page and click on that.

975
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,480
Yeah.

976
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,920
But I realized that one, people might not want to play it all the way through like on

977
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:18,600
a second read and two, it was kind of hard to get working on the website and it was like

978
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:26,120
buggy and like, it was probably like a bad idea to like force people to, to play it.

979
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,840
So I had like, after a few seconds, a little bit of the text on the website says, you can

980
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,520
just go to the next page if you want.

981
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,920
Oh, because like, like if it's like, if it's like glitching or whatever.

982
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,080
If it's like glitching or it's too hard, it's just like, it's not that important to like

983
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
play that.

984
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,080
It's just fun.

985
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,080
Like the idea of it is fun.

986
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,080
Yeah.

987
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:53,040
I, that, I, you're right, like, I did, I did think about this and I might, I might still

988
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
change my mind.

989
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,600
But like, um, maybe for like the initial release, you can have it like that.

990
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,720
But first, there are some people, there will inevitably be some people who like, maybe

991
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,200
they, they, they're playing on a Mac or something and like the game doesn't work for them.

992
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,600
And like, that's, that's a bummer.

993
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Yeah.

994
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,600
Stuff like that as well.

995
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,600
If the game just doesn't play.

996
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,600
Yeah.

997
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,000
Or it might just not, or that computer can't handle it.

998
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,720
That would be a really shitty computer.

999
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,640
Um, but yeah, like really, they just, uh, can't play games.

1000
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,680
Maybe they don't have hands.

1001
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,200
I mean, there's, I mean, the thing is, uh, I mean, the game is hard, like the game

1002
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,440
is not easy.

1003
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,400
So like, there's, there definitely will be people who just can't beat it.

1004
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Uh,

1005
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,560
I'll try to beat it on stream.

1006
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,360
I think that'll be fun and fail terribly.

1007
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,840
It's actually, I made it, I made it so that, um, I mentioned last time there, there's a,

1008
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
there's a bad ending.

1009
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,680
Like if you're, if you're bad, if you're bad at the game, you can win, but it's the bad

1010
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
ending.

1011
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,280
So I made it so that like at the end, you see the, the victory screen and then you get

1012
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:09,560
the option to, um, the way it is right now, it's like you get to read, you can replay,

1013
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,200
like do another run, or you can go back to the main menu or the third option is like,

1014
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,400
you know, continue the story, like read the rest of the comic and that will, that will

1015
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
link you.

1016
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,200
That will open up a webpage that links you to does the secret URL to the, the conclusion

1017
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,000
Uh, so yeah, the other separate endings for good and bad.

1018
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,800
Like if you play badly, you get a link to a shitty ending.

1019
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,480
No, the way it is right now is that if you, if you get the bad ending, the continue the

1020
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,880
story option is grayed out.

1021
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,000
And if you try to select it, endless war pops up and he goes like, no, that's not canon.

1022
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,400
Do it right this time.

1023
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,560
I think that's pretty funny.

1024
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,560
You need to get over 9,000 points.

1025
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,880
I think, okay, I mean, here, here's the thing.

1026
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,840
I think that then probably the number of people who have actually like red slime and punishment

1027
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
is pretty low.

1028
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,880
I think that that will be pretty low compared to the people who have, who might end up like

1029
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,960
playing the game in an, in an optimistic scenario, the game might get a little bit of the game

1030
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,200
might get seen around a little bit.

1031
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,560
And so in that case, and most of those people probably don't care about the comic.

1032
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,360
They might just be playing the game because it's a game.

1033
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:26,840
And so I think it's like, like numbers wise in terms of like engagement audience retention,

1034
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,080
I don't think it really matters that like, you don't get the real ending unless you beat

1035
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,080
the game.

1036
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:38,760
Uh, but I kind of think, I don't know, I want to just like punish my, my true fans.

1037
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,480
I don't want to make them, I want to make them earn it.

1038
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,120
I don't know.

1039
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,800
It just feels, it feels valuable.

1040
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:51,760
It feels valuable to me that like, no, you don't, you don't just get to see the ending.

1041
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,840
You have to earn the ending.

1042
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:58,480
You have to take, you have to be phantom and you have to, as phantom, you must, you know,

1043
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:06,640
best this, this deadly gauntlet and only then can do you and phantom together as one earn

1044
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:14,320
the, the, the catharsis that comes of the conclusion.

1045
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:21,200
I can see myself, I can see myself like playing phantom's revenge, trying to like it and being

1046
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,960
like, I hate this, this sucks so much.

1047
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,960
I hate this game.

1048
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,960
It's a piece of shit.

1049
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,040
I'd rage and it'd be like uncomfortable.

1050
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,440
It wouldn't even be funny.

1051
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
Yeah.

1052
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,440
Yeah.

1053
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:40,080
And then I'd eventually maybe beat it and I'll be like, I get the bad ending or something.

1054
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,080
Here's, here's the thing.

1055
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,280
Here's, here's what I, I'll scream really loudly.

1056
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:49,060
Here's what I hope would happen because the game is solvable.

1057
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:53,640
There is a strategy that if you employ, if you employ, you can, you can just win.

1058
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,920
And if you know that strategy, it's merely a matter, if you, if you figure it out, it's

1059
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,040
merely just a matter of executing it.

1060
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:05,840
So I mean, you could just, somebody could just like tell you, like two or more people

1061
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,000
could just commiserate on like, oh, I can't figure out how to do it.

1062
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,280
And the other person was like, oh, well you just, you just got to do this.

1063
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,000
Like, oh, in, in this room, you know, the optimal strategy is, is this.

1064
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,040
You gotta do the backwards long jump.

1065
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,040
Yeah.

1066
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,240
Or somebody, or somebody might just like write up a guide or something.

1067
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:27,000
So like if, if people were like, if people were like frustrated by the game, I would

1068
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,040
hope that that would maybe lead for some people to be like, okay, well here's how you beat

1069
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,040
it.

1070
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,440
And maybe, I don't know, I think maybe it would get people talking about it a little

1071
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,720
bit more.

1072
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,280
Maybe it would lead to some greater engagement.

1073
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,960
These people are like, wow, there's this game that I can't beat.

1074
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
This game seems cool.

1075
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,960
It looks good.

1076
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,960
It's kind of fun.

1077
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,960
It's kind of funny.

1078
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,960
But I can't beat it.

1079
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,960
What the fuck?

1080
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,960
Yeah.

1081
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,320
So I think that's what I got to do.

1082
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,280
And if people, and if people really want to see the ending and they want to be, and they

1083
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:03,080
want to, and they want to cheat and not beat the game, well, they can, they can just, they

1084
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,640
can just do that on their own time.

1085
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,840
They're, they're, as Tim Rogers might say, under no circumstances are they allowed to

1086
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,960
tell me that they did that.

1087
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,960
Uh, yeah.

1088
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,320
So, uh, anyway, that's what I'm looking forward to it.

1089
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh, I'm just looking forward to it.

1090
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I wish it were out.

1091
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,920
I kind of expected it to be out already.

1092
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,400
I have, I worked on it for a lot of January.

1093
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,360
I sort of expected it to not be being worked on anymore.

1094
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:38,000
I kind of expected to be well underway drawing the pages by now, and I'm not, uh, but I will

1095
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,600
have to get started on that soon and I don't know.

1096
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,600
We'll see.

1097
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,600
We'll see.

1098
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,520
Um, shouldn't, it shouldn't be that long.

1099
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:52,840
Climate punishment used to, I used to bang out like four or eight panels in a day, some,

1100
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,120
not every day, but some days.

1101
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:00,040
So like maybe if I really banged it out, I could do, I could draw it all in a week.

1102
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,400
Maybe that's not a guarantee.

1103
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
It might take long.

1104
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,840
It might take longer because I might want to be a little more fussy about the, uh, you

1105
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,960
know, the ending, want to make it look, want to make it look good.

1106
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Don't want, don't want it to be sloppy.

1107
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
Uh, yeah.

1108
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,960
Yeah.

1109
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:21,960
Um, but the ending I have been, I think the ending, I don't know.

1110
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:29,160
It's hard when I think about the ending, the ending I have envisioned, it really makes

1111
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,920
me feel something.

1112
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,360
I'm not going to say what emotion it is, but it really makes me feel it.

1113
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,640
And so I, I guess I would hope that other people would feel it, but I always find that

1114
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:50,360
like, I always feel like maybe it's just inevitable when you make something that like when other

1115
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,680
people read it, they, they don't have the same reaction.

1116
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,480
Like a lot of times you might make something that you, you find like, oh, this is disgusting

1117
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,320
or like this is, this is like horrifying, but maybe people might read it and they, and

1118
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,320
they laugh.

1119
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,280
And that's okay.

1120
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,280
Yeah.

1121
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,320
But I wonder, I wonder maybe if it will be some, if maybe people will read the ending

1122
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,480
and they will feel differently about it than I do.

1123
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,360
And it's okay if that's the case, but I'm, I'm curious, I'm curious.

1124
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
It's definitely okay.

1125
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:25,400
It's one of those, those things where it's like you make art for yourself.

1126
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
Yeah.

1127
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,280
You don't make art so that other people can feel emotions while you just have nothing.

1128
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah.

1129
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,720
And if you do, you better be getting paid for it at least.

1130
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,120
Hell yeah.

1131
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,040
You better hit that donate button on itch.io.

1132
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:47,480
It worked on, it worked on this game for a year.

1133
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,320
I hope, I hope I make a, it would be nice to make at least a little something from it.

1134
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to charge money upfront for it, but

1135
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:05,120
I hope, I hope that the, I hope maybe people will throw some, some, some coins in my coffer.

1136
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:10,680
Not that like I need money or anything, not that I'm like hurting for money, but still

1137
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:16,360
it worked really, I worked really hard, worked really fucking hard on this thing.

1138
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:23,640
I guess maybe even nobody donates, only a year, only a year, uh, uh, uh, fucking, uh.

1139
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,360
When, what month did you start?

1140
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,480
I started, well, I officially started working on it in December of 2020.

1141
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,480
I had done a little bit of work on like some sprites kind of before that.

1142
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,880
Okay, so it's a little over a year.

1143
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,480
A little bit over a year, yeah.

1144
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:48,960
Um, even, even, I guess even if, even if it doesn't make any money and like realistically

1145
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,920
I don't expect it to make more than like maybe a few hundred dollars, that's, that's optimistic.

1146
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:00,200
I'd be, it would be optimistic to think that like a hundred, a hundred people might hit

1147
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,760
that donate button.

1148
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:08,720
Um, but, uh, even if, if they, if they don't, and they won't, I guess I hope to monetize

1149
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,160
it in a way with the, with the eventual slime and punishment Kickstarter, uh, for a book

1150
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,160
which maybe, maybe I'll do it later this year.

1151
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:24,800
Uh, so, you know, the returns, the returns are ephemeral, the returns are nebulous.

1152
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,800
They have, they have yet, they have to be forcibly materialized later through Guile

1153
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:43,920
and, uh, Chicanery, uh, I added a new option on the starting menu, uh, that says it's

1154
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,920
read the comic.

1155
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:51,160
It just brings you to the first page of, uh, slime and punishment on stcomics.com.

1156
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,400
I already, I already had the, what is this option explaining like what slime and punishment

1157
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,840
is, but like, it's probably good to have an actual link and they're like, okay, well,

1158
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:06,760
if you want to actually read it, here it is, um, and, and, and so, and so there it is.

1159
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,400
Um, I don't know.

1160
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,800
I hope people like the game.

1161
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
I'm very excited.

1162
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,480
I'm very excited about it.

1163
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,080
I'm really, I hope, I hope it does.

1164
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,920
I hope it's, I hope it gets seen.

1165
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,920
I hope people like it.

1166
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,920
I hope people talk about it.

1167
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,480
I hope, uh, it generates a little bit of interest that'd be very, make me very happy.

1168
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:39,080
Um, mif, mif, ah, yeah, I don't, I, I've also been working out on my secret project,

1169
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,440
but I, I, it's just, it's just not right yet.

1170
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,600
Not quite right.

1171
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,600
Not quite.

1172
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
To, to, to mention it.

1173
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
To, to, to, to.

1174
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Oh, okay.

1175
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,600
Okay.

1176
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:57,520
You said, um, you said you thought maybe January or February, is it, or is it still on?

1177
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,600
February is still like quite possible.

1178
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Yeah.

1179
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Um, yeah.

1180
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Yeah.

1181
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,600
Yeah.

1182
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
Yes.

1183
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,600
Right.

1184
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,600
Right.

1185
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,000
The second, the, my first thought is like Lord of Ghosts, back around those, just get

1186
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
them sent.

1187
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's fair.

1188
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
That's fair.

1189
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,320
Um, so I'll be working on that while I'm sending those out.

1190
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,920
I ha, I do ha, I have to admit that the Blu-rays have taken a bit of my attention away from,

1191
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:28,600
uh, I think that's kind of maybe why I'm, the Blu-rays are probably why I have not, uh,

1192
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,920
gotten further along with the actual drawing of it because they've taken, they've taken

1193
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,920
time.

1194
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,080
You know, I've had to produce the discs and I've had to, you know, address the envelopes

1195
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,520
and get them in the mail and stuff, which takes, uh, you know, I've had to devote some,

1196
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,200
some mental energy to that, but it's okay.

1197
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,200
It's worthwhile.

1198
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,320
It's worth, it's worth doing.

1199
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,320
So I don't regret it, but you gotta split your, you gotta split your attention sometimes.

1200
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Um, yeah, I guess, I guess that's all I have to say about that this week.

1201
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,800
Um, fuck, fuck HTML.

1202
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
Why doesn't it just work?

1203
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,320
Why doesn't it just work like the executable file?

1204
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,640
Can't, can't fucking believe all this undefined behavior bullshit I have to deal with.

1205
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,760
And blood splatters drawing underneath the floor and shit.

1206
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,800
Give me a, give me a fucking break.

1207
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:27,400
Um, speaking of give me a fucking break, I, I don't, I don't have to go on at great length

1208
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:34,480
about this, but I kind of do want to mention something that made me mad this week and I've

1209
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,480
been mad about it for a while, which was, uh, the artist for the Radcon dojin.

1210
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,480
Oh yeah.

1211
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:52,020
Uh, so I announced this on Twitter, you know, we had a guy, I'm not, I'm not sure if it's

1212
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,520
like cruel.

1213
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,040
I'm not sure if it's like cruel to say who I've mentioned who it is before.

1214
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,880
I kind of feel like saying it might drive like negative.

1215
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,080
I don't, I don't know if anyone cares enough that they would go and like harass him about

1216
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,760
it, but they might maybe and like, I don't want him, I don't want him harassed.

1217
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,040
There's no reason to say is no.

1218
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:18,840
Even though I'm angry, even though I'm angry at him, um, but yeah, the, we had an artist

1219
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:25,560
working on the dojin and they had done sketches and they had done like a few like some of

1220
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,400
the pages were, were drawn or like mostly drawn.

1221
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,680
They looked really good, which was the annoying thing.

1222
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,680
They did.

1223
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,680
They did.

1224
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:37,600
That is annoying because I like his art and I thought his style was a good fit for the

1225
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,480
project, which is like, he had, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say he just draws, he doesn't

1226
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:47,240
draw like a generic, it's not generic anime, but it's, it's a, it's a very anime look.

1227
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,400
It's a very old school kind of anime look, but it's cute too.

1228
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:56,680
It worked really well for what I thought the dojin would look like.

1229
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,920
And this guy was not a guy with a ton of followers, he didn't have a big account or anything.

1230
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:07,240
And I, and he had done, um, years ago, he had done a piece of Brunswick fan art.

1231
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,520
He had just sent me a drawing of, of me and Brunswick from the Brunswick comic and I liked

1232
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,160
it and this is how I found this guy.

1233
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,520
I thought it was good.

1234
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,920
So I wanted to give him, we had a couple artists in mind and I thought he was the best fit

1235
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,280
and also I wanted to give him the chance.

1236
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,640
So I, I pushed for this guy and everyone seemed to be fine with it.

1237
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,160
So we're like, okay.

1238
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:32,840
So we talked to him and he, he, we agreed that like, okay, the manga would be 24 pages,

1239
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:39,440
the PC, not all of them, but some of the PCP dating sim people had written the script.

1240
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,840
I had, I had commissioned them for the script.

1241
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,520
So we gave it to him and was like, okay, it's 24 pages.

1242
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:50,800
I'll pay you half up, half upfront and half on completion, right?

1243
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,160
So he, and, and we said, do you think you can have it in a month?

1244
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,320
And I think he agreed to, it was either like a month or, or maybe a little over a month,

1245
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,600
maybe like five weeks or something.

1246
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,320
And I was like, okay.

1247
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,760
So a month goes by, he sends me like one, shortly after he sends me like one page and

1248
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,960
I'm like, it looks good.

1249
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Keep it up.

1250
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,080
So then a month goes by and I ask him like, Hey, you know, what's up?

1251
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,320
Now I didn't expect it to be done.

1252
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,880
Like I kind of expected him to be like, it took longer than I thought.

1253
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,600
And I was, and I was going to be like, okay, that's fine.

1254
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,600
I don't care.

1255
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:31,280
It doesn't bother me, but I send him after a month and he doesn't get back to me.

1256
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,680
It takes him like a week or like two weeks or something to get back to me.

1257
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,680
It takes him a while.

1258
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,880
And I start to wonder like, did this guy disappear?

1259
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,800
Is this guy gone?

1260
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:45,320
But he eventually gets back to me and he's like, Hey, sorry, you know, oh, my notifications

1261
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
don't work.

1262
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,000
You know, my, my discord notifications just don't work and Twitter too, all my notifications

1263
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
don't work.

1264
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's weird.

1265
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And I'm like, okay, fine.

1266
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,360
And he shows me what he had and it was good.

1267
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,640
And he was like, sorry, it's late.

1268
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,920
You can dock my pay if you want.

1269
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,240
And I'm like, no, no, I don't need to dock your pay.

1270
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,160
It's, I don't care about that.

1271
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Just, just, you know, just keep at it.

1272
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:11,960
And then, and then I'm like, and then a month later, I asked him like, Hey, what, what's

1273
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,040
the, Hey, what's the update?

1274
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,040
How's it going?

1275
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,000
Haven't heard from you in a while.

1276
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,440
And then I don't know, man.

1277
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,440
The point is like three or four months go by.

1278
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,720
It's been like three months at this point.

1279
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,520
We agreed to one month initially, it's been three and it's been a full month since I've

1280
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,760
been messaging him and asking and even adding him on Twitter, being like, can you talk to

1281
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,000
me?

1282
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And he's just gone.

1283
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
He's just nowhere.

1284
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,600
And it's so ghosting, complete ghosting.

1285
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,640
He didn't on the one, he did accept money.

1286
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
He did.

1287
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:53,200
He, he did basically take my money and run, but it's not a complete that because he did

1288
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,160
turn in something, you know, I paid him half.

1289
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,840
He turned in, I think like nine or 10 pages.

1290
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:06,840
So he didn't do nothing, but he didn't quite earn his money either.

1291
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:14,640
So he semi took the money and ran and like worse than that is just that he didn't tell

1292
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,720
me if he was, if he wanted to quit, if he wanted to like, Hey, I don't want to do the

1293
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,720
project anymore.

1294
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,400
Just fucking tell me, don't fucking ghost me.

1295
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,360
It's, it's upsetting.

1296
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
It's really upsetting.

1297
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,960
It's like, I don't know, I don't commission a lot of art.

1298
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,960
So maybe this kind of thing is more common than I thought, but I'm like mad.

1299
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,480
I'm like disgusted.

1300
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,640
Like I can't believe that a person would do this.

1301
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,240
Like it's so, it's beyond unprofessional.

1302
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,360
It's beyond unprofessional.

1303
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,440
It's despicable.

1304
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,400
I'm fucking getting riled up.

1305
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,480
Like why would you treat another human being this way, let alone someone who's fucking

1306
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,800
paying you money for a service?

1307
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,800
My God.

1308
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Yeah.

1309
01:17:52,080 --> 01:18:01,680
I, I, I've commissioned artists before and I, you know, things often take longer than

1310
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,680
you expect.

1311
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,680
Sure.

1312
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,760
I don't really know how to like, to, to gauge like deadlines.

1313
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,720
I'm just happy that they stay in contact.

1314
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,280
It doesn't actually happen that often that they, they ghost me though.

1315
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
No.

1316
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,720
I don't think it's ever really happened.

1317
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,640
Maybe it's just been a while and I've been like, maybe I shouldn't press it too much.

1318
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,640
Right.

1319
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:29,800
So like complete, like abandonment, like no response at all on anything has not happened.

1320
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,400
It, there's a, there's a few more wrinkles to it.

1321
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:43,120
When I had, when I came, realized that like DMing him on Twitter and Discord was not working.

1322
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,320
I went on, I went on Twitter and I, because I saw him like, you know, he would occasionally

1323
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,280
post some art on Twitter.

1324
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,720
He would, he would, he would like, he was like stuff on Twitter.

1325
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,480
Like he had liked something on Twitter like that day.

1326
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,640
And so I went on Twitter and I added him publicly and I was like, Hey, can anyone get in contact

1327
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,600
with this guy?

1328
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,400
And that was the last time he ever liked anything on Twitter.

1329
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,280
He just stopped going on Twitter after that.

1330
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,680
So that was funny.

1331
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,680
And the final like insult is that like, you know, I went to his link tree to try to find,

1332
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,600
because he had said, he had made up some shit about like how his notifications weren't working.

1333
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,840
So I went to his link tree to try to find other ways to contact him just in case.

1334
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,200
And I found his email.

1335
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,800
I think, I think you looked at the link tree actually.

1336
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,200
I, yeah, I, I Googled his name.

1337
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,440
I found his link tree.

1338
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Yeah.

1339
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,640
So, and he, and he had, so he was, he was, he was gone off all social media.

1340
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,280
The one thing he was still using was any list, which is basically like my anime list where

1341
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,360
you list shows that you've seen.

1342
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,640
The only thing he was still posting on was, was any list.

1343
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:55,240
And like, like three, it was before I made the post, like three hours ago, he had like,

1344
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,200
he had finished watching like some Gundam anime.

1345
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,720
Like he's still, he's off all regular social media, but he's still, he's watching anime

1346
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,200
and he's like, and he's updating his like anime's watch list.

1347
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,000
And I'm like, guy, you didn't die.

1348
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,080
I was, I, ooh, I was really hoping to find out you had died in a tragic accident.

1349
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,080
And that was why.

1350
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,040
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

1351
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,360
So now I have to be very cross with you.

1352
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:26,280
It's like, I don't know what, why are people, I get why people are scared of confrontation.

1353
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,880
Like, oh no, I didn't do my homework.

1354
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,800
The teacher's going to kill me.

1355
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,800
Yeah.

1356
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,200
But like, it's always worse if you don't ever say anything.

1357
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:43,000
Like that every show, every piece of media where a character could tell the truth and

1358
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,200
get scolded or instead chooses to tell a lie and get found out later.

1359
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,000
It's always worse when they do that.

1360
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,480
I mean, on the one hand, I guess it comes down to his values, right?

1361
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,920
Cause like, he doesn't actually have to face any consequences of this.

1362
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,680
Like there's nothing I can do about it.

1363
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:09,840
If he is, if he is okay with this situation, then like, I guess more power to him.

1364
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,080
He, he, he, he did, he did what he wanted to do.

1365
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,080
He's living his best life and, and, and, and, you know, happy for him.

1366
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,280
But I, but I feel like he shouldn't be happy with it.

1367
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:28,240
And I feel like it, a rational person would see this outcome as a problem.

1368
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:35,480
And, and that problem did not exist before when he, when he was, whatever problem he

1369
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:40,200
might have imagined that like it was late or like it was like, you know, it was more

1370
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
work than he thought or something like that.

1371
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,960
Whatever problem may have been there was not, was not that big a deal, but like now it is

1372
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,960
a big deal now.

1373
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,560
Like what he, what he ended, the way he handled it is, is a, I don't know, to me, to me, it's

1374
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,280
like, it's bad.

1375
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,780
It's really fucking bad.

1376
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,320
It created a problem where basically none existed.

1377
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,440
The way that, the way that he chose to respond to whatever was stressing him out about it.

1378
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,440
Right.

1379
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,440
It's not rational.

1380
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,920
It's, it's, yeah.

1381
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:21,200
I, because I think of like, if I was in that situation where I knew I could see that the

1382
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,640
person was trying to get in contact with me, adding me on Twitter publicly.

1383
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,880
He definitely saw.

1384
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,880
He definitely saw it.

1385
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,640
There's no, there's no way he didn't.

1386
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,640
Like being aware of that, I would just feel bad all the time.

1387
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,640
I hope he does.

1388
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,880
He should, he should feel bad.

1389
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,400
He should feel bad about himself.

1390
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:43,960
This is not something that's like, okay, this is not something that, okay, I'm gonna, I'm

1391
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,080
gonna overstate it.

1392
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,080
I'm gonna overstate it.

1393
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,040
I was gonna say, this is not something a good person would do.

1394
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,880
I'm not saying this guy is like a terrible person in general, but this is, this is not

1395
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,160
a good thing to do.

1396
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,000
You should feel ashamed of yourself.

1397
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
In my opinion.

1398
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah.

1399
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,160
So I hope he feels bad about it.

1400
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,480
I don't know.

1401
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:13,960
I was tempted to, I was tempted to file like a PayPal complaint and like claw back the,

1402
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,600
the money, the like, you know, the first half that I had already paid him.

1403
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,640
Maybe I could have gotten it back.

1404
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,960
In the end, I decided that probably the best thing to do is like, just forget it.

1405
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,920
You know, he did, he did most of half of the work.

1406
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,120
So just whatever, just keep it, we'll just take what you got.

1407
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,360
So it's, and then we got, we got Kaijukun.

1408
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,520
I asked Kaijukun if he would like to complete the project.

1409
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,280
And he said, he said he would, he said he'd have it in six weeks.

1410
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:46,360
So we'll see about that.

1411
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,800
So yeah, I'm just out of out of spite, out of hurt feelings.

1412
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,400
I kind of wanted to like, no, give me my money back.

1413
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Your page is going to trash.

1414
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,000
You're not on the project anymore.

1415
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,120
But like practically consideration, it's like, well, but why, but like, that's such

1416
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,120
a waste though.

1417
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,680
Like, like whatever, whatever is where his drawings were good.

1418
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,760
The pages were good.

1419
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,440
I wish I wish he'd completed it because it would have looked really good.

1420
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,320
I'm sure Kaiju will also do a great job.

1421
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,640
But you know, whatever, whatever.

1422
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,640
So I'm mad.

1423
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,520
So a lot of things, so a lot of things made me mad this week, I guess, is the, is the

1424
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
theme.

1425
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
Yeah.

1426
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:35,120
One thing that didn't make me mad though was the crypto crash.

1427
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,880
That was pretty funny.

1428
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,880
Was there a crash?

1429
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,880
Yeah.

1430
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,880
Big one.

1431
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,000
Bitcoin dropped like 10% Ethereum dropped even more.

1432
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:54,640
Um, hold, actually, uh, something, uh, Milu in my discord, he messaged me today before

1433
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,800
I was awake.

1434
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:01,720
He said like, Ben, you've got that USDT and USDC in your, in your, in your Bitcoin wallet

1435
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,720
wallet.

1436
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,520
Uh, the gas fees are low.

1437
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,600
The gas fees are only $4 right now.

1438
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,600
You can transfer it out.

1439
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,840
I didn't see it until a few hours later.

1440
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,160
That was what I had to check before the PCP started.

1441
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,200
I didn't see it till a few hours later.

1442
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,920
And then he, and I checked, and by the time I checked, it was, it was like $30, which

1443
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,920
is lower than it's ever been.

1444
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,600
I've never seen it lower than like 60.

1445
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,560
So I was, I was tempted to go $30, but this, he said it was going to be like four.

1446
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,400
I may have just missed the window on that.

1447
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,400
So I don't know.

1448
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,400
Such a scam.

1449
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,560
I mean, the whole thing is a scam, but like the gas fees, it can never work.

1450
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,720
The aspect of it is just so stupid.

1451
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,720
It's useless.

1452
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,560
Like it will never, it can never see wide adoption because it's so cumbersome.

1453
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,560
It's terrible.

1454
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,440
Did you, did you see the, um, the video by Dan Olson?

1455
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,440
I did.

1456
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,440
I watched it yesterday.

1457
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,440
Okay.

1458
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:58,560
That's a good, I had been following his thread about, um, NFT discord servers on Twitter

1459
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,560
for a while.

1460
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,160
So I knew he was going to make a video.

1461
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,960
I've been looking forward to it.

1462
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,080
It's a great video.

1463
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,720
It made me afraid.

1464
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:15,320
Like maybe genuinely afraid of the future, uh, 10 out of 10, I just really appreciate

1465
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:23,440
like the, the things that like lots of people learning about NFTs, they see as somebody

1466
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,600
tweeting about the bad effects and they link to an article and then there's like a bunch

1467
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:33,600
of articles and it's like, it's hard to like remember all of the different facts and like

1468
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:40,040
to know whether what is, what is really the deal with all of this?

1469
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,320
Put all of the information all in a row that you could experience from one to the, to the,

1470
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:49,360
you know, from the beginning to the end, you're like, okay, now I get it.

1471
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,920
I get it.

1472
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:57,360
And even, you know, my hunches, my, my inklings, my, my thoughts based on some evidence, uh,

1473
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:02,680
have been shown to be true with all the evidence.

1474
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,680
They stink.

1475
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,680
Right.

1476
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,680
Yeah.

1477
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:11,080
Um, they're bad, they're bad in, they're just like a whole stack.

1478
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,760
They're bad in like every way and there's just like a whole stack of reasons with it.

1479
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,880
They're bad on top of bad.

1480
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,280
Like they're not only bad at what they set out to do, but also what they set out to do

1481
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,280
is horrifying.

1482
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,040
Um, it's, it's multi-layered.

1483
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,760
And what they actually end up doing is also horrifying.

1484
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,760
Right.

1485
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,880
And there's, they're bad.

1486
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,880
Yeah.

1487
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:37,160
Like people, people talk about like how they look really bad and like true.

1488
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,800
And also the environmental effects, yeah, true, but also like, you know, even more important

1489
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:48,160
than that is like, you know, the, you know, blockchain supremacy would be like a privacy

1490
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,160
nightmare.

1491
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:54,880
You know, it's consolidates power more effectively than traditional money does even.

1492
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:02,680
So that's really a nightmarish dystopian, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it was really interesting.

1493
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:08,320
This basically how it's the same system we have now where the rich get richer and the

1494
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:14,640
poor are like mistreated and taken advantage of and shoved around.

1495
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:18,960
But it's, it's the same, but in the digital realm and just sort of worse and worse and

1496
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,960
worse.

1497
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:26,640
Like people, people who need money, who, who, who are struggling, uh, get hit the hardest

1498
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:36,720
and it's sad that like, like they're made the butt of jokes, not like it's, I get, they

1499
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:44,520
should be made fun of for, for like the reasons of, of making NFTs look bad by, by exposing

1500
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,440
the bad stuff that they do.

1501
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,480
But a lot, but at the end of the day, a lot of them are just dupes, right?

1502
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,440
A lot of them are just, you know, unfortunate dupes who've like, they, they just, they're

1503
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,160
desperate and they're hoping that this is their big break and it isn't and they get

1504
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:05,160
fucked over and they have no money and they lost all of their savings and that's it.

1505
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,320
They're fucked and nothing can be done about it, at least in terms of like getting the

1506
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:12,400
money back because it's all blockchain stuff.

1507
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:17,680
It's all legal for that to be stolen from them.

1508
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:23,160
He was not the first one to express this sentiment, but I think Dan, at some point in the video,

1509
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,520
he, I'm paraphrasing, but he says like something like, like, like the vision of the vision

1510
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:33,680
of crypto is like the pitch for crypto and NFTs is like, get it on the ground floor.

1511
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:39,120
Like it's basically just like we can re remake capitalism, but like, but you get to be the

1512
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,120
boot, right?

1513
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:47,280
If you buy, if you buy in early, we'll still have a system wherein like, you know, inequality

1514
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:53,160
exists and is reinforced and, and boot stamping on a human face forever.

1515
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,920
But if you buy in, you can be the boot.

1516
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,640
You can be, you can be the boot stamping on other people.

1517
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:03,340
And it's like, well, sign, sign me up, I guess.

1518
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:08,280
If you've been stamped on, I get why you'd rather be the boot, of course.

1519
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,600
Uh, sure.

1520
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:15,840
So actually it's funny, funny timing.

1521
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:22,160
The crypto crash was happening as, uh, the I hate digi bro video was, was, was premiering.

1522
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:26,440
And, and, and, and wanted to, well, I saw one or two people in the live chat being like

1523
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,920
crypto crash, Bitcoin crash.

1524
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,280
And then I looked over to, and then I looked over at Kikko or whatever.

1525
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,560
And I saw like, yeah, line go down, line go down.

1526
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,400
It's like the biggest drop in like months, actually.

1527
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,680
Uh, so that was.

1528
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:44,960
Were she talking about Bitcoin in the, no, but I, but I was like, oh my God, Trixie.

1529
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,640
No, you gotta bring digi bro back.

1530
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,360
You gotta bring the market doesn't like this.

1531
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,360
You're killing Bitcoin.

1532
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,040
Uh, yeah.

1533
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,040
Very funny.

1534
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:59,240
Um, uh, yeah, I hope it, I hope it keeps going down.

1535
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,240
Obviously.

1536
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,880
Uh, who knows?

1537
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:07,000
I, obviously there's that nagging voice in my mind that's like, no, Ben, you gotta buy

1538
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,280
the dip.

1539
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,280
You gotta buy the dip, Ben.

1540
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,280
You can't do it.

1541
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,280
Ben.

1542
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,520
Well, listen, I'll, I'll repeat what I've said.

1543
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,160
You've said before, even if it was the worst thing to do, but it was beneficial.

1544
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,800
If I knew, if I knew that it's going to bounce and it's going to go up and it's going to

1545
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,000
go to the moon, I'm sorry, I would buy in.

1546
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

1547
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I would do it.

1548
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And I would cringe at you.

1549
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I know.

1550
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I know.

1551
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Like I currently do.

1552
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Yeah.

1553
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Okay.

1554
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Okay.

1555
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
All right.

1556
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,440
Uh, but there's, you know, people, I've seen some predictions that are like, oh no, it's

1557
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,960
going in a zigzag pattern.

1558
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,520
You ever see, okay.

1559
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,920
Can we just up, down, up, down?

1560
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,920
Yeah.

1561
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,920
Yeah.

1562
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,440
Cause it did a big spike and then it went down and then it did a big spike and then

1563
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,760
it went down and, um, people draw.

1564
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,960
Let me show you an image.

1565
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,960
People draw shit like this here.

1566
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,360
This is, this is a good example.

1567
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,120
Uh, let me see.

1568
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,120
Okay.

1569
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,120
Okay.

1570
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,120
Website uses cookies.

1571
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,120
That's fine.

1572
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:11,560
They'll take the graph, they'll take the graph, let me post, uh, the image here and they'll,

1573
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:17,120
and they'll, they'll isolate some points on the graph and then they'll draw some lines

1574
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,200
between them and then they'll be like, oh, see here, it's a pattern.

1575
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,160
Oh, it's forming a zigzag pattern, right?

1576
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:29,320
But like, and some, and some, like when you look at this, it, it looks like, oh yeah,

1577
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,120
you know, uh, it, it, oh, it went up and then it went down and then it went up and then

1578
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,960
it went down and they drew lines around it.

1579
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,560
So you can see where it's going to bounce like, oh, it's, it's going to bounce at wherever.

1580
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:46,600
But like, consider the, okay, just in this example, the bottom out, yeah, well, yeah,

1581
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,920
zoom out, but also the, the bottom line, like where did they decide to put the left end

1582
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,680
of the bottom line?

1583
01:32:54,680 --> 01:33:00,360
Could they not have put the bottom, the, the left end of the bottom line lower, right?

1584
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:05,080
And have the angle be steeper and still intersect the bounce point in the middle and then their

1585
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,520
prediction point for the bounce.

1586
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,800
Oh, well, no, I guess it's, I guess cause the top, the top angles line up too.

1587
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,800
Okay.

1588
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,800
So I mean, this, this looks pretty, this looks pretty clean, but the point is at the end

1589
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,680
of the day, it is arbitrary and people do this all the time and they're like, they, they

1590
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:21,160
isolate a little part of the graph and they draw lines and they're like, see, it's a trend.

1591
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:25,640
See, we can see where it's going to bounce and it's all, it's all just fucking drawing,

1592
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,360
drawing targets around arrows that you already shot.

1593
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,360
You know?

1594
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,360
Yes.

1595
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:34,600
And it like sometime and it, and it, and it proves true about as often as it proves

1596
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
not true.

1597
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,600
And it's like a stupid exercise in nothing, basically, it's, it's like, you can't predict

1598
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:48,000
the future with like, Oh, well, it's been doing this in the current state of the world

1599
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,120
for this amount of time.

1600
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,400
So all we need to do is make sure that the current state of the world is exactly the

1601
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,600
same and it'll happen again.

1602
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,600
I look at this graph.

1603
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,760
Like that could, like that it could ever happen that all these things are going to change

1604
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,920
randomly and you're not going to be able to know.

1605
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,920
Yes, exactly.

1606
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,920
That's exactly right.

1607
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,760
Things, things will never happen the exact same way twice.

1608
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,960
It just, it just doesn't happen.

1609
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,720
So it's, it's foolish to be like, look, it bounced.

1610
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,240
It's going to bounce again.

1611
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,680
I look, I look at this graph and it gives me FOMO like, Oh my God, it's going to hit

1612
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,240
the bounce point soon.

1613
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,400
If, if I don't buy it, I'm going to miss that.

1614
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,600
I'm going to miss the gains.

1615
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,400
But it's just not that simple.

1616
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,320
You can't, you just, you can't actually know these things.

1617
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:37,360
It could, it could just continue to go down and down and down below 20, below 10, maybe.

1618
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,280
You just don't know.

1619
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,680
You don't know until, until you have hindsight.

1620
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,640
I hate, I hate this shit.

1621
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,200
I hate looking at this shit because it's so confident.

1622
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,960
It's so like, no, look, I drew the line.

1623
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,320
No, you, you got to, you got to, you got to obey the line.

1624
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:55,120
And I'm like, maybe I should obey the line, but no, I'm just going to look at the, the

1625
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:59,080
same thing in content, like zoom out over a longer period of time.

1626
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:04,440
This could be like one bump in a different pattern that says it's, it's going to go down

1627
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,640
forever or like, or it's going to go down for like a hundred years and it's going to

1628
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,640
come up again.

1629
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:15,320
It's like, there's no, there's no metric, there's no way to decide what metric to use.

1630
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,440
It's just sort of what you hope will happen.

1631
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,360
I hope it'll start going up around here.

1632
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,200
I wonder if there's a patent that says it will.

1633
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:33,720
The market did not account for, uh, uh, Trixie denouncing Digi Bro and, and pot and bursting

1634
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:39,200
and bursting the crypto bubble with that announcement.

1635
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,560
It wasn't ready for it.

1636
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,920
They've thrown off all the models.

1637
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:49,880
Um, what else?

1638
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,880
What else?

1639
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,880
What else?

1640
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:56,560
Do I have any, uh, I guess that's everything on my, on my stupid list of things I wanted

1641
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,560
to say today.

1642
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,880
Yeah, I didn't have much to say today.

1643
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,680
I was too stupid.

1644
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,680
Okay.

1645
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,680
Watching videos.

1646
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,680
Sure.

1647
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,680
Sure.

1648
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,680
Got the beginning of the podcast.

1649
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,000
Um, I guess one thing, not really a topic, but I would like to do another heckles for

1650
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
shekels.

1651
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Yeah.

1652
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,600
You know, I, I've been meaning to bring that up.

1653
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,240
I think we should do undertale too.

1654
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,240
Undertale too?

1655
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,240
Oh, that.

1656
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,240
Yeah.

1657
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,240
Yeah.

1658
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,520
I think we should, I think we should actually do a heckles for shekels of undertale too.

1659
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,520
Maybe this week?

1660
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,520
Uh, yeah.

1661
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,520
You want to do it on this?

1662
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,520
I don't know when exactly.

1663
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,520
I'll be busy.

1664
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,520
You'll be busy.

1665
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,520
Okay.

1666
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,520
I'll be sort of busy.

1667
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,320
I mean, I, I'll have time for like a stream on one of the nights.

1668
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,920
Do you want to let me know when you want to do it?

1669
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,920
When you know?

1670
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:45,920
Um.

1671
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, you don't have to let me know right now.

1672
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,080
Yeah, I'll, I'll let you know.

1673
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,080
Okay.

1674
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,680
But yeah, I also want to do, we haven't done it.

1675
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:56,880
We haven't done one all month, uh, bit, bit cringe.

1676
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,240
Um, so you, I don't know, you want to do voicemails?

1677
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,240
Yeah.

1678
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,240
Sweet.

1679
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,640
You got them, you got them open?

1680
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:10,100
I will get them open.

1681
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:16,400
One thing I've been thinking about, and I probably have not acted on it this episode

1682
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,760
because I have not been thinking about it during this episode.

1683
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:26,880
But uh, I have been thinking, I have thought this before, but I think I would like to act

1684
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,240
on it sooner rather than later and actually do something about it this time.

1685
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:38,800
Uh, I don't like how often I say like, people have pointed it out before and it's true that

1686
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,760
many times when I'm speaking, I go, oh, it's like, like, you know, like, like, and uh,

1687
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,880
I think it's a bit excessive and I think I would maybe like to tone it down and I might

1688
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,880
have said this before.

1689
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,880
No, you just said it then.

1690
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,880
I know, I know.

1691
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,880
I know.

1692
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,880
Ugh.

1693
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,880
Yeah.

1694
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,880
Um, I don't know.

1695
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,880
I would like to turn it down.

1696
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,880
I would.

1697
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,880
Shut up.

1698
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,880
Prefer it to turn it down.

1699
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,880
Die, die, die, die.

1700
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,760
It would be, uh, in my best interests, it would be, uh, beneficial.

1701
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:09,640
I, I, it just, it, read a dictionary every now and, every now and then it occurs to me.

1702
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:16,680
I don't really like how much I say, like, and so I don't know, um, I, I don't really

1703
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:23,640
enjoy how much I shut up, um, so I don't know.

1704
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,400
I'm not saying, I'm not saying I'm gonna fix the problem.

1705
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,400
I am saying.

1706
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:33,240
I'm just saying it's another on the long list of things that make me mad.

1707
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,240
That's true.

1708
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:42,400
I am saying that I would like to not be like that anymore and, uh, maybe I'll, I, I don't

1709
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,400
know.

1710
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,120
I don't know if I can fix myself at this point.

1711
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,960
I mean, is it really a problem?

1712
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:54,520
I, I, in my opinion, if you, I don't like it, I don't like it is why it's, you don't

1713
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,520
like it.

1714
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,520
You don't enjoy it.

1715
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:08,520
How many times, um, yeah, I don't know, I don't know, whatever, um, like, it's okay.

1716
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,520
I just didn't think it's fine.

1717
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,560
It's, it's okay to do sometimes in moderation.

1718
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:22,600
I don't think it's something that I need to never do, but there, I've definitely heard

1719
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:29,280
myself speaking at times and been like, that's too many likes.

1720
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,360
It's, it's, uh, it's a verbal tick.

1721
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,240
You just need to think of something to replace it with.

1722
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:40,480
Um, yeah, like what, what I just did there, I go, um, lots of people do that.

1723
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,840
Some people just have nothing.

1724
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,480
They have like a silence.

1725
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:50,920
They, they, they leave silence when they don't have a word to say, which is something I've

1726
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:57,920
done sometimes and it means people think I've finished talking when I haven't.

1727
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,920
So I don't know, you, you, you could replace it with something you could, you could force

1728
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,760
yourself to like add nothing.

1729
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,600
I guess I could, I could make a conscious effort to replace it with something that I

1730
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,040
find more agreeable.

1731
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,640
I guess maybe that's one way to do it.

1732
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:17,080
I would have to think about what that would, like squash.

1733
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:21,720
No, no, um, all right.

1734
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:26,880
Do you want to, the first, the first voicemail is called fatty tuna.

1735
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:27,880
You got it?

1736
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,880
Yep.

1737
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,880
Okay.

1738
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,040
Uh, well three, two, one, let's jam.

1739
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:40,000
Speaking of stupid racist shit on the internet, the English cast for the dub of Nagatorosan

1740
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,680
got released and there was a shit storm because it turns out cast a black woman voice actors

1741
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:53,640
was gonna be black and people were saying stupid shit like Edward Toro, which I guess

1742
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,520
was actually kind of funny, but still, it fits a little too well, but then people were

1743
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
like, oh, she's not actually black.

1744
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,680
You didn't have to voice her with a black person.

1745
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,680
You idiots.

1746
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,680
Right.

1747
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:10,200
And it's like, does that mean Darth Vader's not black anymore?

1748
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,360
Darth Vader's not black.

1749
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,680
I mean, he is actually.

1750
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:21,560
These exact people will make some stupid excuse because of boomer bullshit, but I saw this.

1751
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,400
I saw this being posted.

1752
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,080
I've never seen Nagatoro, but I've seen the character.

1753
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,880
She's like tan.

1754
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,120
I don't, I think she's just kind of supposed to be a little bit darker skinned.

1755
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:36,680
Not, I don't think she's supposed to be like tan, like she's a beach bunny or anything

1756
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,680
like that.

1757
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,680
Uh, that's, yeah.

1758
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:47,680
You know, I cast a black woman and I saw one response that was like, you know, no, nobody

1759
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,800
gets mad when white people voice the male anime characters who are Japanese.

1760
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:57,680
So why is it a problem if a black voice is this girl is also Japanese?

1761
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:01,680
Oh, we only only only Japanese actors.

1762
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,680
No.

1763
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,680
I just hate black people.

1764
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,680
I'm sorry.

1765
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
I'm sorry.

1766
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,680
I'm not sorry.

1767
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,680
I'm not sorry.

1768
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,680
It's true.

1769
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,680
It's true.

1770
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,680
It's not good.

1771
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,680
Yeah.

1772
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,680
I was with anime fans.

1773
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,680
What is it with Japan?

1774
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,680
I'm a fan.

1775
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,680
Well, it's not just them, but I mean, it's not just them.

1776
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,680
But like, why is that?

1777
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,680
Like it's gamers too.

1778
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,680
It's gamers, Jerry.

1779
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:32,680
It's a, it's a certain type of disillusioned young, uh, internet like cracker.

1780
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,680
Just say it.

1781
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:34,680
Just say cracker.

1782
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:40,680
Uh, yeah, leads to those things.

1783
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,680
I don't know.

1784
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,680
I don't know.

1785
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:48,680
Like a whole like cycle of analysts, but I can see it happening and that's really bad.

1786
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,680
It sucks.

1787
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,680
I don't like it.

1788
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,680
Next voicemail is an image.

1789
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:56,680
Here it is.

1790
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,680
What is this?

1791
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,680
What's this?

1792
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:03,680
Oh, the father of the son, the Holy Spirit.

1793
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,680
Jesse.

1794
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,680
It's not yellow.

1795
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,680
Nate.

1796
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,680
Common as glasses aren't orange.

1797
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,680
Uh, this is Chris Chan.

1798
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,680
No, they are orange.

1799
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,680
Uh, they're not red.

1800
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,680
People draw them as red.

1801
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,680
No, no, people draw them as orange.

1802
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,680
Wait, because of that one scene where he's like points to the heavens and there, it's

1803
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,680
like the orange light is makes them look orange, but other places they're red.

1804
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:31,680
You're right.

1805
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,680
People misunderstand.

1806
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,680
You are correct.

1807
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
You are correct.

1808
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,680
I got missed.

1809
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:42,680
What, I don't know what, what, what can I say about this image, but I agree.

1810
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,680
It's true.

1811
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:47,680
It's just, it's just true.

1812
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:54,680
Um, you know, maybe we should like, maybe we should like retweet some of these like on

1813
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,680
the two, on the PCP account.

1814
01:43:55,680 --> 01:44:00,680
It occurred to me the other day, like we could, I could like post some of these like funny

1815
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:04,680
voice mail parts like on the Twitter.

1816
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,680
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,680
Like why not?

1818
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,680
Why haven't, so maybe I'll do something with that.

1819
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:14,680
Yeah, maybe make a tweet and then like which episodes it's featured in or something.

1820
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:15,680
Yeah.

1821
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,680
Yeah, maybe.

1822
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:17,680
Um, okay.

1823
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,680
Another image.

1824
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,680
Oh God.

1825
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,680
This could be you.

1826
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:27,680
If you go keto.

1827
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,680
Got all the girls looking at you.

1828
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,680
Yeah.

1829
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
Meanwhile.

1830
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,680
You're completely butt naked.

1831
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,680
Sure.

1832
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,680
Meanwhile at big carb.

1833
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Unfortunately, this is not me because, uh, I haven't worked out in almost a month because

1834
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:52,680
first I got COVID and then after I recovered, uh, the, um, there were, there were people

1835
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:57,680
at the, um, at the, the, the Munchie house.

1836
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:01,680
They were busy and we didn't, we didn't work out like all through January.

1837
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:07,680
So, uh, this is not me, but it could still perhaps one day.

1838
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,680
What, what is going on in big carb?

1839
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,680
There's a person crying.

1840
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,680
There's a person carrying a box.

1841
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,680
Line go down.

1842
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,680
In the background.

1843
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,680
Line go down.

1844
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:19,680
Like their businesses, their businesses, uh, they've lost everything.

1845
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:25,680
They're just like unreasonably upset or like reasonably upset because carbohydrates rule

1846
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,680
their lives.

1847
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,680
Yeah.

1848
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,680
Yeah.

1849
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,680
Yeah.

1850
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:34,680
They, they've got more than enough reason to be.

1851
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:38,680
I would be doing the exact same thing if I were, they're seething.

1852
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,680
You ask what they're doing.

1853
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,680
They're seething and molding and coping.

1854
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,680
This guy's mouth is disgusting.

1855
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,680
His flat gums with his little nub teeth.

1856
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,680
That's what happens when you eat bread.

1857
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,680
That is.

1858
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,680
That's true.

1859
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,680
Man, I gotta go to the dentist.

1860
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:02,680
I told myself, I told, shit, I told, I told myself, uh, okay, it's, it's new year.

1861
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:07,680
I'm going to finish up a Phantom's Revenge and then I'll finally make a dentist appointment.

1862
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,680
Uh, and it's, it's been a whole.

1863
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,680
It's your, your, your victory lap.

1864
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,680
Kinda.

1865
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,680
I thought it would be like two weeks, but it's been three weeks.

1866
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,680
January is almost over and I'm still like, oh, gotta actually draw the shit.

1867
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,680
So, uh, I gotta, I gotta actually do it.

1868
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,680
Uh, I like these cute girls.

1869
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:26,680
I like these cute girls.

1870
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,680
They're not even all looking at you.

1871
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,680
The one on the top left is looking at the pink one.

1872
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:32,680
That's okay.

1873
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,680
That's true.

1874
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,680
Well, that's fine.

1875
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,680
That's fine.

1876
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,680
Um, I don't like the drooling one actually.

1877
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,680
She can, she can leave.

1878
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,680
The other ones are good.

1879
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,680
Uh, okay.

1880
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,680
This is like that panel of the Vapors.

1881
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,680
This is like that panel of the Vapors where Vincent is imagining himself holding infinite

1882
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:55,680
jests and all the girls are gazing at him in awe.

1883
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,680
I was just imagining if Vincent was doing this pose naked.

1884
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,680
This could be.

1885
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:00,680
Imagination.

1886
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,680
Uh, Vincent would never go keto.

1887
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,680
Maybe he would.

1888
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,680
I don't know.

1889
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:11,680
Um, anyway, uh, which was that, um, uh, shit.

1890
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,680
Which image was this?

1891
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,680
This was, okay.

1892
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:14,680
So the next page.

1893
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:17,680
The next one is, the next one is called the new, it's called New DeVoo.

1894
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,680
Three, two, one, go.

1895
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,680
Hey, you see that New DeVoo video?

1896
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,680
Yeah.

1897
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,680
We talked about it.

1898
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,680
It was pretty good.

1899
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,680
Whatever.

1900
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,680
Who cares?

1901
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,680
Shut up.

1902
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,680
We talked about it last time.

1903
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,680
It was pretty good.

1904
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,680
Oh my God.

1905
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,680
Oh my God.

1906
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,680
It was a video.

1907
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:36,680
Shut up.

1908
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,680
Fuck you.

1909
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,680
Fuck you.

1910
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,680
I don't want to hear about the New DeVoo video.

1911
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:49,680
Um, uh, there was too much of a fucking coward to call Trixie out for like fucking, uh,

1912
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,680
mistreating her.

1913
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:51,680
So she's dead to me.

1914
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,680
She's fucking dead to me.

1915
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,680
I talked about this last episode.

1916
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,680
I don't have to go into it again.

1917
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,680
Um, that's it.

1918
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,680
Okay.

1919
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:05,680
Next one is called, uh, for Jess fans out of the loop.

1920
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,680
Three, two, one, go.

1921
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,680
So with all the recent bleep in the weeb talk, uh, I've seen a lot of people just like talking

1922
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:18,680
about Jesse and like asking like, oh, what's Jesse doing?

1923
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,680
Like, uh, Jesse kind of just left.

1924
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:23,680
Um, Jesse is still making content.

1925
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,680
He's just like patron exclusive now.

1926
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,680
Okay.

1927
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:32,680
Has been for like, uh, like a year or two now, like two years now.

1928
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,680
I heard he does Let's Plays.

1929
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:37,680
I heard he plays video games and posts videos of it.

1930
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:41,680
He makes like three to five like videos a month.

1931
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:42,680
Amazing.

1932
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,680
Releases them at the end of the month on Patreon.

1933
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,680
It's incredible.

1934
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:50,680
So, uh, if you want to support Jesse, uh, you know, throw a dollar his way.

1935
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,680
Patreon.com slash, unless Jess.

1936
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,680
Sam, fuck off.

1937
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,680
Don't call us a patron for a little while.

1938
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:06,680
And he does do the Let's Plays like live stream super cuts where he like cuts down a live

1939
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,680
stream he did, um, makes it easier to watch.

1940
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,680
And then there's like a few like weirdo like vlogs.

1941
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:17,680
He did one where he like had a bunch of alcohol and he went into the middle of the woods during

1942
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:22,680
COVID because that's the only place that's safe where no one can get him.

1943
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:29,680
Some of that stuff's quite good, but I, uh, ultimately felt like it wasn't worth my money.

1944
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,680
I don't.

1945
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,680
Maybe he's made some really good videos though.

1946
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,680
I'm not sure.

1947
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:34,680
I don't.

1948
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,680
I'll believe it when I see it.

1949
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:37,680
I don't want to be advertised to you on my show.

1950
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,680
Fuck off, voicemailer.

1951
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:47,680
Um, next one is, uh, a vocaru link.

1952
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,680
Yep.

1953
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,680
Uh, okay.

1954
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,680
All right.

1955
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,680
Here we go.

1956
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,680
Uh, this is called Rand, Rand, Rand in, okay.

1957
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,680
Three, two, one, go.

1958
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:03,680
Ugh, you ever go back and, uh, listen to old PCP episodes?

1959
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,680
No.

1960
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:14,680
Here Nate, go on weird, I know, Rand, Rand, and like, just say a whole bunch of like

1961
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:20,680
cringy, notarian, while simultaneous.

1962
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:26,680
He dreaming of living in, uh, you know, post scarcity.

1963
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,680
Communism was like, I don't know.

1964
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,680
What?

1965
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,680
I'm gonna be like Jordan, your solution.

1966
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:40,680
I'm like, still think this is the smoke I ever...

1967
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:47,680
What a fucking door.

1968
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:58,680
Uh, yeah.

1969
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:11,680
Yeah, true.

1970
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,680
That was pretty groovy.

1971
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,680
Uh, true also?

1972
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,680
I would say it's true.

1973
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:22,680
Because he was talking about things that literally happened.

1974
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:27,680
I would agree with that assessment.

1975
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,680
Uh, cool.

1976
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:34,680
Um, next one is called, old unused voicemail, haha.

1977
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:38,680
Uh, that's another vocaru.

1978
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,680
All right.

1979
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,680
Uh, all right.

1980
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:44,680
Three, two, one, go.

1981
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,680
Hello, it is me, the baby boy.

1982
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,680
I have a question for Ben St.

1983
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,680
Will you abort me?

1984
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,680
I am only two years old.

1985
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,680
My brain is not fully developed.

1986
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,680
A chimpanzee can outthink me.

1987
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,680
Put me in a blender.

1988
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1989
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1990
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:08,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1991
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1992
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:13,680
You know you want to.

1993
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,680
You know you need to.

1994
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1995
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,680
Put the baby in a blender.

1996
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,680
What does this remind me of?

1997
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:27,680
Um, is it that song we just heard in the last voicemail?

1998
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:28,680
No, no, no.

1999
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,680
I mean, it's probably the same guy.

2000
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:33,680
But it's like some, something about that, that vocal,

2001
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,680
would the baby in the blender in that sort of crunched,

2002
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,680
distorted voice.

2003
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:42,680
But I think that should probably be this week's intro music.

2004
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,680
I liked it a lot.

2005
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,680
That was quality.

2006
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,680
Very, very drool.

2007
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:52,680
And I mean, I would definitely kill a chimpanzee with no hesitation.

2008
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:56,680
So a two-year-old child would be no problem.

2009
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:00,680
No sweat.

2010
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,680
Yeah.

2011
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,680
All right.

2012
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,680
Next, next one is Janess.

2013
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,680
Three, two, one, go.

2014
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,680
If you haven't heard the announcement yet,

2015
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:11,680
Scott Pilgrim is gaining anime adaptation.

2016
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,680
And the author is going to be the executive producer on the project.

2017
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,680
I heard about.

2018
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,680
It's made me wonder,

2019
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:23,680
since Ben, your comic style was mainly influenced by Scott Pilgrim.

2020
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,680
Oh, mainly.

2021
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:29,680
How would you feel if your comics were adapted into an anime format?

2022
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:34,680
And how would you feel about Japanese voice actors

2023
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,680
dubbing the creative characters?

2024
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:43,680
I would be excited because it would make me a lot of money.

2025
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,680
That's my answer to both of those questions.

2026
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:47,680
It would be cool.

2027
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,680
It would be awesome.

2028
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,680
It would be cool.

2029
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,680
I'd make a lot of money.

2030
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:51,680
I'd get a lot of exposure.

2031
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,680
It would be great.

2032
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,680
When they say anime adaptation,

2033
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,680
do they mean like anime, like Japan?

2034
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:02,680
Or do they mean like a cartoon show?

2035
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:04,680
Air in Japan.

2036
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,680
I don't know.

2037
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,680
I did see it was getting a cartoon or whatever.

2038
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:13,680
Scott Pilgrim anime.

2039
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,680
Okay, a Scott Pilgrim anime series is coming to Netflix.

2040
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:21,680
Netflix is turning Scott Pilgrim into an anime.

2041
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:27,680
I'm not seeing any promotional images.

2042
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,680
They have to mean.

2043
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:34,680
There's no way they're going to make it look like an anime.

2044
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:38,680
It has to have the style, the recognizable style.

2045
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,680
It has to.

2046
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:45,680
It would be funny if it was exclusively in Japanese.

2047
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,680
Like a weeb move.

2048
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:52,680
Because Scott Pilgrim is kind of a nerd and that would be a funny joke.

2049
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,680
It would be kind of funny.

2050
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,680
I don't know.

2051
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,680
Whatever.

2052
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:03,680
Okay, next voicemail is banana.

2053
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,680
3, 2, 1, go.

2054
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:10,680
Why isn't Eleazar a guest?

2055
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:13,680
Because they're too busy editing.

2056
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,680
Well, I don't know.

2057
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:16,680
There's no reason they couldn't be.

2058
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:19,680
What would he want to talk about?

2059
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:25,680
If he asked and he wanted to, I wouldn't be against it.

2060
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:30,680
But like, you know.

2061
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,680
Better question.

2062
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,680
Why do you want him to be a guest?

2063
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:38,680
What's your problem?

2064
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:42,680
Yeah, fuck you.

2065
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:46,680
Next voicemail is called go on the Dug Zone.

2066
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,680
3, 2, 1, go.

2067
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,680
Go on the Dug Zone.

2068
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:52,680
I think it would be neat.

2069
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:56,680
The Dug Zone is the podcast where they...

2070
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:00,680
something, something, Dug Walker.

2071
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:02,680
Okay.

2072
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,680
What do they do there?

2073
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:04,680
Do they say Dug Walker's...

2074
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,680
I'll go on the Dug Zone.

2075
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:07,680
Are they big?

2076
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,680
I don't think they're that big.

2077
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,680
Dug Zone podcast.

2078
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:17,680
I mean, I have some...

2079
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,680
The Dug Zone cast on Twitter.

2080
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,680
They have 38 followers on Twitter.

2081
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,680
That's fine.

2082
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:27,680
I'd go on the Dug Zone, I guess.

2083
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,680
If they wanted me to.

2084
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:32,680
I'm not against it.

2085
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:35,680
Okay.

2086
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:39,680
Next voicemail is called Plans for Episode 300.

2087
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,680
And I just got to say,

2088
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:45,680
I see that this voicemail is a minute and 13 seconds long.

2089
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:50,680
And from the title, I feel like maybe I've got the gist of what the question is.

2090
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,680
Right.

2091
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,680
But I'll give it a chance.

2092
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,680
Okay.

2093
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,680
Three, two, one, go.

2094
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:02,680
So with Episode 300 on the way, are you like planning anything?

2095
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:05,680
Like getting any like special guests?

2096
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:07,680
That took five seconds.

2097
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,680
Or is it just going to be like a normal episode?

2098
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:20,680
Because I think it'd be cool if some like new member or something was like announced.

2099
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:21,680
I don't know.

2100
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:24,680
Gamer's Tavern as a member would be pretty cool.

2101
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:27,680
I mean, he's already been on the podcast more times than Jeff too.

2102
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:30,680
I can't tell if this is a joke or something.

2103
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:36,680
No, having other like previous guests on like Minerva or Cybershell would be pretty cool.

2104
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:41,680
I think it'd be neat if Davoo ever got on.

2105
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,680
At least one more time.

2106
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:49,680
I think Davoo has quite a lot in common with the current PCP lineup as it is right now.

2107
01:57:49,680 --> 01:58:05,680
Seeing as both Ben and Davoo are game devs right now and Davoo and Gibbo are women.

2108
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:09,680
Got to have them women on the show.

2109
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,680
Okay, bye.

2110
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:17,680
No, short answer, no, I don't have any plans for 300.

2111
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:20,680
What are we on like 270, 298?

2112
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,680
Remember like 290 something.

2113
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,680
It's very close.

2114
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:25,680
Right?

2115
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,680
I don't know.

2116
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,680
I don't know what to do for 300.

2117
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:35,680
We'll just say to all the guests, hey, as many guests are interested, we're doing the episode 300.

2118
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:36,680
Wanna come?

2119
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,680
And then they'll be like, no, it'll just be us.

2120
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:45,680
You know what?

2121
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:50,680
Yeah, maybe we should do a get like a former guest extravaganza.

2122
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:51,680
I don't know.

2123
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,680
I don't know who...

2124
01:58:53,680 --> 01:59:00,680
I mean, I'd like it to be a larger affair than just the two of us and we have regulars that like coming on.

2125
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,680
I think Cybershell, it would be fun to have Cybershell on.

2126
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:08,680
To Snaker was pretty fun, maybe we could have him back on.

2127
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:09,680
Yeah.

2128
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:11,680
Who did you just say?

2129
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:12,680
Simsie.

2130
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,680
Simsie, yeah, Simsie's cool.

2131
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,680
We'd get Kazi, maybe.

2132
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,680
Sure.

2133
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,680
Can we get Kazi?

2134
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:20,680
Can we get Kazi?

2135
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:25,680
Can we afford them?

2136
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:28,680
I'm trying to think, I mean, who else?

2137
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:34,680
I mean, if we could have like 100 people on, but like that wouldn't work.

2138
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:38,680
We just send out like, oh, it's a big episode and like see if anyone's interested.

2139
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:42,680
If there's too many people interested, we'll have to like start saying no.

2140
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:44,680
Or like stagger it out.

2141
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:46,680
Like people come in for a bit.

2142
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,680
I don't know.

2143
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:50,680
I don't expect it to be like an overwhelming too many guests moment.

2144
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,680
Probably not.

2145
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:58,680
I mean, I'm looking through the past guests list right now.

2146
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:01,680
Does anyone stand out to me?

2147
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,680
Jim Storm Dancer.

2148
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:04,680
Jim Storm Dancer.

2149
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,680
He unfollowed me on Twitter.

2150
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:09,680
I'm assuming it was not for any like reason.

2151
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,680
He probably was just like, what do I need to follow this guy for?

2152
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,680
That made me a little sad.

2153
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,680
I guess I can ask Mary.

2154
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:18,680
I don't know.

2155
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,680
Can I ask Mary whether to be on again?

2156
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:22,680
Haven't had him on.

2157
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,680
Dude, you know who'd be a good guest?

2158
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:25,680
Tom?

2159
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,680
No.

2160
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,680
Can we get Tom?

2161
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:33,680
Honestly, if Devu wanted to come on as a guest, I guess for episode 300, it would be fine.

2162
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:37,680
Like I'm not actually like that opposed to it or whatever.

2163
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,680
I don't actually care that much.

2164
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:46,680
I might have sounded a little too serious before.

2165
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,680
I don't know.

2166
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,680
I guess we could ask Minerva.

2167
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,680
I don't know.

2168
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:57,680
I don't know if she'd be interested.

2169
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,680
Remember low art?

2170
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:01,680
We had low art on one time.

2171
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:05,680
I haven't talked to him in a long time.

2172
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:06,680
I don't know.

2173
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,680
FitMC.

2174
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:11,680
FitMC, I mean, he was more of an eight friend.

2175
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,680
I never really spoke to him on my own time.

2176
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:19,680
So I don't know if it would be weird to invite him back on.

2177
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:21,680
What a fucking nightmare.

2178
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:22,680
What a hassle.

2179
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,680
Oh god.

2180
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,680
Headphones fell out again.

2181
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:30,680
There's nothing worse than running a podcast.

2182
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:31,680
Yeah.

2183
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,680
We should stop immediately.

2184
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:40,680
I stop at 299.

2185
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:42,680
I mean, whatever.

2186
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,680
It's a podcast.

2187
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,680
It's a podcast.

2188
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:46,680
It doesn't have to be special.

2189
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,680
But 300 is like a lot of episodes.

2190
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:52,680
That's too many fucking episodes.

2191
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,680
All right.

2192
02:01:54,680 --> 02:02:01,680
Next one is called X2 321 Go.

2193
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:08,680
He will be here in two weeks.

2194
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:12,680
Oh, it's counting down to 300.

2195
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,680
I just put it together.

2196
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:14,680
I just put it together.

2197
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,680
This must be counting down to 200.

2198
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,680
Oh my god.

2199
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:21,680
Maybe it's X minus 2.

2200
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:23,680
Oh, I've been pronouncing it as like X2.

2201
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:26,680
But maybe it's like X minus 2.

2202
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,680
Like it's minus.

2203
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:28,680
Okay.

2204
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:33,680
Well, oh boy.

2205
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:35,680
I wonder what it's going to be.

2206
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,680
I wonder what it's going to be.

2207
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:38,680
Or who it's going to be.

2208
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:44,680
Next one is called Benz trans takes 321 Go.

2209
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,680
Benz is a trans woman because she identifies as one.

2210
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,680
And I agree.

2211
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,680
Okay.

2212
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:56,680
Thank you for the voice.

2213
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:57,680
Yeah.

2214
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,680
Yeah.

2215
02:02:58,680 --> 02:02:59,680
Yeah.

2216
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:00,680
Okay.

2217
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,680
Next one.

2218
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:03,680
Oh god.

2219
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,680
It's called Kyle.

2220
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,680
It's Kyle and funny man.

2221
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:07,680
Episode three parentheses.

2222
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:11,680
Actually dramatic and emotional.

2223
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:15,680
Three, two, one, go.

2224
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,680
One man's Kyle.

2225
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:21,680
The other is a funny man's Kyle and funny man in space.

2226
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:22,680
Okay.

2227
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,680
Enough fucking jokes.

2228
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:25,680
This show has been going on for a while.

2229
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:27,680
There are a bunch of iconic characters.

2230
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,680
But now this is like the series episode.

2231
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:31,680
We're going to show that we can do fucking funny,

2232
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,680
referential funny humors as well.

2233
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:36,680
But now we're doing fucking sweet dramatic shit.

2234
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,680
You're going to literally fucking cry at this episode.

2235
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:39,680
Finally emotional.

2236
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:42,680
These characters you've come to love over the crazy adventures

2237
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,680
they've had.

2238
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,680
They're going to do some fucking hard shit right now.

2239
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:46,680
Okay.

2240
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,680
Get fucking ready.

2241
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:50,680
Funny man.

2242
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:52,680
What are you doing?

2243
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:53,680
You stopped the guard.

2244
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:55,680
Now you just got a...

2245
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:58,680
Why are you putting a gun in his head?

2246
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,680
I don't understand.

2247
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:01,680
Kyle.

2248
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,680
This man.

2249
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,680
He killed my wife.

2250
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:09,680
My tragic backstory.

2251
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,680
Funny man.

2252
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,680
No.

2253
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:14,680
Revenge and hate just leads to more revenge and hate.

2254
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,680
Somebody will come to avenge him.

2255
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,680
No funny man.

2256
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:18,680
Spite and revenge are good.

2257
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:24,680
I must avenge my wife and all my village that got killed by this man.

2258
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:27,680
Funny man.

2259
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,680
Oh my God.

2260
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,680
Funny man.

2261
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,680
I can't believe you did a holy shit.

2262
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,680
But guys, this series can do fucking everything.

2263
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,680
Funny.

2264
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,680
We do series.

2265
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,680
You literally cry that holy shit.

2266
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,680
Oh my God.

2267
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:42,680
This series is the best because we can do literally everything.

2268
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,680
Get excited for more.

2269
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:46,680
I'm already there.

2270
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,680
I'm already there.

2271
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:48,680
You have me.

2272
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,680
You have a captive audience.

2273
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:52,680
I'm on the edge of my seat.

2274
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,680
That was...

2275
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:54,680
I don't know.

2276
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:55,680
Too beautiful for words.

2277
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,680
I didn't cry enough.

2278
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:59,680
It should have been more...

2279
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:00,680
I think I'm...

2280
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,680
More crying.

2281
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,680
More screaming.

2282
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,680
I think I'm still processing.

2283
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,680
I'm still processing what happened.

2284
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:09,680
The tears will come later after the shock wears off, I think.

2285
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:11,680
Next voicemail.

2286
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,680
Hold on.

2287
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:14,680
Did I download that one?

2288
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:15,680
No, I didn't.

2289
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,680
Okay.

2290
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,680
I'm trying to download these as I go.

2291
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:19,680
Okay.

2292
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,680
Next one is called Yeah.

2293
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,680
Three, two, one, go.

2294
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,680
I have some steam issues.

2295
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:28,680
I think it stems from my childhood.

2296
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,680
Growing up and normal reading from my parents would be like...

2297
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:35,680
Be like your siblings more.

2298
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:38,680
I'm an only child.

2299
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:41,680
One time someone shot up my car on my way home.

2300
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:46,680
My parents just said good.

2301
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:50,680
Went to the DMV the other day.

2302
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,680
When they asked me if I liked my picture.

2303
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:56,680
I was like, oh, it's kind of bad, isn't it?

2304
02:05:56,680 --> 02:06:01,680
And she just looked at me and said, that's what you look like.

2305
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:07,680
I was just like, yeah.

2306
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:12,680
I'm really sorry to hear that.

2307
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:15,680
So your car got shot for the holes?

2308
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,680
Yeah.

2309
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,680
Was that the second part?

2310
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,680
Yeah, just bullets.

2311
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,680
And then they kind of said good.

2312
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:21,680
Good.

2313
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:25,680
I'm glad that happened.

2314
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:26,680
Yeah.

2315
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:27,680
Yeah, okay.

2316
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,680
I like how understated it is.

2317
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:33,680
If you want to crank it even harder, it'd be like, I hoped you...

2318
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:36,680
That sucks because I hoped a bullet would have killed you.

2319
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:38,680
But no, they just like the bullets.

2320
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:40,680
There were bullets flying at them.

2321
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,680
They nodded.

2322
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:43,680
That's just average slide.

2323
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:44,680
It's just good.

2324
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,680
That's good.

2325
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,680
I like this is happening.

2326
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:49,680
Next one.

2327
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:50,680
The download I did.

2328
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,680
Next one is called testing one, two, three.

2329
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,680
Oh, like that My Little Pony episode.

2330
02:06:54,680 --> 02:07:02,680
Three, two, one, go.

2331
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:03,680
Yeah.

2332
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,680
Damn.

2333
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:05,680
That is what they do.

2334
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:06,680
Test successful.

2335
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,680
It's so funny because it's true.

2336
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:09,680
Test successful.

2337
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:12,680
Now you can send a voicemail.

2338
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:13,680
Okay.

2339
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:16,680
Next one is called Ben St.

2340
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:23,680
Three, two, one, go.

2341
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:24,680
Yeah.

2342
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,680
True.

2343
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:29,680
Next one is called comrade Nikolia.

2344
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:32,680
Three two one, go.

2345
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:35,680
Nikolai looked for vodka.

2346
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,680
Nikolai had a lot of vodka.

2347
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,680
No.

2348
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:40,680
You know, don't feel too good.

2349
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,680
I think he spelled Nikolai wrong.

2350
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:44,680
If you might die without vodka,

2351
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:50,680
Nikolai here comrade Ben St. had vodka.

2352
02:07:50,680 --> 02:08:07,000
I do enjoy the occasional, uh, the occasional, uh, nip of, uh, of, uh, potato spirits.

2353
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
It's true.

2354
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,920
Uh, my Slavic heritage, uh, just to blame, I suppose.

2355
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,160
Uh, I don't have any on me, man.

2356
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:17,160
I'm sorry.

2357
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:21,160
What if you could have, like, vodka-flavoured potato chips?

2358
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,160
God.

2359
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,160
Jesus.

2360
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:27,160
God.

2361
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,160
Can I, can I met?

2362
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,160
Ugh.

2363
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,160
Ugh.

2364
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,160
No, thank you.

2365
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,160
Uh, you just dip him, why not just dip him in rubbing alcohol, if you want.

2366
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:41,160
Uh, that, that's what you're looking for.

2367
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:44,160
Okay, next one is called Wong Chan.

2368
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,160
Three, two, one, go.

2369
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,160
Doing great.

2370
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:02,160
Uh, man.

2371
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,160
I'm, I'm alright.

2372
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,160
Doing good.

2373
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,160
How are you?

2374
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:09,160
Look forward to hearing your next voicemail when you tell me how, how you are.

2375
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:11,160
I'm gonna have a little backing for it.

2376
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:12,160
Let's be pen pals.

2377
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,160
Be voicemail pen pals.

2378
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:16,160
One, one sentence at a time.

2379
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:22,160
Uh, alright, uh, gotta check my numbers.

2380
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:25,160
Okay, uh, next one is Hi Ben.

2381
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:29,160
From Ben is not a saint for 2069 at hotmail.com.

2382
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:32,160
Three, two, one, go.

2383
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,160
Hey, where the fuck is Tom?

2384
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:35,160
Is he gonna come back on the channel sometime soon?

2385
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:36,160
I don't know.

2386
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:40,160
If he's not, I'm gonna dislike every video you guys have.

2387
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:41,160
Alright.

2388
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,160
Also Ben, you're kidding.

2389
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:43,160
Oh my God.

2390
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:44,160
Uh, yeah.

2391
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:45,160
Yeah.

2392
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,160
Yeah, you got me.

2393
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:51,160
Um, next, uh, Tom said, okay, talking about the, the, the, the, the, the Trixie vid, the

2394
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:54,160
I hate digipro vid, uh, Tom commented on Twitter.

2395
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:59,160
He mentioned that like, he mentioned the fact that like she seems to have forgotten that

2396
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:01,160
I am games ever happened.

2397
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:06,160
And he said something about whatever, whatever.

2398
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:09,160
The point was it came up that like he's rarely on the PCP.

2399
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:15,160
And he said, uh, oh, the time change because we record earlier in the mornings now.

2400
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:18,160
And I said, well, you, you know, you approved the change.

2401
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:22,160
Like I asked everyone if we were okay with the change and he was like, he said, I underestimated

2402
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,160
my abilities.

2403
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:27,160
So I don't know, maybe he would want, I'm not sure.

2404
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:31,160
Cause he, I think if he wanted to be on the show, he could, he could just, he could just

2405
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:32,160
say like, can we do it later?

2406
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:37,160
I think, I mean, I think he's just doing other stuff and it's not his priority right now.

2407
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:43,160
I don't think it's actually like, oh, if we just, we need to change the, the schedule

2408
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,160
back so he can be on more.

2409
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:48,160
Although if he wanted to, we could totally do that.

2410
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:53,160
Uh, you know, yeah, that's the, that's the situation.

2411
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:58,160
That's why he says, but like, I don't know if he actually wants us to do anything about

2412
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:59,160
it.

2413
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:00,160
It seems like not.

2414
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:03,160
If you didn't say he wanted anything to happen with that.

2415
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:08,160
So I don't know.

2416
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:13,160
Let me know in the comments, uh, what you think about that.

2417
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:15,160
Next voicemail.

2418
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:19,160
YouTube swearing arc to everybody's favorite storyline.

2419
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:22,160
Three, two, one, go.

2420
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,160
Hello.

2421
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:30,160
Justy dumps here here to update you on everybody's favorite PCP voicemail storyline, which is

2422
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:34,160
YouTube censorship arc that is happening to me, uh, IRL.

2423
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:41,160
So last week I sent a voicemail being all like, yeah, uh, why are my lyrics getting censored

2424
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:43,160
in the comments?

2425
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:44,160
Why can't I use that?

2426
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:48,160
Oh, you posted a comment saying you, you'll reply to yourself with a swear.

2427
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:51,160
I swear in the comments again, it's going to be freaking cool.

2428
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:55,160
I'm going to write a comment and then in the reply, I'm going to just write like fuck.

2429
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:56,160
Yeah.

2430
02:11:57,160 --> 02:12:01,160
That comment got, uh, deleted and censored.

2431
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:08,160
And I was like, okay, uh, justification to my worldview, but then right above me, some

2432
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:14,160
guy just simply named Jonathan writes the comment, test fuck.

2433
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:15,160
Huh.

2434
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,160
What?

2435
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,160
Why, why is he allowed to swear?

2436
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:24,160
And believe me, I tried like using multiple different accounts on my fucking sock puppets

2437
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:26,160
that I used to hack Hillary Clinton.

2438
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:27,160
I used them all.

2439
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:33,160
I made a new account, a new Google plus account just to fucking do a comment on multiple different

2440
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:39,160
videos, not just PCP, just writing a simple, uh, swear word like fuck or shit.

2441
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:45,160
And every single time the YouTube would get deleted, but some, for some reason, somebody

2442
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:46,160
has the privilege to swear.

2443
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,160
Uh, and what's the deal with that?

2444
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,160
That sucks.

2445
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,160
Now I gotta pee.

2446
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,160
Okay.

2447
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:52,160
Bye.

2448
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:53,160
Um, okay.

2449
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:54,160
Yeah.

2450
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:59,160
There was the, the, the comment that he left, uh, saying in replies to this, I will swear.

2451
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:03,160
And if there are no replies, that means YouTube is censoring me and there are no replies.

2452
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:04,160
I didn't see any.

2453
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:09,160
This is, um, uh, hold on, uh, pro crass news pot.

2454
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:11,160
I'm googling our own podcasts.

2455
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:18,160
Uh, where is, no, I wanted to check the latest episode.

2456
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:23,160
This is the, this is the same, this is the same guy who did a bunch of the songs.

2457
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:24,160
Yes.

2458
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:25,160
Songs.

2459
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:28,160
His name is Mutu, Mutu Sandu Mutu Sandu.

2460
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,160
Um, yeah.

2461
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:30,160
I saw the comment.

2462
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:33,160
I, I faved it, uh, last night, I think.

2463
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:34,160
And okay.

2464
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:39,160
Well, I was going to say maybe the problem is that your accounts are too new.

2465
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:45,160
Like maybe, maybe even your main account is like too new that like YouTube doesn't give

2466
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,160
it, like, doesn't trust it or something.

2467
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:51,160
That, but that's probably only the case if like your main account was like recently made,

2468
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,160
which it probably wasn't.

2469
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,160
So I don't know.

2470
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,160
Yeah.

2471
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,160
It's very weird.

2472
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:58,160
I, it's not only that one Jonathan comment that said test.

2473
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,160
Fuck.

2474
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:03,160
I saw other people who said like shit and stuff in their comments.

2475
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:05,160
I don't see Jonathan.

2476
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:07,160
I don't see.

2477
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:11,160
I forget what it was called, but he said, he said it was Jonathan, but I don't, I mean,

2478
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,160
I'm sure it was there.

2479
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:14,160
I just don't see it at the moment.

2480
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:16,160
Maybe it was taken down.

2481
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:17,160
Yeah.

2482
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,160
I don't see.

2483
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:22,160
I, I don't see a comment from Jonathan.

2484
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:29,160
Also, uh, new commented, um, that the Imgur links keep breaking.

2485
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:35,160
And then Tony replies, you got to add dot JPEG to the URL manually.

2486
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:45,160
Uh, I think, I guess like when it's, when it's in link form, the, okay.

2487
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:49,160
This is so, yeah, the link has JPEG in it.

2488
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:54,160
But when you click it, it brings you to a version of the link that does not have the dot JPEG.

2489
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:59,160
So you have to manually add the dot JPEG to see the image.

2490
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:04,160
And, and I just don't, and I just don't understand.

2491
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:05,160
Weird.

2492
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:09,160
I just don't like, what the fuck?

2493
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:11,160
Um, yeah.

2494
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:18,160
And, and also like why, also like why does it not know where the image, like, like the,

2495
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:20,160
like the file extension is the same.

2496
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:25,160
Like the Imgur.com slash and then the numbered letter hash is the same.

2497
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:28,160
So why, why doesn't that work?

2498
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,160
What the hell?

2499
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,160
Man, I don't get it.

2500
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:35,160
I don't, I don't get it at all.

2501
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,160
Okay, well, I don't know.

2502
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,160
Anyway, yeah.

2503
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,160
Uh, the swearing thing?

2504
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:46,160
Man, I don't know.

2505
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:47,160
It's mysterious to me too.

2506
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:51,160
Let me, commenters, I mean, if you got any theories about what's...

2507
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:54,160
Yeah, I don't, I don't see Jonathan either.

2508
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:58,160
I think he might have also been removed, perhaps?

2509
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:01,160
And I'm logged into the PCP account.

2510
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:05,160
So if anyone would be able to see it, it would be me.

2511
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:13,160
It's hard to know what's happening because like, it seems like comments can and do exist with swears in them.

2512
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:14,160
Yeah.

2513
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:18,160
I need to like be thinking about it to see, to notice if there are none.

2514
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:22,160
But I know I saw that one that he's referring to.

2515
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:23,160
Okay.

2516
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:28,160
Let me slip.

2517
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,160
No, there, there are none.

2518
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:34,160
None of them are in the, like, comments held for review.

2519
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:40,160
I'm looking at the YouTube studio right now.

2520
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:49,160
Someone, one got flagged for spam that said like, like this comment if you, if you passed NoNate, NoNate November.

2521
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
That sucks.

2522
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:54,160
Hmm.

2523
02:16:54,160 --> 02:17:01,160
And then...

2524
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:02,160
What the hell?

2525
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:03,160
Okay.

2526
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:04,160
I'm sorry.

2527
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:05,160
There's just another comment here.

2528
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,160
And this is a very strange exchange.

2529
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,160
This was a month ago.

2530
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:10,160
This one got flagged as potentially inappropriate.

2531
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:13,160
And, okay, commenter Radodon.

2532
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:15,160
This was not a hidden comment.

2533
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,160
He commented, I really don't, this was on the, the, the Tisnaker episode.

2534
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:22,160
I really don't like that the dead YouTuber list sourced by subscriber count.

2535
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:25,160
It feels like it's placing the value of their life on big number.

2536
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:30,160
And then playmaker responds at Radodon.

2537
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:31,160
This isn't up for debate.

2538
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,160
You were wrong and I'm correct in.

2539
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:36,160
You delete you comment now and apologize.

2540
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:40,160
You're a butt, you're just a butthurt loser who works some lower management job and is mad.

2541
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:43,160
I called you out for your life being less value than mine.

2542
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,160
I think it's a joke.

2543
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,160
But I don't get it.

2544
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,160
I don't get it.

2545
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:57,160
That was like, were they, were they like referencing the subscriber number that the user has compared to their own?

2546
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:02,160
I don't, I think it's a joke about like, you know, ranking people of a value.

2547
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,160
Your life is worth less than mine.

2548
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,160
But like, you're wrong.

2549
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,160
I'm correcting.

2550
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,160
Delete your comment.

2551
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:09,160
You lower management job.

2552
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:10,160
What?

2553
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:17,160
Maybe there was some other, maybe there were other context or maybe there were other comments in the thread that I made.

2554
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:18,160
That I missed.

2555
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,160
I don't know.

2556
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:22,160
This just seems, this is a little bit confused.

2557
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:27,160
Anyway, anyway, obviously that comment gets approved and is going back up.

2558
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:33,160
We don't, we wouldn't want people to miss out on that in the future.

2559
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:34,160
Okay.

2560
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:36,160
Next, next voicemail.

2561
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,160
This is the looks like it might be the final one.

2562
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:46,160
If you can believe it is YouTube swearing arc three final three, two, one, go.

2563
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:47,160
Okay.

2564
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,160
I'm back from peeing now.

2565
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:54,160
So I looked at the comments, like I counted all the comments and I saw that there are,

2566
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,160
it says there are more comments than actually showed up.

2567
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:58,160
Yeah.

2568
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:00,160
Five or six missing comments or something.

2569
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:07,160
Sometimes if you, if you sort by new or them appear fucking their comments are deleted by doing epic freaking swear.

2570
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:08,160
So it's not just me.

2571
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,160
I'm not crazy.

2572
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:14,160
I just don't believe that there should be this crazy fucking swearing disparity where the

2573
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:21,160
comments gets the freaking swear in the comments, but those fucking lower class peons don't even get to say the word fucking sucks.

2574
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:27,160
It's, it's the displayed number of comments sometimes just seems totally random.

2575
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:34,160
Like, okay, sometimes there will be comments that you can't see, but they're not hidden because if you sort by new, they appear and you can see them.

2576
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:36,160
And I don't know why that happens.

2577
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:48,160
I think like the comments, they try to do like most good comments, like, oh, the ones that you probably want to read the algorithm said so.

2578
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:52,160
So they get like the comments with loads of likes, loads of replies, stuff like that.

2579
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,160
But some of them are just not there.

2580
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:57,160
And then comments that have no engagement just don't appear in that format.

2581
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,160
So you need to click new to find them all.

2582
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:00,160
Sometimes.

2583
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:05,160
So yeah, a lot of times I see, yeah, like it will display a higher number than I see.

2584
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,160
And then I sort by new and then I go, ah, there they are.

2585
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:12,160
Other times I've seen the number be less than the number of comments.

2586
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:27,160
Like this was on a, someone was, someone pointed out on a, on a branches of Yig video, a bunch of people posted like comments about the blue rays, the plebeian blue rays, and they were being deleted.

2587
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,160
All those comments were being deleted.

2588
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:39,160
But the weird thing was that like, there were like three, there were like four, there eventually came to be like four visible comments on that video.

2589
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:42,160
But the number of comments it said it had was two.

2590
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:46,160
It was like two comments and then there were like four comments down below.

2591
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:51,160
And in fact, I know there were more because there were more of what had been there that had been hidden.

2592
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:54,160
So I don't know why that was happening.

2593
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:58,160
The point is that the YouTube comment thing is bizarre.

2594
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:00,160
YouTube is crazy.

2595
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:05,160
Can I, I'm going to complain about something also this is not YouTube related but on Reddit.

2596
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:20,160
Okay, I might be crazy, but when I am looking for something on Reddit, I can be on a subreddit and I can go to the search bar and I can search for a word that I know is in the subreddit.

2597
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:26,160
I can search for a word that I can literally see posts in the subreddit that have the word in it.

2598
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:29,160
And I will search in the subreddit for that word that is there.

2599
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:32,160
I can see it and it returns no results.

2600
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:35,160
The like the Reddit search function like simply doesn't work.

2601
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:38,160
And I am and I can't understand it.

2602
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:43,160
I'm like am I I don't know if anyone else has knows what I'm talking about.

2603
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:46,160
Like am I crazy is my computer broke.

2604
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,160
I don't think so.

2605
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:52,160
I think Reddit just like why have a search bar?

2606
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,160
Take away the search if you take the search bar away.

2607
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,160
Oh, yeah.

2608
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:57,160
If it simply doesn't work.

2609
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:03,160
Searching with the search bar on Reddit almost always returns nothing.

2610
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:04,160
So why?

2611
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,160
Why?

2612
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,160
I don't know.

2613
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:07,160
Why?

2614
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,160
Why would that happen?

2615
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:11,160
Like symbols maybe to put it in like brackets or.

2616
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:12,160
I hate that.

2617
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:13,160
Marks.

2618
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,160
It really pisses me off.

2619
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:16,160
Really pisses me off.

2620
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,160
How hard is it to make your website work, bros?

2621
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,160
It's your job.

2622
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:21,160
Well, they don't need to do that.

2623
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:23,160
They go all the traffic anyway.

2624
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:25,160
I guess.

2625
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:29,160
Well, they don't have my traffic because their fucking website doesn't work.

2626
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:33,160
Yeah, that was the last voicemail.

2627
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,160
Wait, what did he say?

2628
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,160
What was that last what did he even say about that?

2629
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:40,160
I don't even remember what the content of the last one was.

2630
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:50,160
It was just sort of continuation of people being like not swear allowed and they're

2631
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,160
censored and it sucks.

2632
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,160
Okay.

2633
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:54,160
Good.

2634
02:22:54,160 --> 02:23:02,160
Well, I also noticed their name is wet piss January at dusty dumps.com.

2635
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,160
Yep.

2636
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:04,160
Oh, I know.

2637
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:05,160
Oh, I saw.

2638
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,160
Is it wet piss January?

2639
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,160
It's quite, it's nearly over.

2640
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:14,160
I think every January is wet piss January.

2641
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:17,160
I'm going to go ahead and say it.

2642
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:23,160
Is it possible to do a dusty piss?

2643
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,160
I think you have to be a professional.

2644
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:28,160
I think that's for professionals only.

2645
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:29,160
Dang.

2646
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:35,160
You have to be like Christian Bale getting skinny enough to play the machinist.

2647
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:39,160
You know, you have to be a you have to be an expert at that sort of thing to get like

2648
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:42,160
that without risking your health.

2649
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:43,160
Lamal.

2650
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,160
Yeah.

2651
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,160
Okay.

2652
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:46,160
That's it.

2653
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:49,160
A pathetic two hour episode this week.

2654
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,160
But I think.

2655
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,160
Yeah.

2656
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,160
Sorry.

2657
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,160
We're sorry.

2658
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,160
Sorry.

2659
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,160
Go men this side.

2660
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,160
Oh, forgive me.

2661
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,160
There's just, I just not a lot to talk about right now for me.

2662
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,160
No, not really.

2663
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,160
Just doing.

2664
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:06,160
I hope to have more to talk about soon because I am.

2665
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:13,160
Well, no, I can't put anything out because I got to like finish the pages.

2666
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:17,160
So, so no, the content right will continue.

2667
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:25,160
Nothing interesting will ever happen.

2668
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:26,160
Bye.

2669
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:29,160
The end.
