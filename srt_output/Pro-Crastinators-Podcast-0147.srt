00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, where we clip the mic every single time.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm Ben Saint, and who else is fuckin' here?

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,520
We got Nate Bestman, the best guy ever.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Konnichiwa minasamah onigashima.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh, hi ogozaimasu.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,160
We got Lethal Aurora Mage here.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Oh, hi y'all.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,240
Oh, Shinkansen desuwa, we got Hippocrit.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,240
Guten Morgen.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,960
Holy shit, fuckin' Nuremberg trial time, and we got Digibro.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,280
Hungover, pissed off, ready to kill.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh, hi ogozaimasu.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
What's goin' on?

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,360
You pissed off about the Crunchyroll Awards from yesterday, Digi?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
I saw you streamin' those.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm pissed off about living in a shit toilet earth.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
That's what I'm pissed off about.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,960
I'm pissed off about everybody being wrong about everything.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm mad that, you know what?

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm just sick and tired of pretending like it's okay for people to have different opinions from me.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,360
But Digi, you just said there can't be a critical authority.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,040
What the fuck, dude?

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,560
What do you have to say to that?

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Well, obviously the man was wrong.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,440
Obviously, you know what?

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,240
It's not about having authority.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,680
It's about taking matters into my own hands, you know what I'm sayin'?

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,040
Public genocide and all that.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
The beta uprising and whatnot.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Yeah.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:58,840
You know, I thought, I was thinkin' about this after your loud video about how JoJo Part 5 has shit character designs or whatever, how the guys don't blend into the background.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,440
And I was like, okay, fair.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,240
But I think I know why everybody voted for it.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,800
I mean, I don't know how they, I assume it works on Oscar's logic.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I think what they do, this is a complete guess, but everybody just saw like how, quote, fabulous all the JoJo posing is.

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,000
And how fabulous all the like thick outline characters look.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
And that's all they needed.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll tell you, it's because the anime awards are a popularity contest.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,480
Because it literally is fan-voted.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,560
So it's just whatever's the most popular show in the world.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Oh, fan-voted should not even win every time.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
That's a shit show in the making.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,320
No, my rage had nothing to do with the actual award.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,920
It was that what I livestreamed my reactions to the Crunchyroll Awards.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,320
And I was shitting on the art in JoJo Part 5.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,320
And my chat was like, was all pissed off at me.

47
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,480
So then I made a separate video screaming about it additionally.

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,560
And then, and I had also tweeted.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:07,320
And it's one of those cases where, you know, when you're tweet, when you, when you make a spicy controversial tweet and it escapes from your audience and enters the open internet, that's what happened.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,640
So it was just hundreds and hundreds of JoJo stands crawling out of the woodwork to call me a boomer for some reason.

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,760
There's a lot of those.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Is that what you call like a fan?

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Is that what you call like a rabid fan of JoJo, a stand?

54
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Well, hey, all right.

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,960
That's pretty funny.

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
They have those for other things, right?

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,000
Like a stand.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh, yeah.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,680
Yeah.

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,360
So it's like, it's a stand.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,880
But for JoJo, it's a stand.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,440
Duh.

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,320
Okay.

65
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,960
I think I know the lore behind the word stand.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,880
It's because of the.

67
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,280
It's the Eminem song.

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,520
Yeah.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,080
The Eminem.

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah.

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Yeah.

72
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
Who's that?

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
I love Eminem.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,480
There's dude, listen.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,760
Listen, I'm white, so I cannot appreciate hip hop ever.

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,600
It's literally impossible.

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,680
Even when it's by a white guy.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,200
Especially when it's by a white guy, because he's a fucking uncle Tom.

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,520
All right.

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,680
But when I was.

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,320
What was that mean?

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,280
But in like, what does he mean?

84
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,120
Yeah.

85
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,160
I really like that song.

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,600
I didn't listen to Eminem or anything, but that song would come on the radio.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
And I was like, oh, it's got that sample.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,320
It's got that sample from that white guy.

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,960
It's got that non-hip hop sample that provides a bridge for understanding for me.

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,600
That song made me really sad.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,080
I liked it.

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, yeah, it's a good song.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,840
You know, I was happy to see PCP member number 10, Jeff Thu, at the Crunchyroll Awards.

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh, boy.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,160
Representing our organization well.

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
It's nice to see how.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,080
I mean, of course, Jeff would be there.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,400
Of course.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,160
I can't believe they let him give the the anime of the year award.

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,640
That was crazy.

101
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,120
That is that.

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
That's the top billing.

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,080
That is the top billing and they gave it to Jeff.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,320
So clearly they're investing in his future, at least to a little bit.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,600
The most Japan of all.

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
He loves Japan.

107
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Period.

108
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,520
He's a guy that, you know, this was this.

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
This was fascinating to me.

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Have you guys been watching Matt Pat's recent videos about like how

111
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,800
a company stole money from him and stuff?

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,320
Where he makes like extremely furiously, like his face stretches really angrily.

113
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,960
He's very funny.

114
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,160
I've been screenshotting his face.

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,520
Give us taken screenshots of his face during those videos.

116
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,840
Just posted them in the chat there.

117
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,720
He's just so mad.

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,840
We should put some in the show notes.

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,080
We should go back and find some if we can.

120
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,120
He's very mad.

121
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,400
He's extremely frustrated.

122
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,640
OK, so Matt Pat recently, on his big video, Game Theory or whatever,

124
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,080
he made two videos now that are him basically calling out what he perceives at the very least

125
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,800
to be like underhanded and or shady business tactics by like large MCNs like the one that

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
he is signed to in particular.

127
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
Oh wait, wait, Matt Pat's having a problem with that?

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,320
Because I'm pretty sure he's signed to Studio 71.

129
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,080
Right?

130
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,920
OK, that is not the name.

131
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,560
Is that the one you were signed to, did you?

132
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, because when I signed up for it, then they had like on the top of their website is

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,720
like Matt Pat, our main guy, and that was part of why I was why I signed up with them

134
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,440
because I just assumed that Matt Pat, the guy who everybody considers the YouTube guru,

135
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,280
would have picked the best MCN.

136
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
Oh yeah, I mean that's fair.

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,520
And it turns out that they fucked him over and he's really pissed.

138
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,760
Well, OK, I'm not so big a Studio 71.

139
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,240
I just don't think that's the that's definitely not the name he used and I can't fucking remember

140
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,800
what it is.

141
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
It could be a subsidiary company or whatever, you know.

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,320
That's definitely true.

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,080
But like what's, I'm sympathetic to his concerns and whatnot.

144
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,440
He feels ripped off specifically in that like, so he's signed up to an agreement where like

145
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,400
the money that he earns through AdSense on his channel gets delivered to this company first

146
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,720
then later gets paid out as is I think the standard procedure.

147
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,200
It's hard for me to have sympathy for Matt Pat, but it's even harder for me to have sympathy

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,160
for an MCN.

149
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
So I'm really torn here.

150
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
MCNs are evil.

151
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
They are all bad.

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,040
I have never heard a story of one being not bad and they don't do anything.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,160
They litter because there's nothing they can do protections.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,960
The only thing as far as they don't do that value.

155
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,120
No, they never did that because all they did the reason that people seem to think that

156
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,600
their MCNs were helping them with that the MCN just does the same thing that you yourself

157
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
are capable of doing.

158
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,320
Most people just don't know that.

159
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Yeah, like the same steps that you consider that a valuable service.

160
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,600
Wait, what is this thing that you can do that they do for you?

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,840
I mean, they literally just like file counter notifications or like email the company and

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,640
try to get it fixed, but they have no more sway in doing that than you do as an individual.

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Well, I mean, they might as a corporate entity, they might have more clout.

164
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,240
They do not.

165
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Believe me, I know.

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,320
It's easier to just get your fans to email a company because then they get a lot of emails

167
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
and that will make them more likely to.

168
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,400
I mean, in these videos, that's like basically the only thing MatPat said is any value.

169
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,320
But as you said, it might just be again, nothing beyond what you can already do yourself.

170
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,160
But the reason I brought him up to begin with was just that like MatPat and Jeff,

171
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,480
okay, Jeff came from a marketing background or like a gaming journalism background before he

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
started his anime work.

173
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,320
And so he's got marketing on the mind from the very start of his channel,

174
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
which has helped him a lot and I'm not even bashing for it.

175
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,920
But the fascinating thing to me was to learn that MatPat here, I learned in his first video,

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,800
he just comes around and said this, maybe this was public knowledge, but I didn't know.

177
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,040
He straight up worked for an MCN before he started his channel game theory and like

178
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,640
worked on them in parallel.

179
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,800
And he just had the complete insider scoop as to how all this shit worked.

180
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,120
And I was like, well, no fucking wonder he's the guru of at least the YouTuber side guru

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,240
of like MCM and like knowledge about how to spread your company and optimal release schedules and

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,640
whatnot.

183
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,080
I guess nobody, I don't know, again, not to, I'm not shitting on either of them.

184
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,360
And it's not that they're worse or more inauthentic, but when you like lead with marketing,

185
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,560
I guess it just, it ebbs away at your like, you know, real gamerness and makes you feel

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,400
more corporatized, I guess.

187
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,640
Sure.

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,560
That's, that's all.

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,240
But I mean, I don't know, like it's, it's an interesting series of videos.

190
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,080
And it's like, I'm, MatPat is a very business savvy guy.

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,320
And it's surprising to me that he's getting as much traction as he is, considering like,

192
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,200
like his case for these things is like, he admits that like he signed an agreement with

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,760
these companies, Defy, defy is the name of the company, that like they would keep the money,

194
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,040
they'd pay him out later.

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,840
And he himself went out of his way to put himself in an even more like negative position

196
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,120
because of a specific request where they could like hold on to more of his money.

197
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
But like, but that's a side.

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,520
The 1.7 million is from like everybody signed with defy.

199
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,960
But like, after signing an agreement to put himself in this position, he is now after

200
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,000
the fact complaining that like business ventures have gone badly in this way.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,960
And that like, while, while defy, excuse me, while defy, like made an investment or like

202
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,000
some bank made an investment in defy, that defy investment has gone away because defy

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,160
has folded up shop and gone under.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,440
The bank is ally.

205
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,840
Thank you.

206
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,200
That's right.

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,360
Ally bank, like they invest in defy.

208
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,920
And so because the investment did not work out defy like overextended itself and failed

209
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,120
or whatever, it's understandable that ally bank not get their investment back.

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,040
But it's, but MatPat's claim is that it is not fair and not understandable that these

211
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,720
YouTubers signed to this MCM do not get their pay.

212
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,280
But I would argue that this is all tied up in like the legal agreements they made.

213
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,120
And so it's kind of hard for me to sympathize, especially with MatPat himself.

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
The leader of the bunch.

215
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,360
And you know him well.

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,680
The MCM contracts are extremely vague and they leave a lot of like, if you read it,

217
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,160
you should be able to recognize that and like know that you're going to get fucked.

218
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,560
Like this just takes me back to like when, when Ben faith sealed his fate by agreeing to work on,

219
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
you know, what?

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,880
Don't say it.

221
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,280
T.F.

222
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Don't say it.

223
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,800
Don't say analysis.

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,440
Anarchy.

225
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,320
When he agreed to do that and I didn't, I was like, well, this is me making a better

226
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,520
decision. I know I'm right.

227
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,640
I have no sympathy.

228
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,080
And it's the same for everybody who's ever signed to an MCM.

229
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm sitting over here being like, I've gotten offers.

230
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
I knew this was retarded.

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,560
So I didn't do it.

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,440
You made the mistake.

233
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,280
Listen, why am I supposed to feel bad for you?

234
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,320
Look, you, you don't look.

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,960
All right.

236
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Yes.

237
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,120
I waited until midnight and I, and I, and I said Dr. Wolfe into my mirror three times

238
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,600
and he appeared and he reached out with the contract and I signed it in blood.

239
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,240
And I, you know, it was just, I was peer pressured is what I'm saying.

240
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,720
I was peer.

241
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,280
Okay.

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,080
Okay.

243
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,200
But me, I had social fortitude and I did not give in.

244
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,640
I guess is like, surely you expect like if you sign up to anything, you expect that

245
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,800
they will fuck you over if they can.

246
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,160
Like nobody's a good guy.

247
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,480
Whenever you want to like, like with studio 71, the way that they pitched themselves,

248
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,640
it's, it's crazy because they basically pitched themselves as like, oh, we are too good for you.

249
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,440
Cause like when I, the contract I signed was like, uh, we'll have you for one year minimum.

250
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,840
And then after that, basically depending on if we think that it's working out,

251
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,280
like if you're growing at a good enough rate, we keep you on.

252
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,200
But if you're, if we think you're not growing or like you're not really participating,

253
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,880
then we're going to cut you.

254
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,240
So that makes it out like, oh yeah, this is like a really, like they're really serious about you.

255
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,320
You know, they really want to, but then I signed up and they never

256
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,880
did a single thing for me the whole time.

257
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,600
And like after a year had passed, they were still taking my money because, you know,

258
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,800
basically their contract is just, we can just have you for us.

259
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,440
Like, yeah, a year is required, but then after that, uh, you know, it's up to us,

260
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
whether we cut you loose or not.

261
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,120
So they're just taking my money and doing nothing.

262
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,000
And so I had to like send them a number of very harshly worded emails

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,400
before I was able to end that relationship.

264
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
And I had to be like straight up cut me off because you are taking my fucking money.

265
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah, it took a while.

266
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,960
It took a lot of, because they kept being like, well, but we could, you know,

267
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,640
well, we could work something out.

268
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,240
Like, you know, let's talk about it.

269
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,320
And I'm like, it's already, you've taken so much of my money already.

270
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,720
Like you've already gone way past the point of reaching my trust completely.

271
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,960
There is no way I would work with you anymore.

272
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,280
You know,

273
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,280
So, you know, like to be fair, I understand that matpat is just like the leading voice here.

274
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,000
And he's using his platform for something that I suppose is fair.

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,360
If this was me and I had made the mistake of signing with an MCM,

276
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,560
I would want somebody like matpat to like be trying to get me my fair share of the money or whatever.

277
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,080
I don't know.

278
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,200
I guess like, please listen to the show and look at these fucking matpat faces.

279
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,680
They are just click through all the links down there, everybody.

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,240
Oh, he's, he's a, he's a treasure.

281
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Where did you post them?

282
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,880
They're in the audio links there.

283
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,360
Click on the audio links, uh, chat down there.

284
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
And uh, you'll see.

285
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,960
Does he look a little like purple?

286
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
He's a little purple.

287
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,000
He died.

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,240
Okay.

289
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,960
He does not acknowledge in the video, but between these two,

290
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,360
he put a little purple schmutz in his hair.

291
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,840
Why?

292
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,400
It looks weird as fuck now that I've noticed it.

293
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,880
I don't know.

294
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,160
But as a guy who loves purple, I'm a little bit pissed that he's co-opting my color.

295
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,600
I, I, I was thinking, I was literally thinking of doing that exactly.

296
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Can you ping me in the chat?

297
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Because I'm the cop killer and I should have purple hair.

298
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
Well, I mean, now you'll be matpat too, so.

299
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,840
No, he fucked.

300
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,480
I guess.

301
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Lame.

302
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,880
No, but you gotta, you gotta do black and white.

303
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
You gotta have a zebra hair.

304
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Oh, that'd be cool.

305
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
You know, I mean, I'm already fucking gray.

306
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm already graying at a, at an alarming pace.

307
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,480
So, uh, I guess I better just lean into it.

308
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
Graying could be a good look though.

309
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Yeah, I don't know.

310
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,040
Yeah, I don't know.

311
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,760
They're worst things.

312
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,320
Oh.

313
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,640
Like being autistic, which I also am.

314
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,600
But I mean, the reason I brought that up was originally just because like,

315
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,760
Jeff reminded me, Jeff is matpat.

316
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
Uh, they're just the same guy and that's fine.

317
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,080
And that's fine.

318
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,240
Um, yeah, I don't know.

319
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,800
I don't, uh, Matpat doesn't have the same flaccidity.

320
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,600
He's more of a.

321
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Flaccidity.

322
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,600
He's more of an animated character.

323
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Okay, we were watching, I'm shout out to May for calling Jeff through the most

324
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,880
flaccid man alive during the live stream yesterday.

325
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,400
But what is worth, Victor's the one who came up with that one.

326
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh, did he really?

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay.

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
Jeff, I love you, but that is hilarious.

329
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,760
Victor called him Jeff Flaccid.

330
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,080
He looked.

331
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,320
Okay.

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,960
I can't tell the difference between Jeff and Arkada, by the way.

333
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,080
If you see them next to each other.

334
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,880
I don't know who Arkada is.

335
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
He's, he's matpat.

336
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,760
Go, go into the Crunchyroll Awards and at the very end, you can go to my video

337
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,400
upload of it.

338
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm not watching the Crunchyroll.

339
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,440
No, just, just skip to the very end where everybody's on screen and like,

340
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,880
Arkada standing right behind Jeff and they look exactly the same.

341
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,360
Like they have the same haircut, same glasses, same face.

342
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,040
Who wears like the red like suit?

343
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,280
Yeah.

344
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes.

345
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,480
That's him.

346
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,120
Oh, yeah.

347
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,280
He's like, he's like Jeff with a blonde ponytail.

348
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,560
I'm a little bit pissed.

349
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,000
You're in the same like doll maker, like character building program and you just

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,800
swap the hair.

351
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Well, that's the thing.

352
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
He's not, no, he's not blonde anymore.

353
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,760
He now has the same hair as Jeff.

354
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,280
Like at the Crunchyroll Awards, they had the same color, hairstyle, everything.

355
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,360
Like they look exactly the same.

356
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,920
I suppose I respected that he, he dressed up in cosplayed as the manager.

357
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,920
From, from, as Jeff, one cosplay was Jeff Thu.

358
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,640
The other cosplay was manager from Zombie Lens Saga.

359
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,440
And I was like, damn it.

360
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,280
I just don't know what my, my looks are.

361
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Oh, I love the better for Zombie Lens Saga.

362
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch that show one of these days.

363
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:41,960
Anyway.

364
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,280
Watch it.

365
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,160
Oh my God.

366
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,600
You haven't watched the shame.

367
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:44,680
I will.

368
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
It looks really good.

369
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,160
I watched Digi's review and it was very informative,

370
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,320
but it looks worth my time at the very least.

371
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,440
Are we, uh, all right.

372
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
Are we off that topic?

373
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,280
Because I had something.

374
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,440
We're off, we're off it.

375
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,920
All right.

376
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
Well, speaking of, speaking of hair,

377
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,720
I want to tell you a story and I almost don't want to tell this,

378
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,600
but I think, I think by the time that this comes out,

379
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,680
I will have made peace with it.

380
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,000
I hope.

381
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,320
Okay.

382
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,400
You know, this will force me to make peace though.

383
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,920
I'll no longer have any choice.

384
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,160
All right.

385
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,080
So a couple of weeks ago, I was like,

386
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
all right, I need a fucking haircut.

387
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,720
So I fucking, I don't, I had cut my own hair.

388
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,760
I've been doing this for years.

389
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,960
So I took some buzzers and I went into the bathroom and I looked in the mirror

390
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
and I just like, I don't know.

391
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,400
I like, I liked the hair long in the back.

392
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,800
I liked it long on top and in front,

393
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,000
but the way it was like puffing out on the sides, it was bad.

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,560
So I just took it and I trimmed one side and I cut like one side short,

395
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,680
like quite short and I looked at it and I was like, I like it.

396
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,760
I took some pictures.

397
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,800
I put them in my discord.

398
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,360
People were like, hey, this is look, this is a good look for you.

399
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,560
I was like, okay, cool.

400
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,360
I was like, yeah.

401
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,440
So I got a little like short on the side cut.

402
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,920
It's nice.

403
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,320
It's neat.

404
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,480
So I go back and I look at it.

405
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,920
I take some like pictures from the side and I look at it and I examine it and I'm like,

406
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,200
sloppy, sloppy.

407
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,440
So I want to neaten it up.

408
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,320
So I go in.

409
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Yeah.

410
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,400
So I go in with the, with the buzzers, right?

411
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,600
And I put it a little shorter and I just, and I start buzzing and I'm like,

412
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,240
oh, I can't see.

413
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,440
So I, I rig up a makeshift, a sort of, uh, oh God, what's a Rube Goldberg machine?

414
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,680
Yeah.

415
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,240
I use a USB cable to tie to the back of a mirror and I hang the mirror over the

416
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,160
shower door and I tie the other end to the, the shower handle so that it is hanging.

417
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,000
And then I stuff a lot of tissue paper behind it to tilt it at just such an angle so that

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,560
I can see the wall mirror and this hanging mirror reflect the side of my head so I can

419
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
get a good view.

420
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,120
And so I go in with the buzzers and I cut it short and I'm like, oh,

421
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,560
shit, that's a little too short.

422
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
That's a little too short.

423
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,280
And then I'm like, oh, shit.

424
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,520
Okay.

425
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,240
What do I do?

426
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,200
Got to clean this up.

427
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,320
And I'm like, wait a minute.

428
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,040
I got, I want to get, I want to get like a, I want this to be neat.

429
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,840
I want this to be neat.

430
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,960
I want this to look deliberate.

431
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,480
I don't want this to look like an accident.

432
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,400
Long story short, I grabbed my fucking razor and I shaved the entire side of my head bald.

433
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,320
So I just have a, so I just have a straight up Skrillex cut right now.

434
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,280
That's what I'm rocking.

435
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
And I'm going to be frank.

436
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
I don't like it.

437
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,800
I don't like it, but I think that I will like it.

438
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,840
I think that once it grows out, maybe like a quarter inch.

439
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,440
So it's not like bald.

440
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,720
I think once it grows out a little bit, I will be fine with it and like it again.

441
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,200
But right now.

442
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,160
I can't even picture you with this haircut you're describing.

443
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,120
I have it.

444
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,920
We all need to see.

445
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
Post image.

446
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,000
I think, oh God, it's really bad.

447
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,760
Look, you can get one later if you don't have it now.

448
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,440
I have one on my phone.

449
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,560
I will post one in a second.

450
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,040
Okay.

451
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:39,800
But the, the, the, the, the, so I have been, I have not left my room in several days without

452
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
putting a hat on.

453
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm just waiting.

454
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,560
You're really proud of this haircut.

455
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,040
You can tell.

456
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,160
I'm wait, no, I told you, I don't like it.

457
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't like, I don't like the way that it looks being like

458
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
completely bare on one side.

459
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,720
It's bizarre.

460
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,160
I look like a white nationalist.

461
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,520
I look like I'm going to go and, and curb stomps to minorities.

462
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
It triggers me just thinking about it.

463
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,680
Just looking at myself in the mirror.

464
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,240
I have a panic attack.

465
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,000
I watched the American history X the other day.

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,560
Excellent film.

467
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,520
Everyone should check it out.

468
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,640
Anyway, that's what I have to say.

469
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm literally shaking.

470
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Ben, was it worth saving the $14 or the $10 on a decent haircut

471
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
to, to do all this, to put yourself through this?

472
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,760
It was because if I had spent that $14, not only would I be out the $14,

473
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,840
I would have missed out on an experience, an adventure,

474
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,560
a negative experience, but an experience nonetheless.

475
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,040
That's true.

476
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,160
Hold on.

477
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
And now you'll grow as a person because of it.

478
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,200
Maybe.

479
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,600
I don't know.

480
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
No, Ben won't learn.

481
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Ben won't change.

482
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm not sure.

483
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,280
He won't evolve.

484
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm going to try and post one of the pictures I took in the discord.

485
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
It looks bad.

486
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,080
Get ready to laugh.

487
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
Get ready to fucking laugh at me,

488
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,000
everyone.

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm looking.

490
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,840
It's going to be, hold on.

491
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,320
Sorry.

492
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,280
It's, I'm gay.

493
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,120
Oh no.

494
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

495
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,720
Cut this out.

496
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,600
Cut this all out.

497
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, it looks so fucking shit, dudes.

498
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,280
It looks so fucking shit.

499
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, I'm very excited to see that.

500
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,920
See, not only was this picture like it's bad and from a bad angle,

501
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,960
but also my hair was greasy because I hadn't showered at the time.

502
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
Well, there's your problem right there.

503
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,440
So I just look like, so I just look like fucking trash.

504
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
Well, good.

505
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,880
Here we go.

506
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,280
There it is.

507
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,000
There it is.

508
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
God, why have you done this?

509
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,800
No, it's fine.

510
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,480
It's, yeah.

511
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,000
I mean, you just look like, you just look like you go to art school.

512
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:25,960
Yeah.

513
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
That's, that's basically true.

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,560
It's good.

515
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,320
Well, the worst thing about this is that it's greasy.

516
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,800
When it grows out, when it's like a quarter inch long

517
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,360
and it looks like I have hair there, I will be fine with it.

518
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Yeah.

519
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,160
It's actually less bad than I thought it was going to be.

520
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,720
Yeah.

521
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,040
Okay.

522
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,000
Well, thank you.

523
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,320
Yeah.

524
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,640
I don't know.

525
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,400
I'd like, I'd like cut the longness shorter elsewhere, I guess, but I don't know.

526
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,280
In the back.

527
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,480
Just like everywhere, I guess.

528
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,240
Especially the back, I suppose.

529
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,040
I like it long.

530
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,000
I like it long, though.

531
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,120
No, fair enough.

532
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,520
So that's my, that's my hair story.

533
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,560
This is why men invented money, Ben, so that you can have other people exchange

534
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,840
goods and services, in this case services, so that you cannot, you know.

535
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,560
Well, you know what, Nate?

536
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
Here's the thing.

537
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,160
Yeah.

538
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,560
I could go to a barber and get a professional cut, but you know what?

539
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,480
That would be an assembly line cut.

540
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,880
This is, this is an indie, this is an indie cut.

541
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,080
This is, this is a work of art, not necessarily a good one,

542
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,360
but this is a work of art.

543
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,480
This is unique.

544
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,520
This is a post-modern work of art, so yeah.

545
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,880
You know, sometimes I wonder what would happen if I was just, you know,

546
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
should I just shave all my hair off?

547
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,000
I did shave all my hair off in college one time.

548
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,960
And, well, the other, a while back, I had Munchie and Kazi and Crack and my friend,

549
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,320
John, we were all hanging out and I showed them fake pictures from my Facebook of me

550
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,680
when I had a shaved head and everyone agreed this is a bad look for you.

551
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,480
Don't do this again.

552
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,000
I was like, you're right.

553
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,200
I don't, I don't have a head shave.

555
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
You look like the lumberjack look.

556
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,400
That's, that's still the, like, literally, T-Bap Q&A, his peak bend look.

557
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,280
As it was peak Nate look.

558
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,840
Yeah.

559
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,800
And I'm, you know, I'm getting back to it because I'm growing the beard back.

560
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,200
And I'm looking.

561
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,520
Well, good.

562
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,840
That's good.

563
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,280
Also, I'm getting thinner.

564
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm like, down to 100.

565
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,120
The beard's going a long way.

566
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,320
The beard's going a long way.

567
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,280
Both add a lot to this.

568
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm down to 160 pounds.

569
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,240
That's great.

570
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,640
I like, I like.

571
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,000
Fuck, Ben weighs less than I do.

572
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
What's going on?

573
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,520
I like.

574
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,320
He's working it.

575
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,600
I like where things are going.

576
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,320
I like where things are going for, for old Ben Saint.

577
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
I agree.

578
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,000
I agree.

579
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Yeah.

580
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
Good work.

581
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Just need to up your gamer score and then you'll be just winning all aspects of life.

582
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,920
Well, one, the one area that I'm lacking in is that I have a shitty old phone that

583
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,720
grinds to a halt when I PVP in Pokemon Go.

584
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,880
So once I fix that, I will be perfect.

585
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,200
I will be, I will have achieved perfect cell stats.

586
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,680
What do you have?

587
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,560
What do you have right now?

588
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,920
Samsung Galaxy S5.

589
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
It's like six or seven years old.

590
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,680
Yeah.

591
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,320
Time to upgrade.

592
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,200
Time to upgrade that shit.

593
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,480
Well, that's the tale of Ben's hair and everyone mock him.

594
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
Please make meme edits of this.

595
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,720
Like, like put like Nazi tattoos on the skull.

596
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
Don't put, don't put this picture on the show notes.

597
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
Just like, don't put it.

598
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,200
We have to put it in the show notes.

599
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,680
You kidding me?

600
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,640
No, but it's Ben.

601
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,520
Yeah, we've been discussing it consistently for minutes.

602
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,320
Ben, they have to see it.

603
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,200
They have to.

604
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,760
It's too late.

605
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,320
You've revoked your rights.

606
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,280
I wish I'd taken a, I wish I'd taken a less greasy one.

607
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,520
If you want to take another less greasy one, we can replace this.

608
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,480
But if that doesn't show up, this is the one that's going out.

609
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,640
Okay.

610
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,520
So it's on you.

611
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,080
It's on you.

612
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,080
I will try and flatter this admittedly unflattering look.

613
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,240
As best I can.

614
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,880
Okay, good.

615
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,600
I want to see those beauty shots in the chat.

616
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

617
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,200
All right.

618
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,360
Listen, I went, I was out for community with, with Kazi yesterday.

619
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,320
I kept the hat on the whole time, just didn't, didn't acknowledge it.

620
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,040
Yeah.

621
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,480
Did she say anything?

622
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,560
Did she laid any mean remarks?

623
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,040
Well, there was a moment, there was a moment where I got scared and I started sweating.

624
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,520
When she was like, I heard you gave yourself a haircut.

625
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,160
Talking about the old one that I posted pictures of on the discord.

626
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,000
And I was like, oh, yeah, I did.

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,480
And she was like, oh, yeah, I was just wondering about that.

628
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,840
And I was like, oh, yeah.

629
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,920
Anyway, PVP, let's, let's battle Pokemon Go.

630
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
Deliberately doesn't take off hat.

631
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,760
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

632
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,080
Yeah.

633
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,640
Um, so I've been, you've been lying to everyone.

634
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,600
I've been deceiving them.

635
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,160
Oh, but it's okay.

636
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,840
I know the truth has to come out at some point.

637
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,240
So it might as well come out here on the podcast in front of like.

638
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
It'll force you to adapt.

639
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,920
Thousands of people.

640
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,800
Accept it.

641
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Yep.

642
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,360
Yep.

643
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,440
Yep.

644
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,920
That's good.

645
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,680
So what else is going on ladies and gentlemen?

646
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,560
Hi, I have a story, a small story.

647
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,600
I finally picked up pens and pencils after seven years of not drawing traditionally.

648
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,560
And I like it.

649
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,040
Oh no.

650
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,400
Is it good?

651
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Have you lost skill?

652
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,760
I, I, I, I apparently I have, I have a, I have an art style that I didn't know I have.

653
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah.

654
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,600
It's really good.

655
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
And it's different from your usual stuff.

656
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,760
It's shaded really nice, but in a different, I mean your shading is usually pretty nice.

657
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,960
But there are any examples we could look at on like for the show notes on like Twitter.

658
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,360
So yeah, yeah.

659
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,520
Hold on.

660
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,000
The sense, it has a, you, you draw a very, it made your, I don't know,

661
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
something about the way you drew it with traditionally, it felt very dynamic.

662
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,080
Yeah.

663
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,440
It added dynamism.

664
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,880
Dynamism.

665
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,000
Dynamism.

666
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,680
It's your usual style.

667
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm pretty sure you can just say dynamic.

668
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,520
It added dynamic too.

669
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,200
No, dynamism is when you died in NAMM.

670
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
And now you are an ism.

671
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,240
And you have a tism about it.

672
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Yeah, exactly.

673
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Oh yeah, it looks pretty cool.

674
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,040
I like it.

675
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,760
I like it.

676
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,800
I like, I like the hair.

677
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,240
I really like the way the hair looks.

678
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,800
Oh yeah, it's pretty good.

679
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,080
It's like a character from Spawn.

680
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,440
A little bit.

681
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,200
I dig the shading a lot.

682
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,040
I like characters with no mouths.

683
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I generally find that I prefer.

684
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,000
Especially women.

685
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,520
Everyone's, I feel like I prefer everyone's traditional art over there digital.

686
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,480
Like when I see, I'm just more impressed when I see like a, you know,

687
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,480
it's just more of your, more of your mark comes through no matter what.

688
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
Like, that's true.

689
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,040
And especially in a case like say, I love Ben's Inktober drawings a whole lot.

690
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,000
Because when you look at the digital art he does, you can tell that he has drawn

691
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the same line 8,000 times trying to get it exactly right.

692
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,760
Whereas when it's ink, like, I mean, I prefer thicker lines anyways.

693
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,080
So like having to go over the lines multiple times makes the picture cooler to me than it

694
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,680
would be if it was less rough.

695
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,880
When I did Ink, like two, two October's ago or three October's ago when I did all this,

696
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,320
a lot of people like those.

697
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,200
And I have all these Copic markers that I just don't fucking use.

698
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,360
That fucking, I always think that I should.

699
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,520
The fucking robot you drew was like the coolest thing you've ever drawn in that Inktober.

700
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,280
I didn't even, I colored that thing with like a red, like, not even a Copic.

701
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,040
I colored that with like a red, like, fine point like Sharpie.

702
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,520
And it came out really good somehow.

703
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,120
Is there a link to that we can put in the show notes?

704
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Because that's cool too.

705
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Just for comparison sake.

706
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,080
Yeah, I could find, I could find that.

707
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,720
Let me look.

708
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,760
Okay, all right.

709
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,520
I think my cat is very concerned about me doing traditional art.

710
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,360
Your cat is concerned?

711
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,520
Yeah, because I'm making noise and doing something he's not used to seeing me do.

712
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,400
Yeah, okay.

713
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,600
Is he causing any issues?

714
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,240
No, no, he's just, he's just looking at me with confusion and mulling at me.

715
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,600
It's just like, are you okay?

716
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,080
Hey, you know, on the subject of like, I don't know, doing artistic stuff a little differently

717
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,880
than normal, I was actually just proposed today.

718
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,440
I suppose I'll just say by one nexus mania, a guy I'm a big fan of and who also seems to like me,

719
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,680
he asked me if I wanted to do some like relatively professional voice acting work,

720
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,400
like with pay for like a pretty decent amount of like runtime and stuff.

721
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,960
And I was like, Nate, remember back to those youthful days when you really wanted to be

722
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,640
an anime voice actor.

723
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,840
And I was just like, so I told him like, I am interested.

724
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,360
Like if the script's bad, I'm not going to do it.

725
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,280
So like get back to me with more information and shit.

726
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,040
But I don't know, I really like nexus and I think it'd just be really cool.

727
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,400
And I'm kind of just excited to do more voice acting work stuff.

728
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,480
So, so here's my call out to everybody.

729
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,880
If you got projects that you want people to do voice acting work on and you think I'd be the man

730
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,360
for the job, fucking at me on Twitter and I will only do it for pay.

731
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,960
So I'm just letting you know right now.

732
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,240
You have to pay me whatever is an appropriate amount for my time.

733
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,960
I'm just going to warn you right now, Nate.

734
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,280
I know how much you love to hug those JKs,

735
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,080
but when you go to them conventions, you got to stay away.

736
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,720
Wait, what is it?

737
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,840
What is a JK?

738
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,080
That's a JK rolling.

739
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,920
It's a Japanese slang for high schoolers.

740
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,800
Joshi Kosei.

741
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,720
I totally knew that and wasn't pretending.

742
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,680
Okay, I get it.

743
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,200
I get what you're putting up.

744
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,480
Anyway, but yeah, I'm just saying like I've wanted to voice act.

745
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,760
People tell me I have a good voice.

746
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,720
You know, that's cool.

747
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,000
But it occurs to me that I haven't done much like like fictional character voice acting

748
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,280
outside of like like some t-baps skits for a while ago and more some more relatively recently,

749
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,080
as a matter of fact.

750
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,080
You know, speaking of voice acting, so I had to do.

751
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,760
Yeah, let me just finish my point.

752
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,480
It's just voice acting is a skill that I respect.

753
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,200
It is not just like talking into a microphone.

754
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,080
You have to inflect and get the right emotions captured and stuff.

755
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,520
So it's actually kind of exciting and I'm looking forward to opportunities to do so.

756
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,480
So, okay, that's it.

757
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,880
That's it.

758
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,760
All right, go on, Ben.

759
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:11,800
So I was, so I talked about the audiobook deal with Oolulilia and Oolulilia is dragon ass

760
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,040
because he's like, okay, we both had to make accounts on this site called ACX,

761
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,680
which is like sort of a gateway site to like iTunes and Audible and stuff.

762
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,960
And I made mine as the producer and he made his as an author and the idea is that he is supposed

763
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:35,240
to propose me a deal to like do like a split profit project thing where like I send him audio files

764
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,440
and he like accepts or denies them.

765
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,080
He did that.

766
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,280
He made the account and then he asked me like, how do I send you the request to do the thing?

767
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,760
And I was like, here's a guide.

768
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,920
Here's a full guide to like how an author should do this and like where to go.

769
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,880
And then he was like, yeah, it's pretty late.

770
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,880
And you know, I'm really addicted to Skyrim or oblivion or whatever right now.

771
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,640
So, you know, I might just get back to this later and I've been waiting for like a week,

772
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,600
maybe like a week now, maybe less than a week, but it's days.

773
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,240
And he just hasn't hit the one fucking button, the one fucking button.

774
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,640
He has to push to fucking make this thing go through.

775
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,480
Oolulilia, this is your, this is your, your one chance.

776
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,760
This is your one chance to fix this shit.

777
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,480
We bring down the full terror of the PCB.

778
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,720
Look, I don't know where he has to look because I'm not, I don't have his kind of account,

779
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,280
but there's just like one fucking button he has to push.

780
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,200
He just has to send me like one thing.

781
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,320
And I know the feeling.

782
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,080
He's probably just been busy and doesn't want to take the five minutes it's going to take to do it.

783
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,800
I get it.

784
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,480
I as a, as a, as a chronic ass-dragger myself, I get it.

785
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
I've seen what Elder Scrolls does to people and I'm not surprised that this is the outcome.

786
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,120
Anyway, here's that, here's that tweet.

787
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,200
Here's that, here's that robot drawing that I did.

788
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Oh, okay, sick, sick.

789
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,720
Um, but anyway.

790
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,280
Oh, that's so cool.

791
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Thank you.

792
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,560
It's like Amy Rose Gundam.

793
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,360
I really, I really like the, the, uh, what's it called?

794
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,640
Like with the, with the fires and like in the, on the ground and the-

795
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,440
Jet propulsion.

796
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

797
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,440
I bet it's like blasting off the ground.

798
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,800
Yeah, I really like that effect.

799
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,360
Yes.

800
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,720
I think, I like this.

801
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,800
Watch me tie this into current relevant topics because Ben, I believe you drew this

802
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,680
not long after reading volume one of Battle Angel Alita.

803
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,720
Oh, it looks like something from that.

804
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,000
I might, it was around that time.

805
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,440
But wait, now there's a live action film adaptation.

806
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,080
Before we, I will, we'll talk about that, although I haven't seen it.

807
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,400
But before we say that, I just want to say that on the voice acting, I had to do voices

808
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,000
for the different characters in Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.

809
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,880
And one of the things that I'm very unsure about and very like,

810
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,560
not sure what the best thing to do about it is the book is written like a screenplay

811
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,440
and you, it'll, it'll say like character's name and then the dialogue.

812
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,840
It doesn't have like, you know, John said, Knuckles said, Steve said.

813
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,800
And I'm not sure whether it would be, like I tried to just do the voices so that you

814
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,400
could tell who was doing who.

815
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't know if I could differentiate them enough.

816
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,280
I don't know.

817
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,160
Like I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and like say their name.

818
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,520
You know, like say like, you know, Tyler.

819
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,000
That's a good question for him to clarify.

820
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,680
Well, I don't, I don't necessarily trust his judgment.

821
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,160
Okay.

822
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,480
Okay.

823
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,360
Fair enough.

824
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,760
I don't know.

825
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,840
Yeah, you'll have to make a call there.

826
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,960
That's, that's interesting though.

827
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,800
I might like listen back to it and be like, kind of like, is it distinct enough?

828
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,520
Do you, can you tell when two is talking or when our science teacher is talking?

829
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,440
Remember our boy, name I can't remember, guy who did all the Harry Potter books.

830
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Who, you know.

831
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,480
Yes.

832
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,360
Um, um, not, not, not really the trees.

833
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
He did the, he did Game of Thrones audiobooks.

834
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,480
Um, I can't remember.

835
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,680
My mom like loved him more than my father.

836
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
She ever loved him.

837
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,880
Jim Hennig.

838
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,040
No, I can't remember whoever that guy was.

839
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,160
He, he knocked it out of the park and he did a great job differentiating like every voice.

840
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,880
Jim Dale.

841
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,600
Jim Dale.

842
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,240
Jim Dale.

843
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,960
That's the guy.

844
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,080
That's the guy.

845
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,880
Stephen Fry.

846
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,440
Actually Stephen Fry did narrate them the, in the UK,

847
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,680
but Jim Dale narrated the USA version.

848
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,160
I wonder why.

849
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,840
What they do differently.

850
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,640
Well, whatever.

851
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,120
Anyway.

852
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,840
Oh, Harry.

853
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
Oh, Harry.

854
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,600
Harry.

855
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,480
No.

856
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,880
Cool.

857
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,040
That was the Ron line.

858
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,160
The classic Ron line.

859
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,400
Just whenever anyone says cool, the way he says it is cool.

860
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,200
And it's great.

861
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,160
It's not even bad.

862
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,880
It's good.

863
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,280
Yeah.

864
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,920
It's just good.

865
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
Um, okay.

866
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,680
But anyway, when, when Hermione says Harry, she says,

867
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,640
Harry, oh, Harry, oh, Harry.

868
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,200
What do you, what do you fuck?

869
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,600
It's good.

870
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,080
It's good.

871
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,880
How does Stephen Fry say, say, cool?

872
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
Does he say the same thing, Gib?

873
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,040
Did you listen to that?

874
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,040
Well, yeah, I did listen to those.

875
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,000
I just don't know how, like, I can't, I mean, I can't remember.

876
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Look it up now, Gib.

877
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,800
It probably wasn't nearly, it probably wasn't nearly as distinctive.

878
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,440
Yeah.

879
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,640
Is Jim Dale American?

880
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,320
No, he's British.

881
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,120
He's British too.

882
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,200
I don't think so.

883
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,840
Okay.

884
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,640
So then, yeah.

885
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,160
They just got two different British guys

886
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,160
to do the American versus like British dub of the same story.

887
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,800
Although, I mean, so I know in Britain, like the first one was

888
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,480
called the Philosopher's Stone or whatever.

889
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,080
Is there like actual translation?

890
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,400
Like, or like localization differences or something?

891
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,120
You know what I think?

892
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,760
About the book?

893
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,160
I don't know.

894
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,800
Yeah, in the book.

895
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
Wouldn't think so.

896
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,320
Don't they call it the Philosopher's Stone in the book?

897
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,280
I think in the early books, there were some like, like,

898
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,800
name convention changes made for the American versions.

899
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Why the fuck did they call it the Sorcerer's Stone?

900
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,080
Why isn't the goddamn Philosopher's Stone,

901
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,960
that's a staple fantasy item?

902
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,520
You know what?

903
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,080
I'm over it.

904
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
I've been thinking about this for 20 years.

905
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,800
I assume that there was some kind of religious connotation

906
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,680
to Philosopher's Stone.

907
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,320
Oh, you think so?

908
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,720
Maybe.

909
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't think so.

910
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,080
It's like demonic or something and they like.

911
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,280
It's a philosophy.

912
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,440
I mean, Philosopher is like, it's not like, I mean,

913
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,160
sorcery is more magical than Philosopher.

914
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
That is, I mean, that's totally, totally true.

915
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,400
Totally like more objective.

916
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,960
Those books were protested by religious people

917
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
who didn't like witchcraft in America.

918
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,360
It's very possible that it's just that they thought kids

919
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,080
would not pick up a book called Philosopher's Stone,

920
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,360
but they might pick up one called Sorcerer's Stone.

921
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,400
I read an article online.

922
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,840
About like, you know, like people being like,

923
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,120
Harry Potter is demonic.

924
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,160
You know, everyone's fucking falling into devil witchcraft.

925
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,480
Thought it was real for a long time.

926
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,560
Turned out it was an onion article

927
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,640
that had been passed around as the genuine thing.

928
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,800
And it made me fucking mad because I thought it was real.

929
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,720
I was like, oh, so no one understands.

930
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,280
It's not, I love Harry Potter.

931
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
There have been books.

932
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,720
I remember researching this for like an,

933
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,280
for an essay during my time at uni.

934
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,720
Like I researched like books that are like on Amazon

935
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,400
detailing how Harry Potter is demonic.

936
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,160
And then you can buy it.

937
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,160
And I didn't, I didn't, I decided this was stupid

938
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,440
and I wanted to do something else.

939
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,200
But I saw it.

940
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,400
It's strange.

941
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,560
Okay. So some people think it or whatever reason.

942
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,280
Yeah. Yeah.

943
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,960
That lady that claimed that like Pokemon Go was demons.

944
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Yeah.

945
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,200
Summoning demons or whatever.

946
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,880
And like they sexually blessed her in her sleep.

947
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,440
Whoa, what the fuck?

948
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,240
Whoa, okay.

949
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,520
That's a new twist on an old classic.

950
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,440
Oh, because it like appeared on top of her or something.

951
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:12,760
Yeah.

952
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,520
She got the game.

953
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,720
She turned it on.

954
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,600
AR mode was on.

955
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,960
There was a Pokemon in her room.

956
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,840
She screamed.

957
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,960
I feel like that's the next,

958
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,160
that could easily be the next, you know, thing.

959
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,640
Like.

960
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,920
Next Me Too movement.

961
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,160
Yeah.

962
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,840
We got Pokemon Molestation.

963
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,840
So I wonder if like in a lot of these cases,

964
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,720
I don't feel like people come to the conclusion

965
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,160
that a thing is witchcraft.

966
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,280
I feel like they hear somehow in the ether,

967
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
someone putting forth that,

968
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,640
and then they just also decide to believe it themselves.

969
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,880
I mean, not to be overly edgy,

970
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,200
but I do believe religion is largely linked

971
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
with straight up stupidity.

972
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,040
So, you know, we're just gonna throw that out there.

973
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,480
To anybody who believes one,

974
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm likely to think is pretty deep into the other,

975
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
or has been deeply misled, you know.

976
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,040
Dude, I'm big into the stupidity fandom.

977
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,680
Dude, I love Jesus' style.

978
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,200
All right, whatever.

979
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,560
I didn't have much to say about Battle Angel Alita,

980
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,120
because I haven't seen the movie,

981
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,840
but I have read the book.

982
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,880
A friend of mine saw it and was saying good things.

983
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,960
He said it was fun, not necessarily good,

984
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,320
but a very fun watch,

985
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,400
and everyone had a good time and laughed a lot.

986
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,640
So.

987
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,200
Okay.

988
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, so I have.

989
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
Don't know if that's what they were going for.

990
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:33,960
Yeah.

991
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,080
Yeah.

992
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,640
I would say.

993
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,840
I have read the, uh, sorry.

994
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,920
Now, now you can talk about the movie.

995
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,440
I would just say that, like, uh,

996
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,920
because I did see, I made a video about it already.

997
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Her eyes are really big, you guys.

998
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,280
I thought that was cool.

999
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,640
I think that was, I like that.

1000
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,400
If you think that's cool, you'll love it.

1001
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,640
Like, yeah.

1002
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm just wondering, in universe,

1003
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,400
like, humans don't look like that,

1004
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,200
so who made the choice to make this girl look like an anime?

1005
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,680
Well, she's a doll, so she's got big doll eyes.

1006
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,240
Yeah, she's not.

1007
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,080
She's a robot.

1008
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,560
But someone artistically, in universe,

1009
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,000
decided to make her look doll-like and not like a normal human.

1010
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,440
Someone made that choice, right?

1011
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,080
Or maybe there was a technological limitation.

1012
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,480
Well, he just kind of finds her head in the garbage.

1013
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,280
So, like, she already looks like that at the start.

1014
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,120
But, um, but yeah.

1015
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,800
Is she a curiae, or like she was human,

1016
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,000
and then, like, gets her body.

1017
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,640
She has, her brain is human.

1018
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,360
So, like, is that the case in the manga?

1019
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,880
Does she have a human brain in the manga?

1020
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
I think so, yeah.

1021
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,000
I read the first, I only read the first volume.

1022
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,440
When my friend John saw it, and the first thing I asked him was,

1023
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,440
do you see a giant robot man fucking crack people's skulls open,

1024
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,200
like chestnuts, and slurp their brains out of their skull holes,

1025
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
like ice cream scoops?

1026
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,080
And he said no, and I was like, well.

1027
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,560
It is a PG-13 movie, but there is some intense violence

1028
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,920
that happens in it for being PG-13, and it's dark,

1029
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,920
just as dark as the, I mean, if you've seen the original OVA,

1030
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,600
like, literally everything that happens in it is also in the movie.

1031
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,560
So it's like a huge spoiler to even go watch the OVA.

1032
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,520
But, uh, yeah, it's, it's a, I think you'll,

1033
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,880
I think you will enjoy it.

1034
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,800
If you think that her eyes look cool, you'll enjoy the movie.

1035
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,320
I think, well, I think they look weird,

1036
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,720
but I think that that's intentional, and it makes sense,

1037
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,160
and I don't mind it, you know?

1038
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,000
That's the way, that's the right way to do it.

1039
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,640
I read the manga of that, the first two volumes, I think,

1040
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,680
when I was 12, and it was like the edgiest, like, deadliest,

1041
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,680
there were boobies in it, there was blood, there was killing,

1042
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,960
it was like, oh, oh, oh no!

1043
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,160
There's a scene, I read it, I borrowed it from you, Digi,

1044
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,000
and I read it at your house, and I remember the scene,

1045
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,320
it's like, the guy, the robot guy, he's done that,

1046
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,840
he's holding like a woman, and he's, and he's bitten her head open,

1047
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,720
and just like, slurped her brain out, and Alita like,

1048
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,360
is jumping at him to attack him, and he just like,

1049
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,040
tosses this like, body at her, and she's like tumbling,

1050
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,960
and she's like tumbling through the end, like her dead eyes,

1051
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,560
or like, and her like, head is like, open,

1052
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,440
and she's naked in her hairs, and I was like,

1053
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,240
I was like, so chilled, I was like, so chilled by this image,

1054
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,760
and even thinking about it now.

1055
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,680
When I think about it, it's funny, because like,

1056
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,080
I've seen the OVA a bunch of times over the years,

1057
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,840
and read the first volume of the manga,

1058
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,680
and my impression of it was always just like,

1059
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,600
Mad Max, Violence, Madness, you know,

1060
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,320
it's just 80s, 80s, Violence, Dijour,

1061
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,960
so that's kind of how I painted it in my video about the movie,

1062
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,760
but then like, fans of the manga were all like,

1063
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,040
swarming me like, no, it is absolutely about the story,

1064
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,880
it's not just violent craziness,

1065
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,000
you just got to get like, three or four volumes in,

1066
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,280
or whatever, and then it's like, oh,

1067
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,080
it's just this masterpiece of storytelling and artwork,

1068
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,680
and I was like, maybe it becomes that.

1069
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,040
All right, I guess, I mean,

1070
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,520
definitely the early volumes are definitely

1071
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,640
just Mad Max insanity, but, sure, sure.

1072
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,760
You know, so I guess,

1073
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,040
I mean, if their goal is to adapt the OVA to live action,

1074
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,080
then if it did that.

1075
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,800
I mean, they added in definitely a lot of plot points

1076
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,680
from later into the manga to just explain things more,

1077
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,760
because the OVA is just like,

1078
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,920
basically two random disconnected stories

1079
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,520
from the manga, from early on,

1080
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,240
that like, don't really give you much of a sense of the world,

1081
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,800
or like, what's, like, it doesn't really give you a sense

1082
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,120
of the idea that there is more to it,

1083
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,360
whereas the movie adds in a lot of detail

1084
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,920
that gives you the sense that there's a lot more going on,

1085
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,120
and they leave it very open for a sequel as well.

1086
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,760
So is, I've been hearing, I've been hearing people say this,

1087
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,920
and I forget if you went into this in any detail,

1088
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,600
but like, is this the first non-horrible, like,

1089
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,240
anime adaptation?

1090
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,280
Speed Racer!

1091
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,680
Oh, okay, I forgot Speed Racer.

1092
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,040
Nate, didn't we watch Speed Racer, like, together

1093
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,880
when we were, like, in high school or something?

1094
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,080
I don't remember if we watched it together.

1095
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,480
I think I remember watching it in the basement.

1096
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,160
That's possible, I remember loving it.

1097
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,360
I loved it, yeah.

1098
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,400
It was dope as hell.

1099
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,200
I loved it.

1100
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,080
It's my favorite movie.

1101
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,520
It's so fun.

1102
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,200
And then I found out later that it was, like, you know,

1103
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,640
a sort of, it was sort of unpopular with, like, a lot of people.

1104
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,920
It was totally panned.

1105
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,520
It was entirely panned.

1106
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,400
And I was shocked.

1107
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,680
You just get ready for it, I don't think.

1108
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,520
But I only found this out at, like,

1109
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,760
I think it was Egoraptor was defending it or something,

1110
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,000
or some people were saying, like, this movie's,

1111
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,200
like, when I, the time that I heard that the movie was maligned,

1112
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,480
it was when I heard people saying,

1113
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,240
this movie is unfairly maligned,

1114
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,920
and actually it's great in a masterpiece,

1115
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,400
and I was like, hey, I didn't know anyone was panning it,

1116
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,360
but good on you.

1117
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:18,840
Good.

1118
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,120
Thanks for defending this movie.

1119
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,320
I didn't know it was being attacked.

1120
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,320
I had heard nothing positive about it until Egoraptor,

1121
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,040
and then, and Film Crit Hulk then said it was, like,

1122
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,160
one of his favorite movies.

1123
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,280
And when I read his review,

1124
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,800
it's what inspired me to go watch it.

1125
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,200
And I was like, holy fuck, this is the best movie ever.

1126
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,120
Yeah, everyone should definitely watch it immediately,

1127
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,720
especially if you're an anime fan at all.

1128
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,840
I definitely think, well,

1129
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,880
the thing is a lot of fans of Speed Racer hate the movie

1130
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,400
because it's not an accurate Speed Racer movie, per se.

1131
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,960
How many of those are left from the fucking 50s?

1132
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,200
Who is a fan of original Speed Racer?

1133
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,920
How many?

1134
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,120
Yeah, exactly.

1135
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,760
You know, it's fine.

1136
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,480
I totally get it.

1137
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm sure there's a great lore, and it, you know,

1138
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,640
I would absolutely be the kind of guy who would be

1139
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,080
ragging on the movie for not being a good enough adaptation

1140
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,480
if I was a fan of Speed Racer,

1141
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,240
which I've never seen in my life.

1142
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,160
So I totally sympathize with that,

1143
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,960
but what we have is just so good on its own.

1144
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,680
Here's the thing.

1145
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,520
The original Speed Racer is like a landmark moment

1146
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,960
in animation and cartoons generally,

1147
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,720
and it's like a cultural touchstone.

1148
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,800
It doesn't need defending, you know?

1149
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,520
Yeah, that's true.

1150
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,600
It doesn't need advocates, it's fine.

1151
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,320
And the new movie, its strengths are very different

1152
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,480
from the strengths of the original Speed Racer,

1153
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
like that, whatever, that revolutionized anime

1154
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,360
or something, whatever.

1155
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,680
By new, you mean like 10 years old.

1156
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,240
Sure, yeah.

1157
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,160
Wait, are you talking about the new movie

1158
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,760
or the original animation?

1159
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,360
I'm talking about the Speed Racer movie.

1160
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,520
It's like 12 years old.

1161
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,080
Yeah, yeah.

1162
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,240
I mean, I was gonna, like, but the original,

1163
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,160
what it's got, its strength, it's got its own story.

1164
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,760
This new one is like a visual masterpiece,

1165
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,440
like the feeling of like-

1166
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,920
It is a camp, it is a camp feast, extravaganza.

1167
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,600
And I just don't think that, like,

1168
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,760
at all was what hardcore Speed Racer fans

1169
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,560
like were into Speed Racer original for.

1170
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,440
So like, it's a totally different-

1171
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,560
Not at all.

1172
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,080
So I could see them being not happy with that,

1173
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,760
but for those of us who never gave a shit

1174
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
about Speed Racer, particularly to begin with,

1175
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,360
you know, we can be less biased.

1176
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,840
I will add as well that while Speed Racer and Alita

1177
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,120
might be the only two good, like, Hollywood

1178
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,560
live-action anime adaptations,

1179
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,320
there are tons of good live-action anime from Japan,

1180
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,840
like where they just, you know,

1181
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,080
they make tons of live-action adaptations.

1182
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,360
I always wanted to see the Death Note ones that I hear are good.

1183
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,440
The Death Note ones are not that good, I would not-

1184
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,560
I want to tell us, it's like, is there a

1185
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,920
live-action attack on Titan?

1186
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,120
Is it good, if it exists?

1187
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,000
There is one.

1188
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,520
I don't know if it's good.

1189
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,320
I like the live-action Rony Kenshin movies.

1190
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,760
Kashern has a really interesting one.

1191
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,560
I mean, there's tons.

1192
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,520
I was just looking at lists,

1193
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,040
and there's just like an endless sea

1194
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,280
of live-action anime adaptations.

1195
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Stuff that I would never have imagined,

1196
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,440
like in Tama, has like a live-action film.

1197
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,560
Like, there's all kinds of shit.

1198
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,640
My friend who saw Alita yesterday,

1199
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,080
he said that he said,

1200
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,320
like, everyone in the theater was laughing.

1201
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:05,640
And so-

1202
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,520
So that doesn't sound good.

1203
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,160
That sounds bad.

1204
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:07,800
It doesn't sound good.

1205
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,280
I don't think that the movie is a-

1206
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:10,600
Is it funny?

1207
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,280
I mean, it's a Robert Rodriguez movie.

1208
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,520
Like, they're all cheesy on purpose.

1209
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,680
They're always like, you know,

1210
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,280
so the movie is extremely fucking corny.

1211
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,960
But like, you don't get the sense

1212
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,800
that it doesn't know that.

1213
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,640
Now, it's not all in a good way,

1214
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,880
because like, a lot of the side actors

1215
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,920
are fucking terrible.

1216
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,760
Like, there's plenty of like villains

1217
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,760
who's just acting is so bad

1218
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,120
that it is cringe-worthy.

1219
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,960
And sometimes Alita's facial expressions

1220
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,440
get really uncanny or the dialogue is-

1221
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, sometimes the dialogue is really corny

1222
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,280
and you could tell it's on purpose,

1223
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,560
but you hate it anyways.

1224
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,240
And other times it's corny,

1225
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,320
but it works and it's fun.

1226
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,120
But like, if you go into it with the mindset

1227
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,760
that like, this is a movie I can laugh at

1228
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,040
and that is fine,

1229
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,880
then you will probably have a good time with it.

1230
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,480
Yeah, all right.

1231
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,520
I could see myself-

1232
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,960
I mean, my instincts are like,

1233
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,840
okay, I'm ready for Ghost in the Shell Zero here.

1234
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,960
Let's, you know, ramp up-

1235
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,720
It's a lot better than-

1236
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,760
How do you guys feel?

1237
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,240
I feel a little gross

1238
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,120
when I see that it's an American adaptation.

1239
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,720
Like, I, like,

1240
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,520
I mean, I haven't seen the movie,

1241
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,880
I don't know if it's good personally,

1242
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,680
but like, the way they did,

1243
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,200
they did the American remake

1244
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,360
of fucking Ghost in the Shell.

1245
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,200
They did the American remake of Old Boy.

1246
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,280
Now they did this American version

1247
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,640
of Battle Angel Alita.

1248
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,000
I hate that shit.

1249
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,200
On principle, I hate it.

1250
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,240
It makes me feel dirty.

1251
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,800
It's gross.

1252
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,120
I want to see fucking Japanese people

1253
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,000
in these fucking-

1254
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,600
Ordinarily, ordinarily, I would avoid these movies.

1255
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,880
Like, I didn't see Ghost in the Shell

1256
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
or the American Old Boy,

1257
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
but like, the thing about those movies

1258
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,240
is that they were clearly like studio movies

1259
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,920
with like an attached director

1260
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,160
where it was just about like using an IP.

1261
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,320
With this case, James Cameron

1262
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,880
has wanted to make this movie for an eternity.

1263
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,760
And like, he's clearly just a huge fan

1264
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,440
of Battle Angel Alita

1265
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,360
and he like worked with Robert,

1266
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,560
you know, Robert Rubio directed it,

1267
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,600
but he worked with him on it

1268
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,320
and like, I think James Cameron even co-wrote it

1269
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,960
and like, when you watch it, like I said,

1270
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,720
if, I'm sure Cameron was mostly a fan of the old OVA

1271
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,040
because it is visually really distinctive

1272
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,280
and has super memorable moments in it.

1273
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,600
So I think that like, literally every second

1274
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,920
of the OVA, practically, is in the movie.

1275
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,400
Like, it's so accurate that it's,

1276
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,640
it might as well have used it as like a storyboard,

1277
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,560
you know, and then everything they added in

1278
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,840
is stuff from the manga.

1279
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,720
So like, it, and none of the people

1280
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,480
who have read the manga seem to have any problem

1281
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,840
with the story or the way it's told.

1282
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,680
And like, it's also not a story about Japanese people.

1283
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,360
It's set in like a melting pot post-apocalypse,

1284
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,640
you know, world where there's people of all races.

1285
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,600
And like, Christoph Waltz plays Doc Edo

1286
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,840
and he looks exactly like him.

1287
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,400
Like, it's, I was like, oh my God.

1288
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,720
Like, yes, that was exactly who they should get

1289
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,440
to play this role.

1290
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,000
It's perfect.

1291
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,480
And he does a great job, of course,

1292
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,760
because he's Christoph Waltz,

1293
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,000
but most of the acting is pretty fucking terrible.

1294
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,640
I mean, fair enough.

1295
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,280
Fair enough.

1296
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,600
Also, I want to clarify that I know Old Boy is Korean,

1297
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,800
not Japanese.

1298
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,640
It is based on a manga, though.

1299
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,360
Or I don't know.

1300
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,920
Oh, really?

1301
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,800
I had no idea.

1302
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,400
I think it's based on a manga.

1303
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,320
I think it's actually based on a Japanese manga.

1304
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:21,960
Let me look it up.

1305
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,000
Okay.

1306
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,480
Well, that's cool.

1307
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,120
I mean, either way, the movie, you know,

1308
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,320
but that's the thing, that's the thing.

1309
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,440
Let's just say that it's a,

1310
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,040
let's say it's a Japanese manga.

1311
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,680
Yeah, it is.

1312
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
It is, in fact, a Japanese manga that's based on it.

1313
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay.

1314
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,960
So that's interesting.

1315
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,640
Because like, okay, what right does,

1316
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,760
let's just say for, I mean,

1317
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,040
I don't believe in this kind of division stuff, necessarily.

1318
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,360
I see the point of like,

1319
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,640
if you're telling a Japanese story,

1320
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,080
like about Japanese people,

1321
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,080
like, you know, about Japanese lore

1322
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,400
or current politics or any of that stuff,

1323
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,720
then like, it seems pretty logical

1324
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,440
to like make it with Japanese actors and whatnot.

1325
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,400
But like, are Koreans so similar to Japanese?

1326
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,480
The Asians all fucking hate each other,

1327
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,520
as I understand it.

1328
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,440
Yeah, I guess so.

1329
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,280
So I mean, what is what more important,

1330
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,160
like the artistry that the new people like bring to it

1331
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,640
and if they honor like, you know, what's,

1332
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,400
because Old Boy is like one of the most beloved movies

1333
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,480
of all time, by like, film buffs.

1334
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,560
I mean, Old Boy is by far the most egregious,

1335
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,040
because like, there's already a live action movie.

1336
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,200
It didn't need a remake, like Ghost in the Shell

1337
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,520
and Alita don't have live action versions.

1338
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,160
So I guess, yeah, it's as fair game for an American

1339
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,480
to make as an Asian or whatever.

1340
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,320
And then you just judge on like, how it came out.

1341
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,880
I'd say.

1342
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,600
Yeah.

1343
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,320
Yeah.

1344
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,040
But like...

1345
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,840
And the Death Note.

1346
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,880
The, the, the...

1347
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,640
Oh yeah, that's true.

1348
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,160
I haven't, I haven't seen Death Note, but like,

1349
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,600
I don't know, but just when I see,

1350
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,040
when I see a manga or something that's played by,

1351
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,680
I see a white person playing light Yagami,

1352
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,960
I'm like, oh God, I want to fucking barf, you know?

1353
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,680
Yeah.

1354
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,880
I have a visceral reaction to it.

1355
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,360
I just realized like, Death Note kind of pulled

1356
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,040
like Dragon Ball Z live actions.

1357
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,800
She's like, they just put it in high school.

1358
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:56,680
Uh.

1359
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,760
Oh yeah, Dragon Ball Z too.

1360
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,520
Well, I mean, Gohan was in high school

1361
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,880
for parts of Dragon Ball Z.

1362
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,120
So I, you know, maybe they're going to lean into that.

1363
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,920
Sure.

1364
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,480
I don't know.

1365
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,280
Sure.

1366
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,520
He was Dragon Ball Z set in high school?

1367
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,480
When Go, after Cell was defeated and Gohan...

1368
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,840
No, no, not the anime.

1369
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,640
I mean, the, the...

1370
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,080
The live action adaptation.

1371
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,720
The remake.

1372
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,680
Was there a Canadian, right?

1373
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,480
It was a Canadian?

1374
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,680
I don't, I don't remember.

1375
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,760
I just remember he went to high school and, and stuff.

1376
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,200
I mean, the fact of the matter is,

1377
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,520
I don't think anyone would complain about any of these cases

1378
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,040
if the movies were good.

1379
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,880
Like, nobody would care if it was a white guy

1380
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,400
if it was a great movie.

1381
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,120
Light Yagami was literally a high school student.

1382
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,640
And like, if you adapt it, you could,

1383
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,960
as they chose to do in the, in the Netflix version,

1384
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,360
you could lean into him being like a high school student.

1385
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,080
But Light Yagami was never defined by that,

1386
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,560
or like, his like weird crush they gave.

1387
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,040
Okay, hang on.

1388
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,640
Let me finish my point.

1389
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Light Yagami was like a borderline sociopathic,

1390
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,880
obvious God complex narcissist,

1391
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,000
who was so much better than the people around him

1392
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,800
and was actually, so this was not a delusion

1393
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,000
that like, he felt it was his God given right

1394
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,160
to judge who should live and who should die.

1395
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,240
This is not the kind of fucking character

1396
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,160
as depicted in the original stories

1397
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,640
who waste his time chasing pussy.

1398
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,840
He doesn't give a shit.

1399
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,680
He could get any pussy he wants

1400
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,360
because he's so fucking competent

1401
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,880
and he does consistently.

1402
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,480
So to paint him that way, well, with Misa Misa,

1403
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,920
she's like a, she's like an idol.

1404
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,720
It is implied.

1405
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,080
He doesn't even like her.

1406
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,200
Well, okay, but

1407
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,280
the point, he's above that.

1408
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,160
He's above worrying about that.

1409
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,920
And he could get any girl he wanted

1410
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,200
because the girls were constantly

1411
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,360
fawning over him when he was in college, especially.

1412
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,240
Absolutely, sure.

1413
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,800
And look at what's her face from after L dies

1414
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,760
and there's the time skip.

1415
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,960
There's that like newscaster

1416
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,240
who also falls in love with him.

1417
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,240
He gets like the cream of the crop is my point.

1418
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,760
Like all the top sluts want Yagami's cock real bad

1419
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,240
in addition to the lowly gutter sluts as well.

1420
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,720
What's your point in all this?

1421
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,520
My point is, what is wrong with the adaptation

1422
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,600
is that they misunderstood and I mean,

1423
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,120
I would argue maybe they understood,

1424
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,680
but they made bad changes to the character

1425
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,480
as opposed like you could make light Yagami American

1426
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,480
that would come with baggage that you have to adapt it

1427
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,000
to like the American political system

1428
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,440
and the American policing system

1429
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,040
that are different from Japanese

1430
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,640
and are integral to the story.

1431
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,400
What white light, white light.

1432
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,720
That's a funny name for him.

1433
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,920
White light, white light's first kill with the death note.

1434
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,000
Trump, he just writes Donald Trump in the death note.

1435
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,040
First thing.

1436
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,640
I mean, yeah, yeah.

1437
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,280
Oh, never mind.

1438
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,280
I thought there was a live action Yu-Gi-Oh! movie

1439
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,400
for a second, but it was just.

1440
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,720
You know, they're making the second death note movie

1441
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,080
for Netflix though, right?

1442
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,720
Do you remember that?

1443
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,120
No, no.

1444
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,000
Geez.

1445
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,600
At least, I've got to double check that

1446
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,400
because I think that's true.

1447
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,440
Apparently, I'm looking at the list of all of the

1448
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,960
live action adaptations of manga and from the US,

1449
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,720
there's not as many as I would have thought.

1450
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,320
You've got Alita, the Giver,

1451
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,320
which they made two of back in the early 90s.

1452
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:53,960
I remember that.

1453
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,560
Death Note, Dragon Ball Evolution,

1454
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,520
Fist of the North Star, which I don't know.

1455
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,400
Yeah, Death Note 2 is in the works at Netflix for some reason.

1456
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,720
Ghost in the Shell, Old Boy, Speed Racer,

1457
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,320
and then I see TBA on Akira,

1458
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,560
which has been in the works for an eternity,

1459
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,840
and Naruto.

1460
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,040
Yes.

1461
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,960
So a Naruto live action is, I guess, on my way.

1462
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,040
Oh, I don't know what the status of this is.

1463
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,760
Are they going to do the Naruto running?

1464
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,560
God, I hope so.

1465
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,120
I can't wait.

1466
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,720
I mean, there's been discussion for a long time

1467
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,560
about a live action one piece TV adaptation

1468
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,640
for the West, and that's coming.

1469
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,080
There is, in fact, a Bleach live action show

1470
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,680
running in Japan right now, I think.

1471
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:38,840
Cray.

1472
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,280
I mean, that would work better for Bleach,

1473
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,160
I think, than one piece.

1474
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,360
Yeah, Bleach kind of makes sense.

1475
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,920
It didn't even look terrible from what I saw.

1476
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,760
One piece will be a nightmare,

1477
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,040
and I'm very excited just to see how depraved

1478
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,000
it goes.

1479
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,440
Yeah, to CG an arm.

1480
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,640
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1481
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,440
Is this confirmed?

1482
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,760
Is a live action American?

1483
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,120
Is it American?

1484
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,960
Let me double check.

1485
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,520
Let me check.

1486
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,840
Who's looking forward to Netflix Cowboy Bebop?

1487
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,520
Yeah, that's...

1488
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,120
No.

1489
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,520
There's a commercial for it, apparently.

1490
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,680
Um, okay, well, if, I mean, if one piece is dub,

1491
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,240
if the way they handle the dub is any indication,

1492
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,560
then one piece, the remake,

1493
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,480
will be a fucking shit show nightmare.

1494
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,720
I mean, you don't need to look to the dub to...

1495
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,040
One piece is not...

1496
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,880
One piece couldn't even survive the transition

1497
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,240
into anime smoothly, much less a fucking live action.

1498
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,080
At times it did, but check it out,

1499
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,080
there's a trailer we'll put in the show notes.

1500
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,040
I guess it's actually Japanese, so okay.

1501
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
And it looks like they did a...

1502
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,240
Wow, yeah, Nami looks fucking weird.

1503
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,440
That looks fucking weird.

1504
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,560
I think Nami should have been white.

1505
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,560
Look at the giant reindeer that is chopper.

1506
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,400
He's like a big fucking reindeer.

1507
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,720
I think I've changed my mind of Nami should be white.

1508
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,360
This is wrong.

1509
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,880
She looks weird.

1510
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
One piece characters have nationalities,

1511
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,760
as confirmed by Oda.

1512
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,720
Nami, I think, is Swedish.

1513
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,120
What's Nami's?

1514
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,760
Nami's Swedish.

1515
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,440
Okay, Swedish.

1516
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,720
Okay, I like that they are very show accurate.

1517
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,320
They are super show accurate.

1518
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,200
These look, oh my gosh.

1519
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,160
That's always how it is

1520
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,240
at the Japanese live action adaptations.

1521
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,200
They're always like,

1522
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,480
they go out of their way to make sure

1523
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,760
it looks exactly like it.

1524
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,360
They look like cosplayers.

1525
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,480
They don't look like characters.

1526
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,400
The thing is though, they look kind of weirdly...

1527
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,480
Like, one piece is a cartoon, right?

1528
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,800
And these look like big meaty scars on Luffy's scar

1529
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,360
and big slices out of Zoro's face,

1530
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,600
or he has his scars, and it's weird.

1531
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,000
And Nami's tits are unsettlingly large.

1532
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,400
It's kind of strange.

1533
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Sanji is like eyebrow.

1534
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,600
It looks like a stick was glued to his face.

1535
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,600
It looks like they drew it on with eyeliner.

1536
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah, which I'm sure they did.

1537
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,840
Okay, let me walk back.

1538
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,000
I actually think it would have been really cool

1539
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,880
if maybe Zoro and Luffy were Asian,

1540
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,080
and then Sanji, Nami, and were white.

1541
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,160
I think having a mixed race cast

1542
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,760
would be really cool and really fitting

1543
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,800
in a one piece adaptation.

1544
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,600
It would be very fitting.

1545
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,960
They're from all over the world, so yeah.

1546
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,120
Yeah.

1547
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,040
But what can you do?

1548
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,840
Oh well.

1549
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,960
Okay, anyway, enough about all this business.

1550
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,480
So have you guys watched Thunderbolt Fantasy?

1551
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:22,760
No.

1552
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,880
Is that the puppet show?

1553
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,280
Yes.

1554
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,040
I have no.

1555
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,000
But it looks really...

1556
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,880
Oh my fucking face, right?

1557
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,120
It's Gennaribuchi, right?

1558
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,360
Yeah.

1559
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,400
Yeah.

1560
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,880
It looks cool, but I haven't seen it.

1561
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,600
It's good.

1562
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,240
I like it.

1563
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,320
What do you like about it?

1564
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,320
It's like, at first I didn't think I would like it.

1565
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,920
After the first episode, I was like,

1566
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,560
but then the writing is surprisingly good.

1567
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,360
It's kind of cheesy, but good cheesy,

1568
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,160
and I could really appreciate the cheesiness.

1569
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,240
It would have to be cheesy to get over the hubo.

1570
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:55,880
How long is it?

1571
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,280
Because I actually want to give it a shot.

1572
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
I think there's two seasons on a movie.

1573
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,480
Yeah.

1574
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,160
There was a...

1575
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,600
Season one was like 12 episodes back in 2016,

1576
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,840
and now they've made a second one more recently.

1577
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,960
The movie made me so sad.

1578
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,120
Yeah.

1579
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,240
Was it tragic?

1580
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,160
It was kind of, yeah.

1581
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,360
Yeah, it was.

1582
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,400
Not even kinder.

1583
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:19,880
It was.

1584
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,560
Damn, let's go.

1585
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,520
Have you seen it, Digi?

1586
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,400
I watched, like, I think six or seven episodes of season one.

1587
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,000
I ended up dropping it, but just because it's...

1588
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,160
It's just written very, like, keep...

1589
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,680
Like, everything's mysterious.

1590
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,120
Like, you don't...

1591
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,840
I hate that kind of writing in general,

1592
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,520
where it's just like constantly...

1593
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,520
Suggesting that there's more going on,

1594
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,360
but not giving you enough information.

1595
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,480
I mean, of course, I know it will eventually divulge everything,

1596
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,000
but I just got sick of it.

1597
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,960
But, like, I...

1598
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,720
The visuals are really cool.

1599
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,960
Like, it's basically a Tokusatsu show with puppets as the main characters.

1600
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,080
I was just gonna say that, yeah,

1601
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,680
it reminds me of Kamen Rider and shit.

1602
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah.

1603
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:02,760
How fucking...

1604
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,160
I don't know, I think that's just neat as hell.

1605
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,080
Incidentally...

1606
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,600
Nifty is what it is.

1607
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,240
You know what...

1608
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,240
You know where everyone needs to start turning their attention soon

1609
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,160
is to fucking Chinese anime.

1610
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,000
Because over the last, like, four years,

1611
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,040
China has been doing all these, like, Japanese co-productions

1612
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,560
through this company, Howliners.

1613
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,760
And, like, at first, most of them were, like...

1614
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,760
Not...

1615
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,520
They're all fairly high quality,

1616
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,080
but, like, most of them just felt, like, anime,

1617
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,440
but made by China, and it was really weird and jarring.

1618
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
But over time, some of...

1619
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,280
There's just been some really fucking great shows coming out of there.

1620
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,800
And, like, when we're in a period where anime is looking worse and worse,

1621
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
the Chinese anime looks great.

1622
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,160
And, um...

1623
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,640
Yeah.

1624
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,520
There's this show called Modao Zushi that I'm three episodes into.

1625
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,560
And it just is, like...

1626
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,560
It's really mind-blowing.

1627
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,960
It's a lot like Avatar the Last Airbender,

1628
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,640
where you have that weird feeling of, like,

1629
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,280
I can tell this isn't Japanese,

1630
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,960
but it looks like anime,

1631
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,240
and it's way better than most of the anime I've seen.

1632
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,160
So, uh, I love it.

1633
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,840
I'm hearing you rave about it yesterday in the livestream.

1634
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,440
I was very curious to check it out.

1635
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,680
Speaking of anime-looking bed...

1636
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,200
Oh, did you want to say something else, did you?

1637
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,560
No, just that it's mega...

1638
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,360
It's mega interesting because it is really gorgeous,

1639
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,960
and especially the background art,

1640
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,760
which is, like, my biggest problem with most anime coming out.

1641
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,840
And, like, it looks as though

1642
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,440
they probably drew the backgrounds,

1643
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,120
like, really fucking huge,

1644
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,480
and then just scaled them down,

1645
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,200
because, like, the amount of detail is just fucking absurd

1646
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,480
in a lot of the backgrounds.

1647
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:41,800
And, like...

1648
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,920
Shit, that sounds dope.

1649
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,280
So, you just have, like, these absolutely gorgeous vistas

1650
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,720
of, like, rural China and shit.

1651
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,400
And it's a, you know, it's a Wushu story style.

1652
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,160
That's why Thunderbolt Fantasy made me think of it,

1653
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,760
because it's the same type of story,

1654
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,520
where it's, like, you know, that crouching tiger,

1655
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,720
hidden dragon, like, wirefoo style of, uh, shit.

1656
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,280
But it's all, like, couched in Chinese mysticism and stuff.

1657
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,080
And, like, it's just really fucking weird,

1658
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,600
because the sensibilities of it I'm not used to,

1659
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,200
because, like, all of the wordplay

1660
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,280
or just, like, the attitudes of the characters

1661
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,920
are just something I've never experienced before,

1662
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,080
because I don't know enough Chinese media, you know?

1663
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,760
I was gonna say, after having consumed

1664
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,760
so much Japanese media, it's been...

1665
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,680
Will I ever be able to get over

1666
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,600
what's been built into me, my attitude,

1667
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,480
that the Chinese are just there for me to pillage and rape?

1668
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,200
Uh, I don't know.

1669
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,480
Fucking mainlanders.

1670
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,040
Fucking mainlanders don't even believe in ghosts.

1671
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,480
Get the fuck out of here.

1672
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,160
I mean, and the great thing about it is that, like,

1673
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,280
as weird as it is, the dialogue is really sly and interesting.

1674
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,280
Like, the character dynamics are great.

1675
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,280
Also, it is, and I didn't even know this until, like,

1676
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,400
episode three and doing additional research,

1677
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,600
is considered by many to be a BL story.

1678
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,360
And it definitely, like, you can see the trappings of it,

1679
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,760
and you're like, oh, I've seen some people argue

1680
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,680
that it's not BL, so I'm guessing it doesn't go

1681
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,040
super far with, like, you know, with them actually, like,

1682
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:04,840
fucking or anything.

1683
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,800
Could you, like, just tell me quickly the first episode?

1684
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,680
I might know what you're talking about.

1685
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,120
Uh, the first episode is about, like,

1686
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,960
a bunch of fucking zombies and shit.

1687
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:12,840
Chinese zombies.

1688
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,520
Are we still talking about Thunderbolt Fantasy?

1689
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:14,680
No.

1690
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,600
No, we're talking about Moldau Zushi.

1691
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,200
Oh, okay.

1692
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,320
Moldau Zushi.

1693
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,120
Bill...

1694
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,240
I was like, it's a little...

1695
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,960
Boy's love.

1696
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,520
Boy's love.

1697
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,160
Does the main guy die, but then, like, not die?

1698
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,560
Well, the main character is, like, a, uh...

1699
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,040
He had been dead, but he's, like, the creator of the dark arts.

1700
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,960
Like, there's sorcery in this world,

1701
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,120
and he created, like, a dark sorcery.

1702
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And the story begins with some kid who's been, like...

1703
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,280
It's like a kid who's, like, with his, um,

1704
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,720
like, living with his aunt or whatever,

1705
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,680
and, like, the aunts a bitch, and her son's an asshole,

1706
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,120
and they, like, are just constantly abusing

1707
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,200
and beating the shit out of him.

1708
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,880
So he's sacked, like, he does this, like,

1709
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,160
blood ritual to summon the spirit

1710
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,600
of the guy who created the dark arts,

1711
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,640
like, into his body.

1712
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,600
Just gives it to him.

1713
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,560
Like, he's gone.

1714
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,120
Okay.

1715
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,000
This kid is dead.

1716
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,120
He has sacrificed himself to give his body

1717
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,200
to the creator of the dark arts

1718
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,480
in exchange for him, like, murdering that whole family.

1719
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,520
And, um...

1720
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,640
It's not the one I saw.

1721
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,000
Because there was a...

1722
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,080
Another, like, I know there was a Chinese anime

1723
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,360
that was sort of BL, but, like,

1724
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,440
I couldn't get into it after the first episode.

1725
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,960
So it was just so not well written

1726
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,560
and then not likeable characters.

1727
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,240
So I'm happy to hear it's not the one.

1728
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,080
This BL is BS.

1729
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,640
It reminds me of, like, the first...

1730
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,040
The first...

1731
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,920
I read the first book of, like, the, um,

1732
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,000
the newer series by the Death Note guy.

1733
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,440
Wait, I read this at your house, Digi.

1734
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,040
Oh, Platinum End.

1735
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,600
It's... Yeah, Platinum End is also about, like,

1736
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,520
a kid who lives with, like, an aunt and uncle

1737
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,040
who, like, abuse him, and he...

1738
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,160
I don't think he murders...

1739
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,720
He doesn't... He, like, gets the uncle

1740
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,240
to murder the aunt or something.

1741
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:55,960
Something like that happens.

1742
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,800
And then the uncle goes to jail for life

1743
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,520
or something like that.

1744
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:58,680
Yeah.

1745
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,440
Never mind.

1746
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,720
Totally pointless diversion there.

1747
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,120
I know he cares.

1748
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,720
I read that as well and found it...

1749
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,120
It was alright.

1750
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,560
That's all I have to say.

1751
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,080
Yes, I would have read Volume 2

1752
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,800
if I'd had it available, but it didn't.

1753
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,240
The guy's art, you know, is great.

1754
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,400
Takashi, Obata, or whatever.

1755
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,120
Still great.

1756
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,200
It's still too good.

1757
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,680
Alright.

1758
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,040
Cool.

1759
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,000
You know, whatever.

1760
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,400
Sure.

1761
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,280
Media, anime, animation.

1762
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:22,840
Nice.

1763
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,320
Good.

1764
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,200
Whatever.

1765
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,800
I'm making real things.

1766
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,160
I'm making real animation in my own studio

1767
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,680
on my own computer right now.

1768
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,320
Well, tell me more.

1769
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,400
And, alright.

1770
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:33,960
Well, it's something that's...

1771
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,160
Tell me more.

1772
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,280
I'm telling you more.

1773
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:36,680
Okay.

1774
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,320
I've been animating the ending of Bailjiep,

1775
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,120
which has been...

1776
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,320
It has taken a while, but, like, I've been

1777
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,560
making some strides with it.

1778
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,120
It's ending?

1779
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,880
And it's, yeah.

1780
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,720
I've been working on the final animation.

1781
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,080
I felt the conclusion coming.

1782
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,760
I didn't realize it was so soon, but dope.

1783
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,320
I'm excited.

1784
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,600
Yeah.

1785
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,560
I gotta catch up.

1786
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,040
Now I'm gonna definitely read the whole thing, because...

1787
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:00,520
Yeah.

1788
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,240
I'm up to date.

1789
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,200
These guys are slackers.

1790
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,080
I'm up to date.

1791
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,640
Help me.

1792
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,600
I'm your real fan.

1793
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,800
These guys are fake fans.

1794
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:06,680
Yeah.

1795
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,200
I don't believe in being up to date.

1796
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,040
I mean, I'm, like, two years behind on One Piece.

1797
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,240
Yeah.

1798
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:13,800
Right.

1799
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,400
So, like, I've got, like, doing the animation and all that.

1800
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,520
Secretly.

1801
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,440
Now, not secretly, because it's public.

1802
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,840
Mm-hmm.

1803
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,080
Or maybe I've mentioned it somewhere public already.

1804
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,320
There's a possibility of...

1805
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,000
Oh, no, I have mentioned it publicly.

1806
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,960
Pump plushies.

1807
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,880
Yeah, that's right.

1808
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,160
That would be excellent.

1809
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,320
I am very curious how you would do that.

1810
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,520
Right.

1811
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,400
Well, I've got...

1812
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,840
There's this company that I used to get that Ryska plushie

1813
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,440
that I made just for...

1814
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,280
Because it was, you know, I just wanted it.

1815
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,000
I just wanted it.

1816
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:44,680
They do...

1817
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,520
What do you call it?

1818
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,480
Mass production now?

1819
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,440
Yeah.

1820
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:48,920
Yeah.

1821
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,440
So, I have...

1822
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,560
I've given them a design.

1823
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,880
They've got back to me with the finished little thing.

1824
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,080
And they're going to send me a sample,

1825
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,600
which is going to get here in about a month or something.

1826
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,960
And then once I say...

1827
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,760
I have the sample.

1828
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,680
Once I say a go, they're going to make a certain amount

1829
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,720
and then send them to me.

1830
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,360
And I'm thinking, if I can kickstart, you know,

1831
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,400
the cost of shipping them out to people

1832
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,840
and the cost of production for the things,

1833
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,040
I can get a few hundred or maybe a hundred and fifty

1834
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,040
of these plushies made and sent out.

1835
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:27,880
So, in time for the ending of Bailjade to drop,

1836
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,360
and it will be a whole big marketing ploy.

1837
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,760
I am extremely interested in this,

1838
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,360
and I'm going to be following the progress.

1839
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,040
I want to see how these plushies look,

1840
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,920
and I want to talk to you about your experience with this company

1841
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,840
because I'm interested in doing something similar.

1842
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,040
Well, here's what I'm curious about.

1843
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,080
Does it have to be that huge of an amount?

1844
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,360
Because I feel like you're not probably going to sell

1845
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,160
over a hundred of them unless they're cheap.

1846
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:51,800
I'm not.

1847
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,880
But what I'm wondering is,

1848
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,960
do you need to front the cost with the Kickstarter?

1849
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:57,720
I don't know.

1850
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,080
How much is it going to cost you relative

1851
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,440
to how much you're going to sell it for?

1852
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,200
Is it just so you can keep the cost low?

1853
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,320
All I want is for them to exist.

1854
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,880
I don't really need to make a big profit off of them.

1855
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,800
And also, it's an American company,

1856
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,680
so sending them to me is already going to be expensive.

1857
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,240
Right, sure.

1858
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,200
So I don't think people would be willing to pay.

1859
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,480
The prices, the amounts I could do,

1860
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,480
are 50, 100, and 150.

1861
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,720
And the higher up the number goes,

1862
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,040
obviously, the lower the cost is overall.

1863
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,800
150 is like two grand cheaper than just 50.

1864
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,160
Wait, it's cheaper to make more?

1865
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,520
Yeah, because they don't...

1866
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,080
You know how mass production works.

1867
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:45,720
You mean cheaper.

1868
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,680
Oh, you mean it's cheaper than...

1869
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,880
Like per unit or something.

1870
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,520
You're saving that much more.

1871
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,840
It would have been if you had paid the same per unit.

1872
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,960
Yeah, okay.

1873
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,280
So like if, on the Kickstarter,

1874
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,320
I would just have one tier and a certain amount of things,

1875
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,720
and once they're all filled, that's it.

1876
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,320
And I don't want the plushies to be too expensive.

1877
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,520
I asked on my Twitter how expensive people were thinking

1878
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,440
they would pay for.

1879
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,720
And a lot of people said no.

1880
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,560
So I'm hoping that with the ending of the comic,

1881
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,840
and once I have the sample,

1882
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,600
I can make a video showing you what it looks like,

1883
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,240
people will be more willing.

1884
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,760
And who knows?

1885
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,480
I'll throw out a number here that's just what I would like.

1886
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,640
Considering if I could get a punk plushie,

1887
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,680
I would consider going up to 50 bucks, I think.

1888
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,880
Beyond that, I think it starts to get rather ludicrous for me.

1889
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,880
I don't know if I would pay 50 for it.

1890
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,240
I mean, it depends on the size.

1891
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,920
I'm imagining something that's maybe like

1892
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,640
eight to 12 inches end to end.

1893
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,480
I don't have the data with me,

1894
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,760
but I did figure out certain sizes and costs.

1895
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,840
I think it's going to be about this big.

1896
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,120
I'm making a motion with my hands.

1897
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:55,880
Great.

1898
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,280
So get excited for that.

1899
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,800
I asked them to make her limbs, arms, and legs floppy

1900
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,920
so she can flop around.

1901
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,200
I am.

1902
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,720
Can you tell me that?

1903
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,400
I mean, do you mind saying the name of the service?

1904
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,360
Because I'm.

1905
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,480
He can tell you later, I guess.

1906
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,440
Well, I could if you don't.

1907
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,720
Yeah, I want to know.

1908
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,000
Oh, I don't mind.

1909
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,400
Uh, it's, uh, oh, what is it?

1910
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,560
Uh, fucking.

1911
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,520
Budsies as in like buddies, but with a Z with a Z.

1912
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,600
But with an S buds.

1913
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,320
I'll just type it.

1914
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,360
Okay.

1915
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,680
Sounds like a fucking weed website.

1916
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,400
What it is, what it actually is,

1917
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,640
is like a website where they say,

1918
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,520
send in your child's drawings and we'll make their plushies real

1919
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,200
and send them back to you and it's all, you know, very young.

1920
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,120
But, you know, I'm, you know, a grown man, but, you know,

1921
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,800
I'm a man child and therefore I am the target demographic.

1922
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,440
What if you had to pretend it was a child's drawing?

1923
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,480
You've had to like be like, oh yeah, my son made this.

1924
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,200
No, I didn't say anything, but I hope that they think

1925
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,160
that it's someone's son because I didn't draw it very well.

1926
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,200
I drew it very exactly, but like it's still like punk,

1927
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,160
which is a stick figure.

1928
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:07,960
Yeah.

1929
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,400
I drew it from the front and the side and they know what,

1930
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,040
what it looks like.

1931
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,600
It's adorable.

1932
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,520
The, I could, yeah, this, this seems like a service that more

1933
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,120
than just fucking people with shitty kids that can't draw

1934
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,320
would want to make you so.

1935
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,800
Also, the reason I trusted it in the first place to make the

1936
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,160
brisker plush is because, um, I think some of them are furries

1937
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,000
and they do like furry special things.

1938
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,240
Nice.

1939
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,680
Like if you have a furry OC.

1940
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,480
Never doubt the furries.

1941
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,080
If they, if they, they, if you have like a furry OC, you pay

1942
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,640
like more to get like a very, um, you know, bespoke plush made

1943
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,680
of your, your furry.

1944
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,320
You know, they, they, they lead with the kids stuff to

1945
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,160
hide the fact that 90% of their revenue is from furry OCs being created.

1946
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,720
Yep.

1947
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:47,960
Yep.

1948
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,120
So like they, they, they do quality work.

1949
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,080
I always see one.

1950
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:53,320
Yeah.

1951
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,840
For advanced specialty advanced commissions, for advanced drawings

1952
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,600
and OCs, specialty plush and faux furs, sneak peek and two

1953
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,640
rounds of changes.

1954
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,480
And I'm seeing this in the sample image.

1955
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,760
It sort of looks like the butter dragon from, uh, Undertale.

1956
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,160
Yep.

1957
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,880
But it's like green and it's covered in like stripes and it's got

1958
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,760
like a blue afro and shit.

1959
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,280
And these, these plushies, you know, they're quality because

1960
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,920
they need to be able to take extreme amounts of damage.

1961
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,000
Wear and tear from day to day use.

1962
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,720
If you know what I mean.

1963
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:17,880
Yeah.

1964
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,160
Tell you.

1965
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:19,880
I am.

1966
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,120
Yeah.

1967
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,080
Some of these sample images don't look like they were drawn by kids.

1968
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,320
Yeah.

1969
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,640
I am, I am tempted to make myself a mage plushie just because I want one.

1970
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:28,760
You should.

1971
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,560
Well, buying a single one is quite expensive.

1972
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,200
The risker was like 200 pounds or something.

1973
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,600
Yeah.

1974
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,080
All cold.

1975
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:35,960
Yeah, never mind.

1976
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,120
But it is the only, it is the only risker plush that exists.

1977
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,880
And it's the coolest thing that I own probably.

1978
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,640
How could that be considering the popularity of Homestack?

1979
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,280
That's just shocking.

1980
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,840
I mean, maybe people have made like homemade ones.

1981
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,520
Yeah, this is the highest quality one.

1982
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:48,840
Yeah.

1983
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,240
It's the coolest.

1984
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,880
But yeah, obviously mass production costs go dramatically lower.

1985
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,360
Let's do it.

1986
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,240
Let's say, wait a minute.

1987
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:57,720
Best of luck.

1988
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,160
Wait just a fucking second.

1989
01:11:59,160 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah.

1990
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,280
Okay.

1991
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,120
I'm seeing there's a sample, a sample image for something called selfies,

1992
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,360
which is a, a being of yourself.

1993
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,640
Oh yeah, that was so strange.

1994
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,040
It looks very strange, but the sample image.

1995
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,760
That's what I want.

1996
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,880
I can't tell, but it almost looks like it's two people cosplaying.

1997
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,360
The same, it's two people cosplaying at an anime convention.

1998
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,320
The guy's got a katana and the girl's in like a corset.

1999
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,080
I want a fucking high res image.

2000
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,880
I want to know what they're doing, but I can't, it's too small.

2001
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,520
I can't make it out.

2002
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,960
He's definitely got a katana though.

2003
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,800
His plus, he's got a floppy katana.

2004
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,760
It's like, it's like he's holding the handle at a 90 degree angle,

2005
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,920
but it's flopping down and pointing straight at the floor.

2006
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,720
He had a floppy katana.

2007
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,440
Fucking good.

2008
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:35,960
Looks like shit.

2009
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:36,920
But, you know.

2010
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,360
Well, good work guys.

2011
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:38,600
Yeah.

2012
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,760
The other one's pretty good though.

2013
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,160
Well, hey, with that, maybe we should do the voicemails.

2014
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:43,720
No.

2015
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,040
No?

2016
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:44,280
No.

2017
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,560
APS, APSadventures.site is where you can read my comic.

2018
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:52,440
We can't, we can't go to the voicemails because I have a bit to do.

2019
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,000
It's time.

2020
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,640
Oh.

2021
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,080
It's time everyone.

2022
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,320
For the new, the new thing.

2023
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,680
The new thing that we do on the, on the PCP.

2024
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,080
Fucking.

2025
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,360
It's time.

2026
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,560
There it is.

2027
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,040
Everything's so far away.

2028
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,960
Everyone's favorite shell.

2029
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,040
Thank you whoever made that.

2030
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,680
Anyone remember whose voicemail that was?

2031
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,160
I don't.

2032
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:24,200
All right.

2033
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,160
Okay.

2034
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,520
Let me, let me, this week's round of grievances with the pizza party podcast.

2035
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,080
Yeah.

2036
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,120
I'm very pissed.

2037
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,840
Oh, is that what this is?

2038
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,400
I still, I still haven't heard the podcast.

2039
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,040
Where's the, where's the podcast?

2040
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,600
I'm, I'm looking around.

2041
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,560
I'm looking all around 360.

2042
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,840
I don't see it.

2043
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,200
Where's the podcast?

2044
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,160
Can't find it.

2045
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:51,960
That's bad conveyance.

2046
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,800
That's a zero out of ten experience right there.

2047
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,120
I know where the PCP is.

2048
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,080
It's right here.

2049
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,920
It's where this voice that you're hearing right now, wherever it's emanating from.

2050
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,560
PCP right here, right now.

2051
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,400
In your face, visceral.

2052
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,160
PPP, nowhere.

2053
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,800
Nothing.

2054
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,600
A mere shade.

2055
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,480
In the toilet.

2056
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,680
A phantom.

2057
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,880
In the toilet.

2058
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,000
Not even real.

2059
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Second, what kind of pizza?

2060
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,600
Are we talking about a high quality wood-fired brick oven artisan pizza?

2061
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,080
It's almost certainly not.

2062
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,280
We're talking about some Papa John Little Caesars bullshit.

2063
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,520
I have no confidence in this brand.

2064
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,000
I have no idea what the nutritional value is.

2065
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,640
I have no idea what my value for money is going to be.

2066
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,640
I go into this, I go into this investment, this investment of time and money

2067
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,480
with no idea of what I'm going to receive and frankly I'm not comfortable with it

2068
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,040
in the, down the drain, in the toilet, pizza party podcast, get it together,

2069
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,560
or else you'll be featured on another segment next week.

2070
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,680
Oh, it's time to shit on the pizza party podcast.

2071
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,960
You're here.

2072
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,920
Bad campaign.

2073
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,640
Hooray.

2074
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:59,000
Ben, I have to question your ability to analytically read between the lines.

2075
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,400
I mean, why would there ever be a brick oven-fired pizza at a pizza party?

2076
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:08,440
You always go for the cheapest, most, you know, definitely go for Little Caesars

2077
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,800
if you're throwing a party because you're trying to feed as many people as possible.

2078
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,400
Maybe it's, maybe it's party is more of an intimate gathering.

2079
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,720
Maybe it's a political party.

2080
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,840
Maybe it's like, oh shit.

2081
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:24,920
It's like an old Italian gentleman gathering outside their bistro and someone brings out

2082
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:31,800
a piping hot pizza pie from the ovens and it's just a lovely, decadent, old world experience.

2083
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,240
Maybe that's the kind of party it is.

2084
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,720
All right, I've had it with pizza pie.

2085
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,840
I've had it with pizza pie.

2086
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,720
Why is it called a pie?

2087
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,760
A pie is tall.

2088
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,280
A pie is have a crust over it.

2089
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,920
Yeah, a pie, if anything, it's more of a tart because it has an open top.

2090
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,640
That's what I said to your mother last night.

2091
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,240
It's just more of a tart.

2092
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,080
Nate says to his brother, Ben St.

2093
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,360
So viewers, so viewers, if you, if you, if you've managed the Titanic task to find and

2094
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:07,160
identify the pizza, where the pizza party podcast is or what it is, let them know to

2095
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,840
get their act together or else Ben St. on the procrastinator podcast is gonna rip them a new one.

2096
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,880
Hit them with some hard hashtag, where's the podcast?

2097
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,240
Forever.

2098
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,480
Yeah.

2099
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:17,720
Yeah.

2100
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,200
Hashtag.

2101
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,160
Where's the podcast?

2102
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,920
This is gonna overshadow this.

2103
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,880
This where's a podcast?

2104
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,120
Hashtag is gonna overshadow my where to beef.

2105
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,720
Hashtag that I established yesterday.

2106
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,680
What's that relevant to?

2107
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,240
Where's the beef?

2108
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:33,480
Because because there's this this Netflix film.

2109
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,280
There's another like Chinese anime, except that it's entirely Japanese, except that it's Chinese.

2110
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,120
But it's it's basically a Makoto Shinkai movie, except in China.

2111
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:49,960
And the whole first part of this film, it's like 15 minutes of this guy talking about this dish

2112
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,960
that he refers to almost exclusively as beefu.

2113
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,680
He's always saying like, oh, that's the San Zhan beefu.

2114
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,000
And he keeps talking about like, oh, we would eat that beefu.

2115
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,600
And it was such good beefu.

2116
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,520
However, however, zero times does the word beef appear in the subtitles.

2117
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,240
So you're calling up the suburbs more than anybody else.

2118
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,240
It's the soy boy conspiracy.

2119
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,840
It was Netflix's subs.

2120
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,280
So they removed the beefu.

2121
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,320
Yeah, there's no beefu.

2122
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,440
They censored it.

2123
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,320
And he says beefu like literally 60 times.

2124
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,920
Now vegetarian activists.

2125
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,240
What did they say in the subtitles though?

2126
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,920
They were just I mean, because first of all, the dish they would call San Zhan noodles,

2127
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,240
which is like, I think that is another like name for the dish.

2128
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,520
But the thing is that when he's just talking about like eating it,

2129
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,240
he might say like, I would eat a big spoonful.

2130
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,840
But like, and that's how they would translate it.

2131
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,320
But like the way he actually says it in Japanese is like,

2132
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,240
I would eat a spoonful of that beef.

2133
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,920
You know, like he just kept insistently saying the word.

2134
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,320
Now someone told me it's possible because there is a Japanese word for noodles

2135
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,960
that is of some type that is beefu.

2136
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,120
But but but it didn't seem to be the case.

2137
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:07,160
I heard beefu over and over again, like literally 60 times in 15 minutes,

2138
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,840
not once in the subtitles.

2139
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,520
So so May and I made a whole we made a whole stink

2140
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,960
about the where to beefu conspiracy, the soy boy conspiracy.

2141
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,800
Excellent. Speaking of beefu, I went to, you know, during the meetup.

2142
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,240
You got a bit of a beefu with the PC, the pizza party podcast.

2143
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,840
Exactly. I certainly do.

2144
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,360
I think we found the beefu.

2145
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,520
But I went to remember for the meetup.

2146
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,160
We all went to the the dumpling cafe in Chinatown.

2147
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,440
After after Community Day, after Mama Swine or Swine Up Community Day,

2148
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,720
I mean, me and Kazi went to beef that that place.

2149
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,040
And I I have gotten some shit orders there.

2150
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,640
They will let you order everything.

2151
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,080
They will let you order like any fucking weird, like like garbage meat

2152
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,920
and like bizarre roughage that you don't know what it is thrown on a plate.

2153
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,160
Like when we were all there, I got some like clams on some like chopped,

2154
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,640
like I don't even know what the vegetable was.

2155
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,400
It was trash. I hated it.

2156
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,680
This time I stuck to something that I got beef and black pepper.

2157
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,680
I got beef with black pepper and it was so good.

2158
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,120
It was delightful. It was a true delight.

2159
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:12,840
It was spicy.

2160
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,760
Does anyone know when I was there did I think what I got and it was gross and terrible.

2161
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,680
I might be confusing with another Chinese place or whatever.

2162
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,040
But like I got it was like general so is like totally basic.

2163
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,720
When I bit into it, like the inside was like not cooked all the way.

2164
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,480
And it was pink and disgusting.

2165
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,360
And I hated it.

2166
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,280
I have I have gotten some I have gotten some real bad shit.

2167
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:37,720
Like one time I got like are we talking about that place that we all that we went?

2168
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,920
Yeah, with you know, I don't understand why you keep going there.

2169
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:50,600
If you've had bad experiences and it's literally surrounded on all sides by other Asian restaurants

2170
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,480
that you can go to instead. I have had bad experiences.

2171
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:57,800
I have had bad experiences, but I have also had very good experiences that have been very cheap

2172
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,920
for the money. All right.

2173
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,400
And that place was not cheap at all. That place.

2174
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,560
Yeah, it was. Well, I you can get like you can get like a good like like lunch there for like

2175
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,680
12. Have you been to enough Chinese places?

2176
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,480
Like it's not it's not cheap for what it is.

2177
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,640
No, but it's the devil.

2178
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:24,680
That's the problem. I see people do this where you you select a restaurant and then you go there.

2179
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,000
And if it's not shit, then you just keep going back, even though there's a chance

2180
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,400
even if it's right across the street is better in every way.

2181
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,600
And you just don't know because you don't even try one dish.

2182
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,840
That's true beyond out of this world.

2183
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,880
It was literally the first time I went there.

2184
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,360
I paid 12 bucks and I got like the like pork belly and cabbage and it was really good for the price.

2185
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:50,520
And I was like this place rules and I've never been able to let go of that association,

2186
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,760
even though I've had I've gotten some real trash.

2187
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:59,880
My methodology is when I move into a new place, I just try every single restaurant that is there.

2188
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,920
And then from there, now I know what are the top ones.

2189
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,120
And then I, you know, return to those continually from then on.

2190
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,400
Yes, it's sort of like me because we have we have a lot.

2191
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:17,080
We used to have a lot of takeaways and I would like to try out new restaurants and stuff.

2192
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,160
But we tried out a lot of restaurants until we settled on one that we really like.

2193
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,480
And we have a few backups in case that one's not available.

2194
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,200
That's the key.

2195
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,600
And I mean, the one that just it's funny to me because the one that Ben is talking about

2196
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:35,560
is in Chinatown and it's just like it just seems like any random Chinese restaurant

2197
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:43,000
in literally a sea of a lot of what you look way better like Asian restaurants that are just

2198
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,000
all around like every door on the road for like a mile is just Asian restaurants.

2199
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,440
It's like that feeling when you're with your boys and you I don't know, you're like out doing

2200
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,360
something and like you're on your way to the restaurant that you're going to as you walk

2201
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,440
by millions and millions of restaurants.

2202
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,880
But we got to get to that one.

2203
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,120
And you're just like, but what is why?

2204
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,240
Because I'm looking over there and that looks like a really hoppin delicious Thai restaurant.

2205
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,080
And this looks like a hole in the wall Chinese thing.

2206
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,000
So why are we going to this one?

2207
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,640
I don't know.

2208
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:18,120
Guys like me, when you've got a plan, I don't want to deviate from the plan.

2209
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,720
And I'll die before I do anything.

2210
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:24,920
That's not the plan gives me that feeling of comfort that I you're not wrong.

2211
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,440
Dude, there probably are.

2212
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:30,120
There probably I mean, there's yeah, there probably are better places.

2213
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,120
But there's like you say, there's so many and I'm not I can't check them all.

2214
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,680
Why not?

2215
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,240
Check them all.

2216
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,760
I mean, I mean, I'm not in town enough to do that.

2217
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:43,560
I guess if I'm in town, I will always go to a different place.

2218
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,720
Like you just as a matter of course.

2219
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,640
Now now maybe I want next time I'm in town.

2220
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,280
Maybe I want to be like, let me just see what else is around.

2221
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:55,080
I mean, to me, that's the point of living in a city is that there is so much variety

2222
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,520
that you don't have to go to the same shit that you've already been to all the time.

2223
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,680
You know, you go somewhere different every time because there's so much excitement,

2224
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,120
so much to explore and discover.

2225
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:09,240
So why would you ever go to the same place if there's another place you haven't been to yet?

2226
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:14,040
Once you've been everywhere, that's when you go, OK, well, I know the wheat from the chaff and

2227
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:15,720
I'm just going to go to the good place.

2228
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,000
I've thrashed my milk and separated the chaff out.

2229
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,560
Remember that?

2230
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,840
That was a classic moment on the last episode of the PCP.

2231
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:23,880
I wasn't there.

2232
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,000
Of course, of course.

2233
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,240
OK, all right, never mind.

2234
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,600
How about we get to those voicemails?

2235
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,320
I think it's time.

2236
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,840
I think it's time that we go do that.

2237
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,240
All right.

2238
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,480
OK, let's see.

2239
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,440
Everybody speak pipe.

2240
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,080
You know the deal.

2241
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,680
Give us your stuff.

2242
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,520
Click the link below.

2243
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,040
Send it to the speak pipe link.

2244
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,400
You know what I'm talking about.

2245
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,520
All right, let's get into it.

2246
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,880
First mail here.

2247
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,200
Let me get to the right place here.

2248
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,600
There we go.

2249
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,800
OK, this is from Rune Factory is Good.

2250
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,360
Yes.

2251
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,400
OK, go.

2252
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,440
What's up, PCP?

2253
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:58,200
I'm calling in because I can't take any more of Nate's wrong opinions.

2254
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,800
Now this started with his wrong opinions about the economy.

2255
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,240
It continued with his wrong opinions about food.

2256
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:11,160
But now I'm literally boiling with rage over his recent

2257
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,640
horrible affront to me.

2258
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,120
That Rune Factory 4 is a bad game that people shouldn't buy.

2259
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,280
He said this in the Nintendo Direct live stream.

2260
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,720
Yeah, that's where he's messing up.

2261
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,080
And frankly, I am fucking pissed.

2262
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,880
What problem did you possibly have with the game

2263
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:34,760
that takes farming the hard works of a person to improve themselves

2264
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,360
and gain social capital points and literal capital in the world

2265
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,000
by selling the fucking robbery.

2266
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,760
He's going to say like, oh my god, farming.

2267
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,360
Nate, it's like, sweat of your brown shit.

2268
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,160
Yeah, OK, I got it.

2269
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,720
This is literally self-saving.

2270
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,240
The combat is dog shit.

2271
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,480
And Rune Factory 4, I hated it.

2272
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,760
I labored through that game for a year.

2273
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,480
It was fine.

2274
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,080
I got my waifu.

2275
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,040
I played a bunch of Rune Factory 4 and I made it.

2276
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
The point of the game is that it is.

2277
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,160
I would almost compare it to like a clicker game

2278
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:09,320
because it's mostly just about making numbers go up in.

2279
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,080
Are you guys talking about Stardew Valley?

2280
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:11,640
No, no, no.

2281
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,920
It's very similar.

2282
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,080
A game about farming with dog shit combat.

2283
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,360
It's just about making numbers.

2284
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,200
We may as well be talking about Stardew Valley.

2285
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,360
They're both harvest Rune Clones.

2286
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,720
But the whole point of Rune Factory is that it's harvest Rune.

2287
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,920
Right, it's harvest Rune, but in a fantasy world

2288
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,000
and with swords and dungeons and stuff.

2289
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,440
Is harvest Rune in the real world?

2290
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,280
That's Stardew Valley.

2291
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,440
That's Stardew Valley is that exact description.

2292
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,680
But Rune Factory is a lot more combat driven.

2293
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,040
It's more anime-esque.

2294
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,960
And way more anime-esque.

2295
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,840
But is it 3D?

2296
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,600
But yeah, it is like pretty much.

2297
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,120
There's just like an endless amount of things you can do

2298
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,120
and only so much time in the day.

2299
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,920
So it's all about like managing what do I want to do

2300
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,280
with my time and constantly being on the grind.

2301
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,400
And like it's one of those things where the satisfaction

2302
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,440
is just in that literally no matter what you do

2303
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,720
as long as you're doing something

2304
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,960
you are making some kind of progress.

2305
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:09,080
So it's just that feeling of just constantly doing

2306
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,320
little things that are like, oh I'm getting better

2307
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,440
and my numbers are going up.

2308
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,760
Everything is better than it was a second ago.

2309
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,840
But like the actual what you do never gets more complicated

2310
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,240
as a player.

2311
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:19,960
With games like this.

2312
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,080
This isn't 3D.

2313
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,760
Well it's top down.

2314
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,280
The models are 3D.

2315
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,240
This is what I meant.

2316
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,200
But when I ask 3D I really just want to know if I can move up.

2317
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,240
Can you turn the camera?

2318
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,520
No, yeah, no you can't.

2319
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,160
You can't.

2320
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,840
Because that's what makes me enjoy things.

2321
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,640
With a game like Rune Factory or like I'm comparing it

2322
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,440
to the other games.

2323
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,040
It's what matters in this.

2324
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,320
Because there's so many competitors.

2325
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,560
It's like are the small gameplay tweaks tuned

2326
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,720
in the best way compared to the competition.

2327
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,520
And I definitely think that Stardew Valley

2328
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,960
is just like way more fun.

2329
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,120
There's more like customizability.

2330
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:57,080
When was Rune Factory 4 actually released the first time?

2331
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,240
God I don't know maybe like 2010 or something.

2332
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,280
Yeah it's pretty old.

2333
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,360
And I'll admit that the combat, a lot of it is clunky.

2334
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,360
But I really personally really like it.

2335
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,520
And I'm happy that it's coming to Switch.

2336
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,560
I don't have a switch yet.

2337
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,720
I want to talk about Stardew Valley.

2338
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,680
I want to talk, guys, I'm fucking torn.

2339
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,800
I'm fucking torn between Emily, Leah, and Abigail.

2340
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,880
I just, how am I supposed to choose?

2341
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,600
Abigail, she's purple.

2342
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,680
I like the purple barmaid hair I think.

2343
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,560
No, she's blue hair.

2344
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,200
She's blue hair.

2345
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,880
Yeah that was my first choice.

2346
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,800
But then I started to warm up to Leah

2347
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,160
and then later Abigail now.

2348
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,000
Like at first I was like cut and dry Emily.

2349
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,880
But then, but it's just gotten more complicated.

2350
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,960
Abigail, she's purple and she eats rocks.

2351
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,440
The romance triangle is just spiraling out of control.

2352
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,560
There's so many feelings.

2353
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,800
Oh, yeah, Abigail eats anything.

2354
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,720
Anything you get, it doesn't matter if you give her an answer.

2355
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,840
Well what a slut, am I right?

2356
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,320
How'd you know?

2357
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:47,800
How'd you know?

2358
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,440
I was hungry.

2359
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,720
This looks delicious.

2360
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,240
I recommend instead of Rune Factory playing Reciteer.

2361
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,120
I like, I love Reciteer.

2362
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,000
It's good.

2363
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,360
I played Reciteer.

2364
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,320
I got to the end game.

2365
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,520
It's not the same though.

2366
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,640
The end game, the end game seemed like a nightmare grind slog

2367
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,840
and I didn't want anything to do with it.

2368
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,680
So I just played through the main campaign

2369
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,400
and was happy with it.

2370
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,960
I think Stardew Valley is just the peak of this kind of game.

2371
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,800
Though, I mean Reciteer is basically a different one.

2372
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
Personally, I think it's not quite the same

2373
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,280
but it's pretty simple.

2374
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,680
I really dislike the aesthetic of Stardew Valley

2375
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,880
and also I think it's mega fucking boring.

2376
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,160
I don't care for it much.

2377
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,320
I don't, I don't understand that at all.

2378
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,120
I think it looks great.

2379
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,880
Yo, but the main, the quest loop.

2380
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,080
What the fuck?

2381
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,880
What the fuck?

2382
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,400
I just found out so much.

2383
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,920
And the girls aren't anime enough.

2384
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,080
The girls are way too western.

2385
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,360
They used to be more anime.

2386
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,360
I wish we could go back.

2387
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,520
There's old art of previous versions of the game.

2388
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,120
They were way more anime at certain points.

2389
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,880
I don't, wait, what don't you like about the aesthetic?

2390
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,840
This is totally bad.

2391
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,960
I really don't, first of all,

2392
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,360
I don't like how everything is weirdly tall.

2393
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,240
And secondly, I don't like the color design that much.

2394
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,680
For me, it's all about the character art.

2395
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,000
I don't, I think the people look ugly.

2396
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,800
You can download mods to change their portraits.

2397
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,000
What, on my Switch version?

2398
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,640
Can I do that?

2399
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,160
Which is where I have the game.

2400
01:28:59,240 --> 01:28:59,720
I mean.

2401
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,520
That's what I thought.

2402
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,320
Well, that's your mistake.

2403
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,440
I don't think that, I don't,

2404
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,560
I wouldn't praise the game and say,

2405
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,320
wow, it has such great character art or anything.

2406
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,920
I mean, I don't really care.

2407
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:09,880
I don't get it.

2408
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,880
When I'm trying to get that nut,

2409
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,200
Stardew Valley is not the game that I need.

2410
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,680
I mean, I don't care about the,

2411
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,040
I don't care about the portrait art.

2412
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,680
I don't care about that nut.

2413
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,880
It's better.

2414
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,600
Shut up.

2415
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,960
I don't care about the portrait art.

2416
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,560
I care about, like, look at, like,

2417
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,040
everything is such like nice, lush, like, sprite work.

2418
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,920
It's, it's gorgeous.

2419
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,920
The town is, the town is very attractive, I think.

2420
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,200
Mostly.

2421
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,560
So yeah, I like all that stuff.

2422
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,680
And, and, and the best thing about Stardew Valley,

2423
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,760
the most satisfying thing about the game

2424
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,120
is the long-term quest of fixing up the community center

2425
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,520
by achieving all those little individual goals

2426
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,240
is super satisfying.

2427
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,920
The game fucking blue-balled me

2428
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,080
for like almost an entire year now.

2429
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,320
I have been short on fixing the communities

2430
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,040
to all I need.

2431
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:50,440
Yeah.

2432
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,200
An apple and a pomegranate.

2433
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,360
Waiting for the, the season-specific products

2434
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,720
can't completely hamstring me.

2435
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,800
And it's just because I didn't buy it

2436
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,920
from the mystery merchant.

2437
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,640
Yeah, I think so.

2438
01:29:59,640 --> 01:29:59,800
That's true.

2439
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,480
I have been going to the traveling cart

2440
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,360
every, like, every Friday and Sunday

2441
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,480
and looking, hoping for,

2442
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,800
I remember one time I did see a pomegranate there

2443
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,560
but it was before I realized that, like,

2444
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,480
I needed that for the community center.

2445
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,520
So I fucked up.

2446
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,280
So I have been waiting, yeah, like,

2447
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,360
I planted, I planted a pomegranate tree

2448
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,280
and an apple tree but it was like right after,

2449
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,040
it was just too late that I could,

2450
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:20,920
it wasn't after the season,

2451
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,840
I planted it just into the season.

2452
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,280
So it did, the tree didn't mature

2453
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,800
until the season was already over.

2454
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,640
So I've just been waiting for the year to go by.

2455
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:30,680
To get one apple and one pomegranate.

2456
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:35,960
So, like, it's directly to the actual human year.

2457
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,040
No, but it is, it is, like, slower.

2458
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,680
Like, a season will last, like, 30 days.

2459
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,680
Each season is 28 days, yeah.

2460
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,000
So each season is more like a month, basically.

2461
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,440
And you could just make your guy, like,

2462
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,720
go to sleep, wake up, go to sleep,

2463
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,360
wake up, go to sleep.

2464
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,880
But you have to do that, like, 90 times

2465
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,000
to get back to the season.

2466
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,360
And you'll, like, ruin your-

2467
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,000
I'm waking up and realizing we're still

2468
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,360
reacting to the first voicemail.

2469
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,480
That's true.

2470
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,600
We should move it along.

2471
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,560
Let's move it along here.

2472
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,760
Okay, next one is from-

2473
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2474
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,360
Post in the comments.

2475
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,360
Should I go with Emily, Leah, or Abigail?

2476
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,600
These are your choices.

2477
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,800
Actually, go for Sebastian.

2478
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,160
He's your boy.

2479
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,600
I like Sebastian.

2480
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,400
Are you allowed to be gay?

2481
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,200
Yeah.

2482
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,480
If I were going for a guy,

2483
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,520
I would absolutely go for Sebastian.

2484
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,400
I knew you would.

2485
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,200
I knew you would.

2486
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,560
He's the edgy one.

2487
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,360
Okay, next one.

2488
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,160
Voice mail from Mackie's back.

2489
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:23,400
Go.

2490
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:29,960
Hey, so, PCP, recently, a good friend of mine

2491
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,320
admitted they had a crush on me,

2492
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,960
making me the first PCP fan with a girlfriend.

2493
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,960
Wow.

2494
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,640
But here's the issue.

2495
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,840
She lives in Florida.

2496
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,840
I live in Massachusetts.

2497
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:44,440
And neither of us have that much money.

2498
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:48,440
So, I know some of you have had weird internet

2499
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,640
relationships like this.

2500
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,400
Do you have any advice?

2501
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,880
Help?

2502
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,520
Don't do it.

2503
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,160
Give up.

2504
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,720
Give up.

2505
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,680
It's difficult.

2506
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,680
I mean, I would say you can cheaply

2507
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,440
take a train down there, right?

2508
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,360
Like, that's how Ben was visited, too.

2509
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,720
From Massachusetts, I mean, relatively cheaply.

2510
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,120
I used to, yeah, well, okay.

2511
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,160
When I used to go from Virginia to Georgia,

2512
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,520
it would take me like,

2513
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,760
it would only cost me maybe like 20 or 30 bucks

2514
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,640
for the whole trip.

2515
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,280
But it would take me like 16 hours.

2516
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,560
I mean, it's just a matter of how determined are you.

2517
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,040
Like, do you really like this girl or not?

2518
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,920
Like, yeah.

2519
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,480
Because I mean.

2520
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,200
Let's be real.

2521
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:28,680
Let's be real.

2522
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,200
This is like the first guy,

2523
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,960
the first girl who came to him said like,

2524
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,840
I like you.

2525
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,480
And so, of course, our boy is going to jump on it.

2526
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,920
But, you know, like, if you came up to him today,

2527
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,760
you lived in his town and said like,

2528
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,800
hey, I want to date you.

2529
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,960
Is he not going to drop this long distance girl

2530
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,680
like a sack of potatoes?

2531
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,400
No, of course.

2532
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,680
But here's the question.

2533
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,120
First of all, do you have any prospects

2534
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:55,720
IRL and if have you lost your virginity?

2535
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,040
If you have not lost your virginity

2536
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:01,880
and she is like DTF, take a fucking train,

2537
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,400
do it as cheaply as possible.

2538
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,720
Do not take a flight, take a train,

2539
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,000
take something cheap, keep it under 100 bucks,

2540
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:15,560
get down there, meet her, have sex and see how things go.

2541
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,480
And if it seems like you would like to eventually pursue this

2542
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,440
as a serious thing, then you need to be working on

2543
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,720
how can we get into the same place as soon as possible.

2544
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,400
If there is no recourse there, if the answer is

2545
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,200
we can't do that, shut this thing down.

2546
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,800
Because like, you don't want to be in an internet relationship

2547
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,800
for fucking who knows how long with no actual plan.

2548
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,720
And you should, if you got, if you got,

2549
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,240
okay, she's your girlfriend now.

2550
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,480
If I assume you guys want to fuck.

2551
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,760
So you and her should make that happen.

2552
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,400
You should like, you know, get money and buy a train and buses.

2553
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,160
And you can do it for not that much.

2554
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,360
You can, if you look around,

2555
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,880
you can probably find ways to do it.

2556
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,880
I'll bet you could get from Massachusetts to Florida

2557
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,200
for under, definitely under 100 bucks.

2558
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,240
Maybe under 50 if you were really resourceful.

2559
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,880
It will probably take you like a day or more.

2560
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,000
But whatever, yeah.

2561
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,880
If you want to, I don't know, I mean, I don't think,

2562
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,760
I don't think it matters if you've lost your virginity or not.

2563
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,960
If you want to fuck and you want to spend a day

2564
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,920
or ends a little bit of money to make that happen, then do that.

2565
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,280
Maybe get her to contribute because she's, you know,

2566
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,640
part of this endeavor as well.

2567
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,160
I just think that the most important thing more so than even going down there

2568
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,200
is that like, if you do this, you have to know that like,

2569
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,800
there's two ways that it can happen.

2570
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,960
Either you'll go down and you'll, you'll,

2571
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:41,160
you'll realize that you don't want this to be a long-term relationship

2572
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,120
or you guys will super like each other and super click.

2573
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,320
And then immediately the question is going to have to be,

2574
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,520
how can we make this no longer long-distance?

2575
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,880
Because long-distance relationships are suffering.

2576
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:58,120
You will not be able to easily have sex again.

2577
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,440
You won't be able to easily spend time together.

2578
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,080
You won't be able to have that, you know, that,

2579
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,600
that emotional support.

2580
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,480
That is what you're really coming to a relationship for more so.

2581
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,960
The end goal, the end goal of a long-distance relationship

2582
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,920
needs to be to not be a long-distance relationship.

2583
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:18,760
Otherwise it is a, it is a waste and you will be sorry.

2584
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,080
It is a waste. It definitely is a waste.

2585
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,280
And yeah, just don't, and don't put yourself in the position.

2586
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,360
Well, hey, don't put yourself in the position where

2587
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,200
you've got this long-distance girlfriend and you're like,

2588
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,240
well, I've got no other prospects because it will make you weak

2589
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,640
and it will make you just waste your time being like,

2590
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,200
well, I've got a girlfriend so I'm all good, but no.

2591
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:36,760
Yeah. No.

2592
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:40,760
The other side of the coin though is that if you meet up, say,

2593
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,240
and you get to know, you know, this relationship progresses

2594
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,600
and you find yourself feeling like I'm not that interested

2595
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,280
in progressing this and making this a not long-distance relationship,

2596
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,760
then you know, quit. Don't do it.

2597
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,640
Yeah. Give up.

2598
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,280
And that's fine.

2599
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,120
It's way easier to make those kind of decisions

2600
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,800
when you've met the person in person.

2601
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,960
Just it's a lot easier to sort out.

2602
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,480
I think there's a problem or something.

2603
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,200
You never really know the person until you have to live with them.

2604
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:05,720
Yeah.

2605
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,720
That's also true, but I think you can get a,

2606
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,600
you'll know a lot more than you do just by talking online if you meet them.

2607
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2608
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:15,960
And I don't know.

2609
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,160
I don't know how much talk.

2610
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,440
I don't know if you guys are like,

2611
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,920
Skyping all the time and stuff like, you know,

2612
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,120
does that just suck though?

2613
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,320
I hate doing that.

2614
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,600
It really sucks.

2615
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,080
And like, I, so I don't know what I don't know,

2616
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,800
like what level it's on where like, I don't know,

2617
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,160
you know, how much you guys know about each other or how close you are.

2618
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,960
But like, you definitely have to meet somebody in person

2619
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,160
to get a better sense of what they're like than what you're going to get.

2620
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,560
I mean, you know, you're only talking to each other

2621
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:46,680
in like a manufactured scenario of like having to sit in front of a camera

2622
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,680
and talk to a person directly,

2623
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,560
as opposed to just like being around each other

2624
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,720
and knowing what their mannerisms are like

2625
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,320
and how they generally like the cadence of their living, you know,

2626
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,400
which is much more important.

2627
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,200
So feel it out dog.

2628
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,960
So best of luck.

2629
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,800
Don't don't settle for a shitty relationship

2630
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,160
as opposed to no relationship.

2631
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,440
Because sometimes none is better

2632
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,280
because then you can just find one that is better.

2633
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,480
So there you go.

2634
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,400
It probably sounds like this probably just be a big waste of time.

2635
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,240
Sorry, sorry to burst your bubble.

2636
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,000
You know what, maybe this guy is like 15,

2637
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,520
this is like the first person who's ever,

2638
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,960
and like, great, fantastic.

2639
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,880
Have a good time, you know, feel it out.

2640
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,120
Sure.

2641
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:25,960
Do what you gotta do.

2642
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,880
But don't trap yourself somewhere.

2643
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,080
And then they're going to be like,

2644
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,120
Oh, but don't you love me?

2645
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,960
If you love me, you date me no matter where I was from.

2646
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:32,920
I don't love you, bitch.

2647
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:33,960
I don't love you.

2648
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,080
Just say that to her.

2649
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,280
And then execute her.

2650
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,720
Curve Stop.

2651
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,960
Okay, next voicemail on that note.

2652
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:44,040
Hell yeah.

2653
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,200
Hell yeah, meaghtow for life.

2654
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:50,040
This is fromrupt and it's coded as super important.

2655
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,720
So let's see what that's about.

2656
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,440
Do the flu, where the fuck are you?

2657
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,960
The flu, do are you?

2658
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:04,680
Please, the flu, where the fuck are you?

2659
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,840
You are the fucking guy.

2660
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,640
I don't fucking care about no one but Davoo.

2661
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,640
What the fuck?

2662
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,080
Uh, there's the voice of the people.

2663
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,960
They clamor for Davoo.

2664
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,000
Davoo messaged me on Discord a while ago.

2665
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,240
And I was like, hey, wow, a message from Davoo.

2666
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:19,560
Cool.

2667
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,200
I should really read that and get back to him.

2668
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,400
And then I forgot to do that.

2669
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,760
So sorry, sorry, Davoo.

2670
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,480
He sent us a secret friend's only video.

2671
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,720
I won't even spill the beans.

2672
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,320
Did you guys get sent this as well?

2673
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,280
Wait, this was it.

2674
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,040
And I forgot to actually watch it.

2675
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,640
I responded with an exact quote,

2676
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,080
hey, hey, hey, dope.

2677
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,120
And I stand by it.

2678
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,480
I stand by that message.

2679
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,440
I won't even say what it is, but it is hilarious.

2680
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,520
I'm a bad person.

2681
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,240
Agreed.

2682
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:47,480
Okay.

2683
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,160
Yeah, yeah.

2684
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:53,480
Davoo has just been, you know, offline for a while.

2685
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,360
Yep.

2686
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,920
But like, I don't know, he'll come back when he wants to.

2687
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,920
I hope he's working on another game.

2688
01:38:58,920 --> 01:38:59,560
Yeah, me too.

2689
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,760
Or I don't know, like preparing his.

2690
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,680
Autominus was like a surprise hit.

2691
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,760
Release Autonomous on Switch, Davoo.

2692
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,640
Do it now.

2693
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,000
Do it immediately.

2694
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,120
I'd fucking buy Autonomous for Switch just to support him.

2695
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,720
Autominus is fucking sick.

2696
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,960
I mean, I'd play five bucks any day.

2697
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,720
He's not going to get it on Switch.

2698
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,280
What are you talking about?

2699
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:16,760
Whatever.

2700
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,640
Get it on Steam then.

2701
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,440
They'll take anything.

2702
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,040
They'll take whatever garbage they can.

2703
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,560
He could, he could get it on Steam.

2704
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,240
I thought it was funny as hell.

2705
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,360
Well, I don't know what the process is like,

2706
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,120
but it's good enough to be on Steam.

2707
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:26,680
Absolutely.

2708
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:27,000
Absolutely.

2709
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:27,960
By a huge margin.

2710
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,440
Yeah.

2711
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:28,680
Okay.

2712
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,040
Well, anyway, they'll take any old fucking shit visual novel.

2713
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,760
That's true.

2714
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,320
That's true.

2715
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:34,680
All right.

2716
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,320
Next one.

2717
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,560
This is from A2Z.

2718
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:37,800
Go.

2719
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,200
Okay, Nate.

2720
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,720
I know you're listening to this.

2721
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:41,960
Yeah.

2722
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,480
You don't have to put this on the show,

2723
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:49,400
but please read the official one piece release on shonenjump.com

2724
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,760
or vis slash shonenjump, whatever.

2725
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:57,240
It's good quality, better quality than the scanlations.

2726
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,040
That's enough.

2727
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:58,680
Yeah, I know.

2728
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,560
I got the gist.

2729
01:39:59,560 --> 01:39:59,880
Okay.

2730
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,000
Cut that off, edit man.

2731
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,600
He's just, this guy wrote in, and I appreciate that,

2732
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,520
to just let me know that they release one piece chapters,

2733
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,440
like weekly, relatively, on the actual Viz Media site.

2734
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,600
After hearing this, I went and read it,

2735
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,440
and it does look quite good.

2736
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,760
The problem is, however, they take,

2737
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,320
like the new chapter has been out for several days,

2738
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,120
and they have not released it on the website yet.

2739
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,160
So you'd be fucking hamstrung if you were depending on this

2740
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,400
for doing like the pod decast or anything.

2741
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,160
So, you know, I'd probably go and read it like later,

2742
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,320
but not going to fucking do it up front.

2743
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,600
But this is an advertisement for people

2744
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,560
who want to read the highest quality releases of one piece.

2745
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,000
We don't need to advertise that shit.

2746
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,560
Give us the next one.

2747
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:41,720
No?

2748
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,680
Do you think everybody knows?

2749
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,280
I just wanted to give everybody like notice,

2750
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,320
because I wasn't even paying attention to this.

2751
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,280
No, I just meant I don't want to give free advertising to Viz.

2752
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,960
It's worth mentioning, I guess.

2753
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,800
Do you not like Viz, or they're like a bad company or something?

2754
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,240
No, I just don't, I don't know.

2755
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,200
It's just, it's just, I was just joking.

2756
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:56,680
All right.

2757
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,960
Did she just want to give it away for free?

2758
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:00,760
You gotta pay us.

2759
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,440
They certainly, they say it should pay us.

2760
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:02,760
You're right.

2761
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,160
That's what I'm saying.

2762
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:03,560
Okay, that's fair.

2763
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,760
I hear you.

2764
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:05,240
I hear you.

2765
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,360
Viz, call me up.

2766
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,200
I demand Viz, if you want us to sponsor your product,

2767
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,520
you call in and leave an epic voicemail

2768
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,080
that we could respond to on the episode.

2769
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,880
Fill it with memes and whatnot.

2770
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,320
Okay, moving on, whatever.

2771
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,560
Next one from Harlock Asnable.

2772
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:23,160
Fan favorite, go.

2773
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:27,480
So you know how last time I was on here,

2774
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,280
I was saying some stuff about Jesus and all that?

2775
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,840
Yeah, it was all bullshit.

2776
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:33,480
I lied.

2777
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,520
I'm sorry, I had to.

2778
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:39,480
But anyway, I can't really handle like real reality.

2779
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,960
So I've been shopping around for like a new religion,

2780
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,760
looked into Scientology, but it seems too expensive.

2781
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,960
And they also had a similar anti-gay agenda,

2782
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,560
just like a lot of the other ones.

2783
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,360
So what are some like niche religions,

2784
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,960
some like sweet like hidden gem religions?

2785
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,520
What are your best recommendations?

2786
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:02,360
What's your like artsy fartsy three by three of religions?

2787
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:02,920
I need to know.

2788
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,640
The Church of Spirit Science.

2789
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,120
Spirit Science is like buddies with Satan, I think.

2790
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,760
Seriously, Satan's like, you think it's the devil worship?

2791
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,520
No, it's like the worship of yourself.

2792
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,960
Yeah, but they put a really edgy label on it though.

2793
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,600
Yeah, exactly.

2794
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,080
You pissed off the Church people.

2795
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,000
I think that's unironically, literally,

2796
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,360
what the mindset behind Call of Duty was.

2797
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,160
It totally was.

2798
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:27,640
It was.

2799
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:33,080
Listen, Satanism doesn't let you pilot the fucking love

2800
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,600
battleship through the cosmos.

2801
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:36,920
Yeah, that's true.

2802
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,400
That's true.

2803
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,400
Satan never fucking aligned my Kundalini.

2804
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:42,840
Whoa.

2805
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:46,760
Whoa, the Catholic priests were aligning my Kundalini,

2806
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,000
my whole childhood, if you know what I'm saying.

2807
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,880
Hell yeah, dude.

2808
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:50,520
Hell yeah.

2809
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,040
Wait, what?

2810
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:52,600
Don't worry.

2811
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,800
All right, next call.

2812
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:57,000
This is from Schmeeblebop Dingle Dangle.

2813
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:57,960
Go.

2814
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:02,600
Hey, the BCP.

2815
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:03,560
Hello.

2816
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,600
That's my name.

2817
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,680
I have one serious question I seriously need to ask you guys.

2818
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,360
Okay.

2819
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:14,040
Why the fuck is my PB hard?

2820
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:19,640
Because you're listening to the pro-crastinators podcast,

2821
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,680
giving you a boner every single time.

2822
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,640
Yeah, there it is.

2823
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:24,520
Okay, that's all.

2824
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:26,040
Thanks for that.

2825
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,080
Don't make promises you can't deliver though.

2826
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,160
You left a really hard at that.

2827
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,040
Oh, we've delivered.

2828
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,840
All right, next one.

2829
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,280
We have a boner guarantee.

2830
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,040
If you're not satisfied with your boner,

2831
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,800
and for at least four hours after five times.

2832
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,760
We will come to your house and guarantee satisfaction personally.

2833
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,560
Voice mail number seven.

2834
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,400
We will RP with you on Discord, slide into our DMs,

2835
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,440
and make a complaint.

2836
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,560
You will achieve release, my dude.

2837
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,040
You will.

2838
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:56,920
I'm gonna throw up.

2839
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,280
All right, number seven.

2840
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,920
This is Cloud Strife calling in with another message.

2841
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,280
What do you have for us?

2842
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,560
Hello, it is me again, Cloud Strife.

2843
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,000
No piano this time.

2844
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:16,520
But Final Fantasy IX is out on the Nintendo Switch right now.

2845
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:18,440
And I was wondering,

2846
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,960
is it a good game?

2847
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,400
I have seven, and it's the best one.

2848
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,160
I've never finished nine.

2849
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,920
It's the best thing ever,

2850
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:31,240
but nine seems to have no Cloud Strife in it.

2851
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:35,160
So when did that automatically make it like a piece of trash game?

2852
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,800
As a matter of fact, in Lindblum,

2853
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,480
in the town in Final Fantasy IX,

2854
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:45,960
there is a weapon shop that on the wall has the Buster Sword

2855
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,760
that Zidane goes up and he talks to it.

2856
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,720
And it's just something like,

2857
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,480
it's something like, oh, I bet some stormy guys

2858
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,480
would sure enjoy using weapons like this.

2859
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:57,880
It's something like that.

2860
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,760
Roll my fucking eyes as hard as fucking possible.

2861
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,680
That's not exactly how it sounds.

2862
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,280
It's more clear or something,

2863
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,960
but it's something like, wow,

2864
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,440
who would be able to use a weapon this big or something like that?

2865
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,040
But it is the Buster Sword.

2866
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,080
Stormy guy.

2867
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,120
I gotta look up the quote.

2868
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,320
Okay, okay.

2869
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:16,120
Anyway, so anyway, Final Fantasy IX is a masterpiece.

2870
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,640
I got it for my switch,

2871
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:21,160
and man, I just wanted to give my quick review of the hour I played.

2872
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,280
Yep, that's bass as hell.

2873
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,400
The fucking, they definitely use that mobile port version

2874
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,360
or whatever, or the whatever steam version,

2875
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,600
that like, oh my God, the models of your characters

2876
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,520
and all the characters, they look good.

2877
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,600
The background art is muddled and god-awful and it is such.

2878
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,400
Oh, they didn't fix that?

2879
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,280
No, they can't.

2880
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,720
They've lost the original assets.

2881
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,160
This is all they've got.

2882
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:47,960
I will say that it's not so bad if you play it in windowed mode.

2883
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,080
Great.

2884
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,240
Great.

2885
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,280
Yeah, like if you could just thrash the resolution, then yeah.

2886
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,280
This is not the Buster Sword.

2887
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:56,600
No?

2888
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,320
Does it look similar?

2889
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,120
But like, I can't find the show notes.

2890
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,880
Not particularly.

2891
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:02,120
Okay.

2892
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,240
Link that, link that.

2893
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:04,760
Let me look at it.

2894
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,320
It's deaf.

2895
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,960
People think, okay, maybe I was exaggerating a little bit.

2896
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,440
Whatever, it's close enough.

2897
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:13,000
Apparently he says something that is sort of a reference

2898
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,640
to the size of Cloud's sword, but these are not Buster Sword.

2899
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,200
Okay, you know what?

2900
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,360
I was wrong, but there definitely was a reference there.

2901
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,440
Okay, but whatever, doesn't matter.

2902
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,080
Next voice mail.

2903
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:21,960
Point is, it's a great game.

2904
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,520
So go play it.

2905
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:23,080
How many of these do you have?

2906
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,440
Anyway, next voice mail.

2907
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,120
This is from, I'm Being Dead Serious.

2908
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:29,400
Begin.

2909
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:39,960
Kingdom Hearts 3, Fur Fags, Pokemon Go, Babies, Pokemon Let's Go,

2910
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,800
Actual Babies.

2911
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,200
Now you guys need to get your fucking big boy pants on.

2912
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:47,000
Go to the Google Play Store and download what Garfield Go.

2913
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,120
I'm fucking serious.

2914
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,840
Oh, you just got a French, Mr. Mine.

2915
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,240
Guess what?

2916
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:55,240
I was walking my dog yesterday and I found a fucking spicy Italian lasagna

2917
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,200
under a fucking tree.

2918
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,400
Oh, you just leveled up your Scyther into a scissor after grinding for months?

2919
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,040
I just gave my cat a fucking doughnut and he leveled up.

2920
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,440
Jesus Christ, get on my level.

2921
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:10,040
Every day you're not playing Garfield Go is like a fucking Monday.

2922
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,400
Fuck, man.

2923
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,480
It's real though.

2924
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,800
Garfield Go is a real game you can get.

2925
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,520
No, it's not.

2926
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:22,760
It is.

2927
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:23,800
I looked it up ahead of time.

2928
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:24,440
Shut the fuck up.

2929
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:25,080
It's real.

2930
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:25,640
We should all get it.

2931
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,400
Shut your fucking mouth.

2932
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:31,240
Go back to the fucking pizza party project with that fucking liar.

2933
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,440
No, we should.

2934
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,400
Next rad con.

2935
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,400
We have to go play Garfield Go.

2936
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,160
I just want to say I checked my shelf.

2937
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:45,000
I do have Final Fantasy IX on the PlayStation 1, so I can see it.

2938
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,120
Oh, you'll see it looking good.

2939
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,400
But the thing is though, the problem is that they're using, I think,

2940
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:52,040
the same visuals from the background of Final Fantasy IX,

2941
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,960
but because resolution has improved so much,

2942
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,560
they're able to render the models at a much higher resolution,

2943
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,760
but the background art is pre-rendered art and stuff.

2944
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,560
Oh yeah, yeah, I've seen that.

2945
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:07,480
It's not even that the new version looks worse than the old game.

2946
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:11,320
It's just weird and charring.

2947
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,280
I just think it's bad.

2948
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,360
They just don't look like they belong in the world.

2949
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,080
I can bear it.

2950
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,360
I can look past it.

2951
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,000
But it is.

2952
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,920
I got over it surprisingly quick.

2953
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:23,400
I had been avoiding buying that remake for years because of that,

2954
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,560
because the screenshots looked so fucking terrible,

2955
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,680
but when I was actually playing it, I was not that bothered by it.

2956
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,920
In the moment, from screen to screen, I can get over it,

2957
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,480
but whenever I stop and concentrate, I'm like, oof, yikes.

2958
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:37,960
I looked it up, and the line that Zidane says when he sees the sword is,

2959
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,680
I knew it.

2960
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,520
We used to call him Zidane, but it's actually Zidane.

2961
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,040
It looks like whatever.

2962
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,520
He says, I knew a spiky-haired guy that used a sword like this.

2963
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,320
That's the one.

2964
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,040
That's the one.

2965
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,080
I appreciate that.

2966
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:49,880
Stormy guy.

2967
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,000
Whatever, close enough.

2968
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,960
Okay, so Garfield Go, right?

2969
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,800
For 602 reviews on the Google Play Store.

2970
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,480
All five-star, I'm sure.

2971
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,480
Its overall rating is 4.1.

2972
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:01,800
Not bad.

2973
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:06,600
Let me, okay, JB says, it's working now.

2974
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:10,120
Get a kick out of Garfield pointing at the chests when you find them.

2975
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,200
If I win Sutton, I'll get it a level.

2976
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,120
I'll give it a five, no doubt.

2977
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:17,720
Great.

2978
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,200
Hold on.

2979
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:18,840
Nate, how's that?

2980
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,440
This golden voice feels as though we have left.

2981
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,320
I got to piss with it.

2982
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,680
We got two more after this.

2983
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,320
Wait, one more from a Google, from a Google use, wait, two more.

2984
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:32,360
Sebastian Foy says, I won a glazed donut from the 7-Eleven from the app.

2985
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:36,120
When redeeming the prize, be aware that the redeem button does not instantly give you a coupon.

2986
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,880
The redeem button sends you an email within three days,

2987
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,880
then you confirm your name and alien address, then they send you the prize.

2988
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,400
So you get real donuts out of this app.

2989
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,880
You can win like food from 7-Eleven.

2990
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,320
Holy shit.

2991
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:49,720
Okay, a Google user says, came for the memes and stuck around when it was actually fun.

2992
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,200
I didn't expect the prizes to actually be winnable,

2993
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:56,120
but I have a dozen Rad Garfield stickers on display in my kitchen now.

2994
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,080
Not bad.

2995
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,400
Pokemon Go ain't got me shit for stickers or donuts.

2996
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,360
One more, one more.

2997
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:07,880
Dr. Robonto TV Productions Films gives it five out of five stars and says,

2998
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,000
this game literally saved my life.

2999
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:17,560
He was starving to death and he needed that glazed donut.

3000
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:23,240
Garfield Go is the actual pinnacle of human achievement and should only be spoken if

3001
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,520
positively if you're a fan of angelic experiences.

3002
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,600
Download this masterpiece today.

3003
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,560
He's memanous.

3004
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,600
All right, that's pretty incredible.

3005
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,640
Okay, all right.

3006
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:33,880
Next.

3007
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:35,720
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3008
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,200
I've got it.

3009
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:36,680
I've got it.

3010
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:37,240
You downloaded it.

3011
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:37,720
You got it.

3012
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,440
We should all play.

3013
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,320
We should all play.

3014
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,000
Maybe it's Garfield Community Day today.

3015
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:44,600
Oh, every, wait, I was going to say every Monday is community day, but it's like anti-community

3016
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:44,680
day.

3017
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,920
You like lose money if you log in on a Monday.

3018
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:52,280
I want to announce that I did go out for swine of day and I did attain many delicious swine.

3019
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,480
I didn't name any of them Brunswick.

3020
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,440
Brunswick's dead, Nate.

3021
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:54,920
Too obvious, too obvious.

3022
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:55,800
You have to let go.

3023
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,600
You have to let go.

3024
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,000
He's gone.

3025
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:57,560
Okay.

3026
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:03,080
However, I do have the lucky Mamo swine that Munchie traded me when it was just a pillow swine.

3027
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:06,600
And its name is Beef and Barley in his reference.

3028
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,680
What's a shiny guy look like?

3029
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,640
Is he is like blue?

3030
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:10,920
It's kind of brownish green.

3031
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,880
It's not good.

3032
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,400
It's not a great shiny.

3033
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:13,640
Okay.

3034
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,520
Let's move on.

3035
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,280
We got actually there was three more total.

3036
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,400
This is prune man.

3037
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,120
Prune man.

3038
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:18,680
Hit us.

3039
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,480
Go.

3040
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,480
Hey Nathan slash Nathaniel.

3041
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:27,640
I can't believe that the fucking supposed best guy ever doesn't even know that the optimal food to

3042
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:32,360
make you poop is fucking prunes or prune juice even.

3043
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:37,880
It fucking gets that shit flowing right the fuck out and you're fucking sitting in the hospital

3044
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:38,920
paying fucking.

3045
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,560
I don't know.

3046
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:44,040
You don't even need to just so you can feel like oh I'm safe.

3047
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,320
I'm protected.

3048
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:50,440
Meanwhile, there's a perfect home remedy that's been there your whole life if not longer

3049
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,280
and prunes are even fucking good.

3050
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,800
They taste good.

3051
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,320
So just eat them.

3052
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:57,080
God damn it.

3053
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:00,680
I took I took actual laxatives and it wasn't doing shit.

3054
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,480
So I have never eaten a prune in my entire life.

3055
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,520
I've had some prunes.

3056
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,000
I like them.

3057
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,640
They're good.

3058
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,240
I think they're actually quite tasty.

3059
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,360
Prunes are nice.

3060
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:09,160
I like them too.

3061
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:10,680
I'm curious about them.

3062
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,360
I get a jar of dried prunes.

3063
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,480
They're kind of like apricots.

3064
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:13,960
They're real good.

3065
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,040
Sadly, they're not keto.

3066
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,400
Oh well.

3067
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:18,600
Tell them.

3068
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,400
Yeah.

3069
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:19,800
Fucked.

3070
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,160
There's some nice what's that?

3071
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:21,400
What's that?

3072
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,000
You know those people who makes the raisins with the lady with like the sunburst behind her?

3073
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,360
You know what I'm talking about?

3074
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,480
Oh yeah.

3075
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:27,960
Sunburst.

3076
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,760
No, minute made.

3077
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,200
No, minute made.

3078
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,320
Minute made.

3079
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:36,760
Okay, whatever it was they make like a big like cardboard tub of dried prunes and I would

3080
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,120
fucking snack on those all day.

3081
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,680
Mom used to get them.

3082
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,960
They were delicious as hell.

3083
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,600
Recommended.

3084
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,240
Recommended.

3085
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:43,960
Okay, but anyway, I should fucking just go buy some of those right now.

3086
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,480
Okay, next mail.

3087
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:45,960
Two more.

3088
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,880
This is from coolmichill.

3089
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,160
Commence.

3090
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:49,720
Sunmate.

3091
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:50,680
It's sunmate raisin.

3092
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,000
Sunmate, okay.

3093
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:53,800
Hey members of the PCP.

3094
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,600
I was just wondering how do all of you relax?

3095
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:00,920
Now this is largely geared towards like hippo or digi or nate.

3096
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:07,240
People who do review channels because I've noticed recently that even though I enjoy video games,

3097
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:11,400
I've started being hypercritical of them and trying to unpack them, etc.

3098
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,200
Figure out why I feel the way I do towards all of them.

3099
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,120
Take an analytical mindset.

3100
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:21,160
And this has led to me being just stressed all the time because I no longer have an outlet

3101
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,640
to just wind down what I want to.

3102
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,480
That's even if you play a good game.

3103
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:30,520
I guess you're saying he's turned on his analysis meter so high that it's given him

3104
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,720
the shakes and the shimmies.

3105
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,240
This is a place where it's difficult for me to relate to a lot of people because I

3106
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,840
I hear people say things like that or that they they're stressed out by like negativity.

3107
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:44,920
And I get like people tell me all the time like that they wish I would have like less

3108
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,680
negative takes on things.

3109
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:53,000
I don't find like to me it's fun to be negative to be analytical.

3110
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Like it's just my natural state.

3111
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It doesn't make me necessarily like I mean granted.

3112
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:03,320
There's lots of shows that like or games that I will just stop playing very quickly

3113
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:08,200
because they are you know because I'm analyzing and I think it's bad and I don't want to play

3114
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:08,760
it anymore.

3115
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:15,320
But like I don't I don't find the state of I guess because I don't force myself to

3116
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,240
continue playing those things if they're bad.

3117
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,760
Like I will just switch to something else.

3118
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:23,640
And to me the fun is in constantly burning through as many things as possible looking

3119
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:28,840
for something good and then you know getting to experience something really great because

3120
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:34,520
I didn't stop myself to you know play every fucking bad game or watch every bad show.

3121
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,880
Instead I just burned through all those until I found something truly amazing.

3122
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,960
And then yeah if you want to relax you just play the amazing game.

3123
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:45,560
I mean I'm sure Hippo could talk about playing Dark Souls over and over and over again.

3124
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:49,880
That was like yeah that's like me getting Final Fantasy 9 just because like I know it's great

3125
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:53,800
and I don't really have to think about much and just kind of nice just relax and you know

3126
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:54,280
play through it.

3127
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:02,280
This is a thing that I've kind of thought about a bit at some points like why how analysis as

3128
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:05,240
like a thing has like changed my views a little bit.

3129
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:11,800
Most obviously to me is like the way that I used to read One Piece where I wouldn't I

3130
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,800
didn't think anything could be bad about One Piece because I just enjoyed it the whole time.

3131
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:21,480
And then I met Nate and he talked about One Piece and he's you know he introduced me to

3132
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:30,280
being angry at it all the time and I was like I know it's but it's like you have criticisms

3133
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:36,360
and I never used to have them and now that I read One Piece there was a bit of a time when I was

3134
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:42,040
like what worrying like oh am I gonna be a nitpicky bitch not even that you are that but

3135
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:49,160
like I was wondering about it and I found that it's it's really just I don't care like like you

3136
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:53,800
can make yourself not care about things you can make yourself just be cool with anything yeah

3137
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:59,720
you know what I think like the the reason I liked analysis in the first place was just to

3138
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:05,240
understand why I like what I like so that I can explain it to people it's not necessarily about

3139
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:09,640
like tearing things down for the sake of it if you if you like analysis because you watch a lot

3140
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:16,920
of YouTube that does that and now you do it yourself um I guess just think about like why

3141
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:23,640
like do you do you want to be like the youtubers you're watching or is it something like do you

3142
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:28,360
actually want to do it yourself I think that a big part of the entertainment value of media for me

3143
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:35,320
is getting to have an opinion on it like that is what I'm like coming to it for is like I'm gonna

3144
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:41,480
watch this and I'm gonna have an opinion and it's gonna be great you know and then like if it's bad

3145
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:46,440
I can go aw man I can explain why this is bad that's gonna be a lot of fun or if it's great

3146
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:51,400
oh I can't wait to brag about how great this show is and tell everybody to go watch it it's like

3147
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:55,480
I can't lie that now that I do YouTube stuff when I see something and I like have something I think

3148
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:59,720
is really interesting to say that's very exciting that I'm gonna get to share like with people and

3149
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:05,720
I'm like hell yes and that's why it frustrates me when there are people who are like oh I you know

3150
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:11,080
I find your your negativity depressing or something I'm like you if you're finding it depressing

3151
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:15,880
you shouldn't be watching these videos because I'm finding it fun I'm doing this because it's

3152
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:22,040
exciting and it's it's like I get to look at something and I get to explain why I feel a

3153
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:26,360
way about a thing and that's always fun it doesn't matter if it's negative or positive feelings

3154
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:31,720
you know and you know I I just realized I didn't really answer his question like how to relax

3155
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:40,280
none of us have it's um I I mean I there was a time when I was like I wouldn't play a game

3156
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:44,440
unless I wanted to make a video on it or unless I thought I could make a video on it now I don't

3157
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:49,320
really do the video stuff anymore so it's easier to just pick up something and play it for for fun

3158
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:57,480
um but before that I would relax by just I don't know I don't think I relax something else honestly

3159
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:04,360
well see that's why I'm praying rapidly that I honestly think same dog same thing I was gonna

3160
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:09,320
say at first like I totally am with you digi on like it's just fun for me to like experience

3161
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:13,560
things and have opinions like good or bad or whatever and like just that part of the analyzing

3162
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,360
process is really enjoyable to me but what I like I kind of feel like it's like a larger issue

3163
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:24,600
like what this reminds me of is like like Sam Harris talks a lot about like the the like mental

3164
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:29,640
strain put on us just by being interacting with like social media in general and like what I think

3165
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:34,120
this is maybe cost of like it's like that shonen trope of like we're activating our like our latent

3166
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:39,720
potential but at the cost of our lifespan we're eating away at it to achieve extra 10 000 super

3167
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:46,680
points and like I like I feel like there's probably like a larger strain on like my mind day to day

3168
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:52,360
since I'm like trying to be critical about stuff that used to be you know pretty pretty non-critical

3169
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:56,280
of though I mean I don't know I've always been relatively critical yeah I don't I don't remember

3170
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:00,760
a time when I wasn't like this is the thing for me it's like I just wonder if maybe for both you

3171
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:06,120
and me and everybody it'd be helpful to like like what some people do like uh like a week out of the

3172
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,240
year or like a month with like no social media and like it's it's to force yourself even if that's

3173
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:16,600
your normal state of mind to like de-stress your brain or something and then maybe there'll be a

3174
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,520
time I mean definitely so I don't think he's really talking about social media though that's stressful

3175
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:26,600
for totally different reasons yeah they're different I just kind of mean like the like social media is

3176
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:33,320
like uh well yeah okay there social media is all bad and bad sure fair enough fair enough

3177
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:38,360
so I mean I guess I just say yeah I've always wanted to try I've never done this but like

3178
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:44,920
taking time off from like pretty much like like a real vacation of like putting down the phone

3179
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:50,760
not like going out of your way to like keep up with you know whatever like if you're a review guy

3180
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:54,840
because like that's the context you said oh you know what I realized I'm wrong I have an answer

3181
01:59:54,840 --> 02:00:00,840
to this question it's smoke weed obviously that's how I that's the number one because you reminded me

3182
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:06,280
because I went on sort of a vacation for Christmas um you know I went to May's house for the holidays

3183
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:11,480
and I was just like I showed up with the like in my mind I was like I'm not going to plan

3184
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:17,960
anything there's no stress all the videos I needed to come out are out I'm not worried about work

3185
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:21,640
I'm not worried about getting home I'm not worried about anything going on I'm just gonna sit on this

3186
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:28,680
couch smoke well you know vape a bunch of weed and watch Christmas specials and uh and I ended up

3187
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:35,080
the funny thing about it is that even in that mind state I tend to be even more creative and like

3188
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:39,880
have more answers of what I would want to make it maybe it's maybe it's like that fucking spike

3189
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:45,160
spiegel mindset of like when you relax like that's when you can be the most lethal or whatever when

3190
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:49,720
you're not putting the stress you can flow like water yeah when you I mean when you try to force

3191
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:55,400
yourself to to have ideas then you're constantly yeah you stress yourself out over not having them

3192
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,880
and then when they just naturally come to you it's like you're way more excited about them

3193
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:04,360
because it feels like it just sprung out of pure inspiration you know yeah which is a way better

3194
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:12,760
feeling than you know analyzing the SEO optimization and whatnot uh yeah yeah maybe I don't I'm trying

3195
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:18,200
to think because like I don't feel like I've had that many stress moments where I'm like I need to

3196
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:24,600
relax I think I'm just normally chill and then like it doesn't take much to get me feeling okay

3197
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:30,760
like I just go outside and I feel all right well let me I'm I'll give this guy like some

3198
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,840
some advice since he since he specifically mentioned like being a youtube's man or whatever

3199
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:40,840
whatever your project is what I'd say is it's important to have dedicated downtime which I

3200
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,600
don't have but I should yes like so if you work five days a week you should maybe one day a week

3201
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:51,640
I don't even want to do this but like to those who want to like optimize their living situation

3202
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:58,200
literally force yourself to do no work maybe for like I don't know a weekend that's every weekend

3203
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:02,360
that's a part of why I love going out to eat because it's like I can just put everything aside

3204
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:08,040
and be like I'm going out on this venture to go get food and enjoy myself and nothing no other

3205
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:13,800
thoughts need to enter my brain in this time you know yeah but like like for me dated like every

3206
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,800
day it's taken me a while to get my upload schedule back to it and you know people are waiting for

3207
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:22,680
the next we are going whatnot so like it's on my mind all the time as soon as a video comes out

3208
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:27,160
there's like a few seconds of peace and then I'm thinking it's time to think about the next one

3209
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:32,600
immediately and that's just the nature of the beast and that's that's the nature of youtube being

3210
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:37,560
like so much work for so much relatively low pay you know yeah unless you're one of the people

3211
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,680
just getting used to to getting used to doing all that work yep it's not for everybody it's not

3212
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:48,680
possibly not for the vast vast majority including me I think it's unhealthy for everyone yeah I mean

3213
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:53,720
I'm not a full-time youtuber maybe it will not work well with my psychology we'll find out one of

3214
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:58,760
these days um so yeah I don't know just give yourself breaks really and try to turn off the

3215
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:03,640
youtube stuff no matter what I don't know that's that's my thought uh and we've got this fucking

3216
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:08,600
garfield game is still loading I don't know whether it's ever gonna load do we have more of these

3217
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:16,040
these bad boys uh we've got one final voicemail to listen to and this one boy let me just okay

3218
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:20,120
let me just preface this this is actually a series of four voicemails that were sent in

3219
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:28,040
called sex with the young part one through four basically um and I'm sparing you the first three

3220
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:33,560
because they are not necessary and I'm just gonna show off the last one can you can you

3221
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:37,000
yeah let me I'll give you the it's just it starts out sex with the young part one

3222
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,440
is uh Vic Miniana calling in to let us know oh excellent you know he's very excited to be

3223
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:48,040
wait who's Vic Miniana you know uh current current voice actor dealing with some allegations

3224
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:56,520
right now unproven but you know he's definitely true though and um uh by the way it was very funny

3225
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:01,800
to watch like yesterday during your stream you're just like he's a rapist no one's accused him of

3226
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:07,080
rape he's a rapist no one is even acute and may is like did you we probably shouldn't like sling

3227
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:14,520
like accusations I said I said I am hey I'm just a parody character I have no indeed none of this

3228
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:21,800
is liable in any way right but I know what I believe fair enough fair enough um notable

3229
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:30,120
notable unconvicted monster slip through the legal cracks as it were um by not committing the crime

3230
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:37,560
in quotations I have no idea what the what the beef with Vic Miniana is right now but it doesn't

3231
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:42,120
matter I mean the beef should be that he has the most annoying voice of all time well you'll

3232
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:47,640
like how I smell number two otherwise watchable dubs Edward Elric called in in part two to let

3233
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:53,720
us know that he has a terrible voice and that he I want to save Al so you know that not really

3234
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:59,080
relevant to sex with a young but whatever um number three was Donatello calling in to let us know

3235
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:04,280
that he is picking up the mantle of sex with the young and he's running with that um and now here

3236
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:08,840
we are the final chapter by the way if you if people have a link to the SoundCloud you can go

3237
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:13,080
listen to these I don't know if they like have a link to it I put them all up there but in any case

3238
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:22,840
here's the final chapter of sex with the young finale go also hashtag kick vic and fucking punch

3239
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:35,720
Todd purely because of their terrible squealy annoying high-pitched day boy sissy boy pussy boy

3240
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:45,800
fuck boy femi ass queer ass shitty voices seriously not any of their sexual misconduct

3241
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:55,160
no god forbid I mean but the fact that the anime dubbing industry let their performances continue
