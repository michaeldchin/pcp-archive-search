00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello everyone and welcome to a special, I guess a bonus episode here on the Pro Crastinators channel.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Today, me and my airmanos are going to be talking about a little story you might have heard of called The Triflers.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,500
That's right, it's the world famous earth shattering book by our friend Mumkey Jones here.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,000
And we're just going to talk about it. I just read it on the plane from Anime Expo and I finished it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And I'm bursting with things to say about it and points to make and brilliant bits of rhetoric to expunge for my being.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
So that's why I'm here. I don't know what their excuse is for being here.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh, Mumkey for book sales. For book sales, of course.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah, I'm just here to sell books. I don't give a shit about you guys.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Jesse just read it last night, right?

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Last night, I bought it months ago. I read 10 pages. I got to the part where Don gets locked in the freezer and that's where I stopped.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's like 10 pages to half way through the book.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's pretty far. I couldn't pick the book up anymore because I just hate Mumkey so much.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Last night, because Nate had posted about it on Twitter, I'm like, oh god, everyone's still reading that damn book. I better finish it too.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,500
And then it was said that we do a podcast today and I was told that we might get a new member of the procrastinators and I had to put a stop to that.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Because every time we have a guest on the show, he becomes a real procrastinator. That's how I ended up with Mumkey in the first place.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So no more new procrastinators. I had to put a stop to it. I said, god damn it, if it'll stop someone else from being on this podcast, I will read the book tonight.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well now we're going to start all these rumors. We might as well save who this mystery man was who we wanted to prevent from joining the show.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was our good friend and horrible collaborator, the mysterious rhinoceros.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He'll never be a real member.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There but for the grace of god. There but for the grace of god goes a new addition to our merry brood.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I stayed up all night reading the book. I pulled a Mario Quintanilla only instead of teaching I was learning.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We should say that Tom wanted to be here but he's out of town right now so he couldn't.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's true. In all fairness, he's the one who read it before any of us.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Not before me. What the fuck are you talking about? I read it first.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh shit, you're right. I totally forgot because you don't matter.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But Tom's the first real person. He's the first real person who read it.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So we're all up to speed. We've all fucking read this book and we've got the author here.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's just dive the fuck in.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't know. Should we just talk about our general thoughts on having finished it?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've certainly got some strong feelings.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why don't you go ahead since you're like swimming at the fucking...

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You were remarkably affected by it it seems on Twitter.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Real quick before you start, I do want to say that since I was a young boy,

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
my dream of being an author was to like go on book tours and shit.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now just sitting in my bedroom with three of my friends online,

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
my stomach is in knots and I feel physically ill.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So maybe I don't have what it takes to go on a book tour with all these fucking people.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, that's what Maddox was like during his first book tour as I remember in some interview.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But then he became the God we all know today. So don't worry about it.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's all part of the growing process.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As long as my fall from grace is 15 years out, I think I'll be fine.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You know what? In all fairness, I should say,

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Monkey, is there any sort of preamble you want to give?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Anything we should say before diving into it just since you're the main man?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I mean, I guess I'll just say we're going to go into heavy spoilers probably,

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but really that shouldn't bother you too much.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And if you've already read it, then you should especially enjoy the podcast.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And yeah, I'd say if you can, I'd say go read it before listening to this.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you can, go buy it and then read it and then come listen to this in that order.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That would be best. But if you want to listen, hey,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you're going to get some interesting shit out of this anyway.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So right off the bat, it's very interesting the way that you've structured the book.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm just going with the super basic details here,

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but the way that you structured it from the perspective of multiple different protagonists,

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
they all count as protagonists, right?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that accurate? Is that the book lingo to use here?

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The point is you've got Don, you've got Mason,

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and you've got Mario as the main guys who are speaking here.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you've got Mario, the school shooter,

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don, the sociopathic manipulator evil character,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and Mason, kind of the didn't do nothing good guy.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ganky.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sorry about that.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, you should be sorry. This is professional work we're doing here.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, I mean, immediately, it took a while for me to figure out

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
kind of what Don's character was going to play into.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She's kind of like the main driver of everything that happens in the story,

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
for the most part, except obviously some shit goes down with Mario.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I mean, the book begins with we know he's the shooter,

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so it's not like that's a spoiler or anything.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We know he's doing the shooting, it's just building up to that point.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And so it's kind of learning backwards how things got to that point,

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and really what Mario might have done it regardless of what happened.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In fact, he probably would have, but it's the way that Don manipulates him

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and encourages him and makes things worse for him

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
when it was entirely possible that things could have gone better.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have a gigantic written-up analysis of Don's character here

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in this notepad document that I wrote while we were waiting to get together here,

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
just going into specifically the ending and why she is writing,

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because for her part, Don's input in the story is from the perspective

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
of a letter written to her mother after all the shit has gone down.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so I put together this whole big analysis of like,

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
okay, so Don is a sociopath who manipulated all these people in the triflers

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
into doing some fucked up shit.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it's very interesting because every account that we've got here

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is in the form of sort of a journal entry or Mario's manifesto,

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
or in Don's case, it's that letter written to her mother.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But the thing is that we learn at the very end of the fucking book

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
is that her letter was written, and I actually suspected this from the very beginning,

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don's letter was written with an agenda.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's full of at least several notable lies, and it's possible the entire thing was a lie.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So just for example, because Don's one of the characters that I am the most fascinated by.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I kind of relate to Mason the most, of course, as I'm sure everybody does.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And do you relate more to Mario?

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, I don't know if I relate to any of the characters in the story in the slightest.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mason's a totally normal kid, except for the fact that he's got severe depression.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The one who I felt like I understood the most was probably Don,

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
though because of the twist at the end, it's hard to say,

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
because it's hard to say how much of what she portrays about herself is actually what she's like.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The character that's portrayed in her story felt like someone I went to high school with,

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but a more clever and more sociopathic version of that person.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But seeing the big twist at the end kind of puts it into this perspective

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
where she has to be a lot smarter than the character she portrays.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because I think that the character that I was reading out of Don,

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
some of the stuff she would focus on in her letter is like,

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you have to be a fucking retard or some kind of weird autist to focus on these things.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But then you see at the end, well, okay, if it's all for a purpose,

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
then maybe she was doing that just to fuck with people.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, see, it's interesting, and I could tell that what Munky was going for

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
was trying to make Don, at least in her own eyes,

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
seem like she's the smartest dude ever and that she's got all her bases covered.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But I actually made a list of all the ways that she is weak and has made mistakes

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and all her failings.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A categorical spreadsheet of her failings.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I did, because I have great hope at the end of the book

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that Don is not nearly as smart as she thinks she is.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If the story that she wrote is mostly true,

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
then she definitely is not as smart as she thinks she is.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I'm aware that it's entirely possible.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Literally everything she wrote was a lie or fabricated,

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
which I found very interesting,

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and I suspected that from the beginning when she insisted that everything is 100% true

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
because nobody ever is, I don't know,

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
she's too smart to realize that she isn't coloring things with her own bias.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that stands out to me immediately as something notable.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So at the end, when she has the big bait and switch where Truman,

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
probably the worst character in the book in terms of the worst person,

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the worst person, because he's just such a weak, disgusting piece of shit,

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
possibly even worse than Don.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will say, you don't really hear from him until the very end

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
where we get some parts from his perspective.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I loved his character once we did just because he...

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think of all the characters in the story,

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the one that you did the best job capturing is the semi-retarded beta male orbiter.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He was perfect as that.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I actually have some criticisms there.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought it went a little too far.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like the childish writing, the spelling mistakes,

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
he seemed like he was literally retarded.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's the thing, he probably is literally retarded.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait, isn't that the whole point of the book is that every character is literally massively retarded?

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, there are plenty of mental illnesses to go around,

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
but I think only Truman descends into actual much dumber than the average person.

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The thing about this book is that all the characters really did remind me of people I knew in high school.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And him especially.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I had a face I could put to that guy.

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, I read Truman's lines, I see Jesse Wood's face.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's just a one-to-one correlation.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Bam, got him.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You got me.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Bury me with my money.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But that aside, at the end,

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
as soon as the shit went down,

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
we're going all over the place here,

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
so eventually we'll probably flesh out the plot more.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But at the end, after Mario has gone off to do his shooting spree,

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and Dawn has kind of,

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
she's gathered the trifles the day afterward for a meeting,

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the way she is described,

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and this is why I'll go through my list,

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but this is one of the many ways I don't think she's as smart as she pretends to be.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or she thinks she is.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Because according to her letter,

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the day after a school shooting,

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Chao's uncle, Tao,

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
brings home a fucking dude for them to do their evil human experiments on.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And it's like, how could he possibly think that was a good idea?

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And of course, it's all a cover for smuggling out Truman

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and explaining how people died,

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and not pretending that it wasn't her.

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I mean, it's, yes.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, I remember Digi pointed out almost immediately

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
when I went to his house the first time,

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
like, that's just the plot of a Serbian film.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Dawn is clearly writing out the plot of a Serbian film,

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
because it's even the same name as the character.

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, the guy who he captures

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is literally the main character of a Serbian film.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, it's literally that character

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is written into her story.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So she has, like,

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that's why I'm inclined to believe

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that that's the only part of the story

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that's like an outright lie,

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because of the fact that she's basically

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
just borrowing from a movie she saw,

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
like, you know,

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it's just so blatant that, like,

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which leads me to believe that, yeah,

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
she's not as smart as she thinks she is,

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
because this one little chunk of story

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
is so incongruous with everything else

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that sounds realistic,

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then this part just sounds completely batshit-insane,

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and also it's named after a movie character,

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
which surely the police could figure out

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
before too very long.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's totally in character with her,

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
because at the end, we see that in her notes,

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
she's thinking of just naming herself after Lily,

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
which is Mason's little sister,

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
so obviously she is just pulling names

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
for things she knows for all kinds of stuff,

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
so totally, totally consistent with

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the shit that she does.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, fuck Don.

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, just for the sake of clarification,

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
so Don is basically the ringleader

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
of the triflers,

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and as the story progresses,

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
she makes it quite clear,

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
who's goal in life is to

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
not really go out of her way to hurt people,

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but what she's going to do with her life

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
is perform a human experimentation,

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
like the Nazis,

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and sort of test the limits of

219
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
human pain endurance,

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and what they'll do before they accept death,

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and just all that kind of stuff

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that's not particularly useful,

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but she's very interested in,

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and she spells it out quite clearly,

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that there's no moral implication to it.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
She doesn't give a fuck if she's hurting people.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And we'll do whatever it takes to get there.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So she kind of harangues the whole

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
all the triflers. She gets rid of

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
guys like Mason, who are a moral impediment,

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
who would stop her through,

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and that process of doing that

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
was to me, by far,

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the most disturbing part of the entire

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
book, but like way worse

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
than human experimentation, kind of because

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, maybe it's just me being selfish,

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but whole like, kidnapping people,

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
chopping them up, making them kill themselves,

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that kind of stuff, that almost seems

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
cartoonish to me, whereas

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
women, you know,

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
false rape allegations, doing the kind

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
of things that she's done, I could totally

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
see happen, probably happen every single

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
day, ruin innocent men's lives,

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and terrified me to my core

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that it could someday happen to me. So

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm totally, you should have seen me on the plane

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
as I'm reading this book, surrounded by a grandma

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and some, and some

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
some hot little number on my other side

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
as I'm just, my face is going,

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ugh!

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Sitting on the plane

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
raping this grandma, thinking, oh, I hope

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
she doesn't falsely accuse me.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Exactly, exactly.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, I mean, that part of the book had the most impact

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
by far, not only because it

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
felt more real, but also just

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
it was such a perfect

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
like, because the thing is, to me

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
at that point in the book was

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
where I was starting to get bored

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and particularly

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
of Mason, because Mason's

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
thing is that he's kind of a normie.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Like, he's not a normie

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
normie, and this is another character

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
again, while I don't connect with

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Mason personally at all, he was another one

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I could put a face to from my high school

274
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
years, because like, there was always

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
like, that guy who hangs out

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
with kind of the freaks and weird...

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And that face is the face of Davoo.

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Not at all.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And of course, Mario would be monkey,

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
of course, of course. Yeah.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, I imagine Mario looking like

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
a munchie, actually.

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Wait, that cut out, looking like who?

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Like munchie, but like a short

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
version of munchie.

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Half Mexican, yeah, it's the whole thing.

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But anyways,

288
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Mason, you know,

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I knew kids in high school who kind of like

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
hung out with the freaks and weirdos

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
because their life wasn't really

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
like, normal, but

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
it's not that they thought the same way.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, like, Mason doesn't have

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
any like, mental disorders,

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
he just has a shitty home life.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So like, he connects with these people

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
who are much weirder than him

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because he doesn't feel normal

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because his home life is so shitty,

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but like, the way he actually acts

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
is not like these other people who are all like,

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
you know, actually crazy.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But like, as you go through,

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I kind of got that point, at first,

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
like learning about his home life and stuff, I was like, okay,

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you know, I've seen this story before.

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I know people who've been through this.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But that was the point of the character.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Eventually, though, it kind of starts to get to like,

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
okay, I get Mason,

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
because he doesn't really have a goal

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
the way that Mario and Don do.

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Just by the end, baby!

315
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
At some point, I'm like, okay, I'm kind of sick of hearing

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
from Mason, and it's right as I'm starting

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to really get sick of him,

319
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that the tables turn on him,

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and he gets written out in a big way.

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And like, the second that thing happened

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
where they say like, the police go to pick him up,

323
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I immediately flipped through the rest of the book

324
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
to see if Mason's name was at the top anymore,

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I saw that it wasn't, and I was like,

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
fuck!

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Just that realization that his story

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
has just ended, like,

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
75% of the way through the book

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
was probably my favorite moment in the whole book.

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It was by far the best.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Most disturbing, terrifies me to my core.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah, that's the real shit.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Turn your fucking audio down.

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, let's see here.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You know, if you like, I would love

337
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
to go through all the reasons why I think

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Dawn is a piece of shit retard, faggot bitch.

339
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
By all means.

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay, just dwell on that for a moment.

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Okay, so I wrote this down,

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
so forgive me if I'm just reading off my page here.

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The content of her letter.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What utility is served by Dawn

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
sending the letter? Why would she do it?

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ego and nothing more. She's still human

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and has weaknesses. Now, I'm aware

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
of the list that is composed

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
by Truman.

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There are exactly four reasons given

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
to why she would do it.

352
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I divide them into two categories.

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
One, emotional reasons

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that add risk to her doing so

355
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and add nothing other

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
than fulfilling her own ego.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And those are freeing Mason

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and taking credit for the Ricardo Fire.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why in the fuck would Dawn do

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
something that in any way

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
makes her life more risky

362
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
just to help Mason? It doesn't make sense.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But putting that aside, there's also

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
two good reasons to do it.

365
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I thought it was being implied,

366
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
especially through Truman's dialogue at the end of the book,

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that Dawn actually did like

368
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mason. Like, she's actually

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
in love with him, I thought.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Unacceptable. There's no way that this...

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If she loved him, she... Okay, I mean

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that is unfathomable to me.

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Any feeling she has

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
cannot be equated to love.

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think she lied

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
about the sex being terrible

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and that she actually had

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
a thing for him. Because Truman's getting...

379
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Truman keeps saying how

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
she'll get like...

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, she's getting way into writing

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
about him or that she's ignoring Truman

383
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and stuff. Truman who she's obviously using

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and doesn't give a fuck about.

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here's where the black pills come out

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
because love isn't a real thing.

387
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Especially... What does that have

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
anything to do with...

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're saying that she likes him.

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What does it mean to like someone?

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
To be willing to frame them for rape

392
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of you or her little sister

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
or his little sister and send them to jail?

394
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
She needed to do that to get out of

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
what she... She needed to get him out of the way

396
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
but then she still cares about him

397
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
enough to free him.

398
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That seemed obvious to me.

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mumki, do you want to pitch in on this?

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you have an opinion?

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean, of course I do have an opinion

402
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because I know what happens

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but I don't like to

404
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
answer questions in terms of

405
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
people trying to like

406
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
translate the book or interpretations

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
because it ruins people's

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
interpretations so I'd rather sit out on that one.

409
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's fair.

410
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, okay, I guess we'll just have to have a disagreement there

411
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but I don't see how you could possibly claim.

412
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Was either of those an interpretation that you had not even thought of though?

413
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like...

414
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is the possibility that Don

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
is in love with him intentionally

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
written into the book as a possibility?

417
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Even Al can see there's a possibility.

418
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I just find it ridiculous.

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Because I think a lot of the last part

420
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
of the book is clearly

421
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
throwing in lots and lots of implications

422
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
so that you can come to different conclusions

423
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but without it being

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
ever, you know.

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like, how much of the stories lie,

426
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
how much of this and that. There's deliberately no answer

427
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but there's lots and lots of implications

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that could drag you in different directions

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and I just thought there was a lot of implications suggesting

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
especially in what Truman was saying

431
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
about Don writing the letter

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
that she is in love with Mason

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and won't admit it because she's too proud.

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What...

435
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, here's the thing though. I literally don't care

436
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
about the answer to that question.

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Whatever her feelings are

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
we're done with her feelings.

439
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Her feelings don't matter anymore.

440
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Not interested. She has done these things

441
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm just trying to explain that this is why

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean I'm not saying it was a good idea

443
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
for her to...

444
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's the relevance here?

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm saying this is why she incriminated herself.

446
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's not that it was a good idea to do so

447
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but she wanted to get him off the hook

448
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
because they're already after her.

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's fine.

450
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
She's not as the bad guy

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but so why not just stack the extra allegations

452
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
on herself and let Jason skate

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
if she likes...the Mason skate if she likes him.

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well that's fine but she is now

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
unleashed what she must have known

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
would be at the very least a vindictive agent

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
someone who's not going to be too thrilled

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
about the shit that just went down.

459
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't think she's smart enough

460
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
to realize that he would like

461
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
become a fucking...

462
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Vigilante hero, man.

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Exactly.

464
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah okay maybe

465
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but see that's exactly what I wanted to get to.

466
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In this way Don has shown that she is weak

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and that she has flaws

468
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and that she is not an impenetrable

469
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
logical fortress. I mean that's obvious.

470
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
She has these kind of flaws.

471
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It just gives me hope.

472
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It just makes me happy about the ending

473
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
because we've got, I forget what the guy's name was,

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Grimes, the crime guy.

475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The true hero of the book, the only character

476
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
who I found remotely relatable

477
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
especially is Ron Clacker

478
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
who's going to bring justice to the world.

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He has a lust for justice.

480
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's going to take her down

481
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in the sequel written by me.

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I can't wait, I can't wait.

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I actually would kind of love

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
a trifle sequel written by Jesse

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
about like Mason and that agent

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
trying to take down Don.

487
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He teams up with Truman Sinclair

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
who was the real mastermind all along.

489
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He was playing that bitch for a fool the whole time.

490
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Now he's just using her.

491
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Now he's got this hot blonde girlfriend.

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He just wanted her to be blonde the whole book.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That was the whole plan.

494
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That was the gambit.

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He's portraying himself like a humble beta orbiter

496
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
but in truth he's the fucking Omega male.

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's all part of his

498
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Machiavellian schemes

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
to slam that plus.

500
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When a beta goes that beta

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
it goes all the way to Omega. His power

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
circles around and becomes infinite.

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
My god, yes.

504
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's kind of like retard strength only socially applied.

505
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Same kind of shit there.

506
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I read the ending as

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
personally I don't feel I need a sequel at all

508
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because in my mind I now know

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
that it was clear all along

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but I know that Don has flaws

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and that there are two hot

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
male heroes on the case

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to take down this weak

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
cowardly woman. And if Ronda Rousey

515
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
can't take Jesse

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
then we know

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that Don cannot handle these two men.

518
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Two men.

519
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I would kick Don Bracken's ass.

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
She's like a 15 year old girl.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'd throw her in the fucking toilet.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So yeah, I mean

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
my impression of Don throughout the story

524
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
is that the way she's meant to be

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
is just extremely pretentious.

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like she really thinks she's hot shit

527
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but it's constantly evidence

528
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that she is not.

529
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Not just in her actions

530
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that she's petty and retarded.

531
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Because she's a fucking teenager

532
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and she acts like a teenager.

533
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The things that she thinks are a big deal

534
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
are just not.

535
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
She's so obsessed with those swearing.

536
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And I knew girls like that in high school.

537
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I knew people who were like

538
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
swearing is for

539
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
uneducated people.

540
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I know that kind of pretentious bitch

541
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and she totally reminded me of that.

542
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So the whole book I always saw her as

543
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
this grating pretentious asshole

544
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
who was just

545
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
who thought she was hot shit

546
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and the only reason that she succeeds

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is that everyone around her is even more retarded.

548
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's right.

549
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
In that moment when she meets

550
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the detectives

551
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you definitely have this sense of

552
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
these people are fucking adults

553
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and they're way beyond her

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and they're going to

555
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
there's gonna be a way

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
they can get her.

557
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The end of the book doesn't really leave her

558
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
in the context of winning this one.

559
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
She's got all these things she's trying to do

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
while she's on the escape

561
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
but none of it is very convincing

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that it's gonna work out for much longer.

563
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They've figured out

564
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
who she is.

565
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They're gonna chase her down. It can't be that hard

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to catch this girl

567
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
who has no fucking idea what she's doing.

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
She thinks she does but she's a fucking idiot.

569
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's what I love so much about her.

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The fact that she...

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Just to go back on that

572
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
because I love shitting on this fucking bitch

573
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
as I'm sure everyone does

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
she just represents everything evil.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Forgive me for getting a little redpilled here

576
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but she's like evil femininity at its worst

577
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
or at least she uses the tools at her disposal

578
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
particularly with Mason

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and manipulating Truman

580
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and the whole fucking thing there.

581
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The way that she's so

582
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
cataclysmically does not

583
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
understand Mario

584
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
does not know that one of her pawns

585
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
is about to go commit a fucking

586
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
school shooting tomorrow.

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's how you know she...

588
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
She sees herself as in control

589
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
but she does this thing

590
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and this I can relate to

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
because I kind of do the same thing

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which is that when things

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
don't go your way at all

594
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you just reframe it as though

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but she does that

596
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
so much that it's obvious

597
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
that she doesn't really have any control.

598
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
She finds out that Mario's doing this thing

599
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and she's like oh well

600
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
okay that's fine

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I can plan...

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
it's actually like this

603
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
this all works out.

604
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is exactly what I had in mind

605
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
this is okay

606
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but the reality is that her plans are completely fucked

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and that she's getting foiled left and right

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and having to change everything

609
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and you can do that for some time

610
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but how long before

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
it just pulls

612
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the rug gets pulled out from under her

613
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This bitch didn't even think

614
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
she was so

615
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
fucking dense. She didn't even realize

616
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that Joe was in the restaurant before the thing got burned down

617
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
didn't have any idea

618
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that there was a possibility that somebody would be there

619
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and that's just one of her many

620
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
many mistakes along the way

621
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and yeah she doesn't know what the fuck's going on

622
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well you know we're talking about

623
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
what a monster Don is

624
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
but we're not talking about

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
the other actual monster in the book

626
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that committed the shooting

627
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Mario who is

628
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
just as much if not more of a retarded faggot

629
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and represents everything wrong with the

630
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
entire world all at once

631
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
he's a stupid

632
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
like uncreative, unoriginal

633
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
he only speaks in like

634
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
4chan copy pastas

635
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
which...

636
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm not sure

637
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
he just speaks in

638
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
monkey videos

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is what I'm trying to say

640
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
two of my videos are just

641
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
direct cold from Mario

642
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I recognize a few passages

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
of just being your videos

644
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
well you know if we're segwaying from Don

645
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
he's basically a mumkey jones fan

646
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
is what he is

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
he's mumkey's entire fan base

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
in one wretched body

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
well you know the thing is

650
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
even though I'm fascinated by Don

651
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the great thing about that is

652
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the reason I even wanted to do this

653
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and I was tweeting about this before

654
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Don is pure evil and is basically

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
irredeemable by her own account

656
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
maybe she's

657
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
talking herself up, she's not actually sociopath

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but according to her account

659
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
she's not changed anytime soon

660
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
she is a constant evil force

661
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Mario on the other hand

662
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that's something we can do something about

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Mario is someone who could have been saved

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
by society

665
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
well stick with me

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm just saying that

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Don frames herself as like

668
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
in the end of the book she talks about how

669
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
there's a passage about how

670
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
what were the trifle is, what makes a trifle

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
or a trifle and she thinks about

672
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
oh were they all lonely, did they all have the same fascination with the macabre

673
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
no it wasn't any of those things

674
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
it's just that they were manipulable by me

675
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and I agree that that was the real problem here

676
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
these people had psychological

677
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
vulnerabilities that she exploited

678
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and so the way we can help that

679
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and we can talk about Mario specifically

680
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
cause he's obviously the biggest one

681
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
though Truman's no spring chicken either

682
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the murderer himself

683
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
yeah like that's what opened them up to this shit

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to being able to be manipulated

685
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
by things that we cannot change

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
we cannot change what's going on inside Don's head

687
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
she's always going to be evil

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
but we can help with guys like Mario

689
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and if he just had had some fucking friends

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he wouldn't have done this shit

691
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and you know like I rewatched

692
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Mumkey's um

693
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Elliot Roger, notice I didn't say Rogers

694
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Elliot Roger, I'm learning

695
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm getting better

696
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I watched that video beforehand

697
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and it was the two questions

698
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that he brought up at the beginning of that

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
why did this happen

700
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and how can we prevent it in the future

701
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
yes that's pretty much what was running through my mind

702
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the whole time thinking about Mario

703
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
well obviously Mario is based on Elliot Roger

704
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and so you know

705
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the parallel is obvious

706
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
what were you saying Jesse

707
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
well like Mario doesn't have any

708
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
real problems

709
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
all of his sadness

710
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and depression comes from the fact that he is

711
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
an obnoxious little spurred idiot

712
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
shit retarded butt boy

713
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
who can't make any friends

714
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
because he sucks that's no one else's fault

715
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
true I mean

716
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think it's um unrealistic

717
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to say like how do we help these people

718
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
oh we gotta we gotta go we gotta

719
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
find the weird little depressed people

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
who are mean to everyone and who suck and just be friends with them

721
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
so they'll be better that's ridiculous

722
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
some people just suck and they're evil

723
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
well even if

724
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the answer is that we can't do anything

725
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
about it until we have some sort of

726
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't know brain scanning

727
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
psychopath technology and then we can know

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
ahead of time what people are gonna do

729
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I would just like to know if there's

730
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
anything we can do

731
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and you know you're right you're right

732
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because especially the way Don frames it

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I love the way in this book the way

734
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
there are different accountings

735
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
of different events and that the way like Don

736
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I love how Mario goes into detail

737
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
about like all the conversations he had

738
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
with Don about like oh how I want to like

739
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
massacre everyone in the school and Don was totally like

740
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
yeah I want to fucking you know hang him up

741
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
by meat hooks and carve out their innards

742
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
or whatever it was but Don leaves that out of

743
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
her story entirely yeah clearly framing

744
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
herself as like oh I would never

745
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
delve into that kind of like bullshit

746
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I fucking love that that's that's that's

747
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
really great she's a pretentious bitch and Mario's

748
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Mario has no reason to be he's

749
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
completely Mario is just as pretentious

750
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and deluded I mean he has these fantasies

751
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that he's going to kill a bunch of people

752
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and all the betas will be alphas

753
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
now and no one will ever be depressed again

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
he's going to create a utopia I mean like

755
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
where do you even start with

756
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
what could fix that nothing can fix

757
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
that that's a that's a deep fucked up

758
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
idiot delusion yeah

759
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
well that's what I

760
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
you're not wrong personally like Mario's parts

761
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
are my favorite parts of the book because

762
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
they're hilarious like nothing causes

763
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
something like that that's just there's something fucking wrong

764
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
with you go to you belong in the trash

765
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
yeah I we that's not

766
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
good enough damn it that's good enough

767
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I kind of

768
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I kind of agree with

769
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Jesse because like we wouldn't know

770
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
like a guy like this

771
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
it's like like Jesse just said

772
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
we can't just like find a depressed guy

773
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
be like I'm going to be your best friend

774
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
we've been at antidepressants

775
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and you can debate about

776
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you know the ethics or the

777
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
value of antidepressants but they don't

778
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
make an antidepressant for stupid there's no

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
anti-stupid look look it's like

780
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but but he clearly

781
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
illustrates several

782
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
points in the story where I mean we're just going from

783
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
his words here obviously but there were ways

784
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that things could get better Mario was never even

785
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
on medicine at any point there's

786
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
ways that things could have gone

787
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
differently but no one could

788
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
ever possibly recognize that

789
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
like there's no way you can know when the doctor

790
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
in the when Mario talks about how the doctor

791
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
just blew him off and didn't take him

792
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
seriously and said just go talk to your general

793
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
practitioner whatever yes Mario should have

794
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
followed up with that but there were

795
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
there were moments where things could

796
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
have gone differently if the system was

797
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
more you know like the system is always

798
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
imperfect and that's the the problem

799
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
with all this stuff is that they try to

800
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
fix them yeah well

801
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
but the thing is the problem

802
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
isn't that nobody helped Mario

803
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the problem is that the system itself

804
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
needs fixing like it's

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
not that he needed fixing it's that the system

806
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
needs fixing is that you need to have the doctors

807
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
not be shit you know and stuff

808
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
like that I agree and so

809
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
yeah but

810
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
personally reading Mario's parts

811
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
if this is

812
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
my biggest criticism of this book

813
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and this is something I told

814
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
to monkey but I tried to avoid talking about it

815
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
online so it wouldn't color anyone's perception

816
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
who hasn't read it yet

817
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
it's just the fact that

818
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it slips into self-awareness

819
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
sometimes in ways

820
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that I think work against the

821
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
characters because with Mario

822
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
sometimes he reads like a parody

823
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
of a school shooter

824
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and sometimes he reads like a school shooter

825
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and so

826
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
even though that makes this part of the book hilarious

827
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
at times it also

828
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
kind of deflates parts of it where

829
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
there's moments I love

830
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
like okay when he goes on and on about how Death Note

831
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
inspired him that was like

832
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the perfect combination of hilarious

833
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and also totally I could see it

834
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
but then there's other times where he

835
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
goes on a rant that yeah does sound

836
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
too much like a monkey

837
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
video but I know monkey videos

838
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
when I watch them I can tell it's self-aware

839
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and it's not a fucking school shooter

840
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
writing it so when he

841
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
is able to have that level of cleverness

842
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
or to tell a funny joke

843
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I think well

844
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Elliot Roger couldn't tell a funny joke

845
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Elliot Roger's fucking retarded

846
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
his book reads like an insane person

847
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
wrote it you know Mario

848
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
sometimes seems retarded sometimes

849
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
he seems too clever and so

850
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
when he comes down to the end where he just fucks everything up

851
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and dies it's like this should

852
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
have been a more retarded character

853
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I think you know

854
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I mean I see

855
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
what you're saying I don't know if I

856
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
necessarily agree yeah there were

857
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
times where I thought

858
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't think anybody who commits

859
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a school shooting is a funny guy

860
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because funny people have friends

861
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and it won't happen

862
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
well but that's part of the delusion

863
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
what if the Joker committed a school shooting

864
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the Joker

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
yeah I'd be all smiles

866
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't know if the Joker is actually a funny guy

867
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
like

868
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
has the Joker ever actually said like

869
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
a joke that makes you laugh

870
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I thought the Joker said what he finds funny

871
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I would put Mark Hamill and Cesar Romero

872
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
in the funny category of jokers

873
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but that we're getting off on a tangent about with jokers

874
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
rating the funniness of jokers

875
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I feel that like the point of

876
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the Joker is not so much that he's funny

877
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
to other people but that what he himself

878
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
finds to be funny is

879
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
you know

880
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
terrorism I guess whatever he does

881
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
what does he consider it

882
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think the Joker is a terrorist

883
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I mean in the animated series

884
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
he's a crime lord but he's also a murderer

885
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
yeah all those things

886
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
all those good things

887
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
well uh yeah

888
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
alright that's fair you know I'm pretty good

889
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
at just diving into something

890
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and this is probably a negative on myself as like a critic

891
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm pretty easily able to get

892
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
absorbed in worlds I'm reading so there weren't

893
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
many times where I had difficulty

894
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
separating like the monkey

895
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
well I think it's I think it's the reason

896
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I felt this way is because I felt

897
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
so strongly that these characters reminded me

898
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of people that I've known

899
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
before that like when they did something

900
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that was incongruous with that then it would

901
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
it would take me out of it a little like with

902
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
with Dawn because she's

903
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
so pretentious and so up her

904
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
own ass and focuses on so many

905
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
weird details in her story there were

906
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
times where I thought she was too clever

907
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
as well where like she does something that I'm

908
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
like okay I don't believe

909
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that the person who thought that explaining

910
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
every fucking detail of her

911
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
work shift at the stupid goddamn ice cream

912
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
place was necessary is also

913
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
clever enough to write

914
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
this other sentence you know it's like can I

915
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
like like like monkey himself

916
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
is better at English

917
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and in creative writing than

918
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the characters that he's portraying

919
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
even though he sometimes is trying to portray

920
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the story like

921
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
sometimes he tries to write like a retard

922
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and sometimes he writes clever and

923
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the two can compete is what I mean

924
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to say you know I the only time

925
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I really felt like that was with Truman I mean

926
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
unless I never got the sense this character was actually

927
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
retarded I definitely

928
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
for a loop got the sense that

929
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
um that that monkey had stumbled

930
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
upon a great scheme

931
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
of making his book impossible

932
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
to criticize because it's written from the

933
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
perspective of three terrible writers

934
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
yeah true true

935
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
but that's again that's what I

936
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
mean when I say that sometimes the writing was

937
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
too good like it's

938
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it's just inconsistent where sometimes

939
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
it's like it's clever and

940
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
funny and it feels like a dark comedy which

941
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is how it kind of builds itself and then at other

942
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
times it feels like you're just looking into

943
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
the like when again when Don goes into

944
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
like everything about her work routine it was so

945
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
fucking unnecessary and I thought that part

946
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
of the book was completely boring because

947
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
it it's not

948
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
it's not funny it's not

949
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
really relevant she's just going on

950
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and on about everything they do

951
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
but it does get you kind of more into

952
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
like I'm looking at it and I'm thinking this

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is what a fucking 16 year old would write though

954
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
like she would think that this is all

955
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
necessary because I've read lots of stuff

956
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
written by teenagers because people

957
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
teenagers constantly submit to me their

958
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
work for my review

959
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and it's always full of unnecessary

960
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
bullshit information so reading a part

961
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
like that was more

962
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
boring as a story but better as

963
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
this is something a dumbass

964
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
16 year old pretentious bitch would write

965
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
whereas other parts where it's

966
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
like really you know there's like a clever twist

967
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and there's like a just right timed

968
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
piece of dialogue or something that's really funny

969
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm like okay that was great

970
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
oh what was the one I wanted to make them

971
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
look like you oh

972
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
got them fuck wheelchair

973
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
people oh yeah yeah that whole

974
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
big dramatic twist part

975
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that was that was I died inside

976
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
really bad I wanted to die I definitely

977
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
felt I like how he put her

978
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
on the school shooting list by the way

979
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
like she did anything fucking wrong

980
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
fuck you Mario you piece of shit

981
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
alright what did Marissa do

982
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
what did she do she did

983
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
nothing she did nothing wrong

984
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you're the bad person okay alright

985
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
go on yeah I definitely

986
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
um I felt far more

987
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
disturbed I guess you'd say

988
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
with Mario's chapters than with dawn's

989
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
chapters because

990
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
actual psychopaths like dawn

991
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the job something

992
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
actual psychopaths like dawn are you know pretty far

993
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and few and far between and

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
they're not as smart as they think they are and they usually

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
get caught but people like Mario

996
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
are fucking everywhere

997
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
um he is every

998
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
4-channer in the world he's every internet commenter

999
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
in the world and every redditor in the world

1000
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
they're all over the place they're all

1001
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
too stupid and deluded

1002
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to know how evil they are and how malicious

1003
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
they are and they're the real

1004
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
problem we need to take them out we need to put them

1005
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in a fucking meat grinder

1006
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
just like you know Mondo Burger you mess with Kurt

1007
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you go in the grinder that's what I say

1008
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
what the fuck is

1009
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Mondo Burger

1010
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
is that the prequel to Good Burger

1011
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
yeah it's the evil fast food chain

1012
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
in Good Burger

1013
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
that's right that's right

1014
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I haven't seen Good Burger in 15 years

1015
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
can we just talk real quickly

1016
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
about do you think it is

1017
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I was just wondering about this so nobody

1018
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
at any point ever

1019
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
like provided evidence

1020
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
besides Dawn's written word

1021
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
that there was actual like human

1022
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
experimentation that happened in that basement

1023
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
with like the first guy we know the second guy

1024
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
was fake obviously but the first guy

1025
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I found myself re-evaluating

1026
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
whether or not that was even true and if so

1027
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because this goes into like why

1028
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
she even wrote this letter like why give them

1029
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
all this material to like

1030
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
look into the fact that yes I am a

1031
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
super psychopathic monster

1032
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I want you to know about the fact that

1033
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I've committed these atrocities

1034
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
like what good is served by that

1035
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
other than just ego it was just ego

1036
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
we can just write it off as we go

1037
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
well that part is corroborated by Mario's part

1038
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I mean a lot of what Dawn says is

1039
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
can be called true because

1040
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
yeah Mario did say that they started doing that

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
he said something about that yeah

1042
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
yeah the FBI even brings it up he says

1043
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Mario says he was responsible for two deaths

1044
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and blue bitty blue

1045
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
oh shit that was two deaths

1046
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
fuck okay yeah I fucked that up

1047
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
incidentally I wonder about if

1048
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
why the fuck did she tell anyone though

1049
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
how many of the kids

1050
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
videos had you guys seen

1051
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
because I'd seen one man one jar before

1052
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so that was

1053
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
another interesting aspect of the story

1054
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
is how much of it is just real

1055
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
well sometimes it's

1056
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
interesting because some of them are monkey made up

1057
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and some of them are real videos

1058
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and it's because I've seen some of the real videos

1059
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
that it actually enhanced

1060
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
how disturbing the made up ones were

1061
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
because like because I can't

1062
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
tell I can't tell how many things I just

1063
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
haven't seen before so as I was reading this

1064
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
book probably the part that

1065
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
disturbed me the most was just

1066
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
monkey describing

1067
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
video tapes that the characters were watching

1068
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that was extremely disturbing for sure

1069
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and again I could never tell which ones are real

1070
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and which ones aren't because there were so many

1071
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
or at least a few

1072
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that I knew were real that I had seen

1073
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
like one man one jar which is the one where the guy

1074
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
puts a jar of bazaar and it breaks and he has to pull

1075
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
all the shards out

1076
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
fucking disgusting video

1077
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
but like I've not seen that one

1078
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
yeah it's on like porn

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
sites but

1080
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
yeah it's

1081
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
just knowing that that was real

1082
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and then thinking about like okay

1083
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
well if that one's real then maybe this one's real

1084
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
my mom just showed up with a bunch of food

1085
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and drinks you know what a bitch

1086
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm so sick of her one of these days I'm gonna kill her

1087
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and I'm gonna kill the whole world too

1088
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and make it a better place for

1089
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
podcasters like me

1090
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
that one moment where Don

1091
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
describes you know Mario's mom

1092
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
is just being such a nice lady that one time

1093
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
really really added a lot

1094
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
to when Mario just shows up to school with like her fucking

1095
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
blood all over his hands

1096
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
what did she do Mario did she deserve that is this justice

1097
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
guess so

1098
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
casualties of war I guess

1099
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
it's kind of funny that Jesse made that joke because Jesse

1100
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
does actually complain about his mom

1101
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
all the time and I have met his

1102
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
mom and she's an extremely sweet woman

1103
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
so

1104
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that's why he hates Mario hit

1105
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
too close to home hey Jesse

1106
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
oh boy

1107
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
like I remember

1108
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
when you told me or you were on

1109
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
some stream and you were saying that um

1110
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that uh that that boozy floozy

1111
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
was like friends with your mom and I was like

1112
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
huh I always thought Jesse's like

1113
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I imagined your mom is like I don't know

1114
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
like a total bitch or something

1115
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and then I met her and I was like oh she's just like

1116
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
a mid-western

1117
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
house mom she's just a mom

1118
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
yeah my mom

1119
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
is a saint and I always feel bad when I complain

1120
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
about her

1121
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
yeah well that's good you see

1122
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
shout out to Jesse's mom

1123
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and Jesse's mom yeah

1124
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and Jesse's whole household is nice I stayed there for a week

1125
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
had a good time

1126
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
aside from the shit rot that I caught

1127
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
in the uh

1128
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000

baby Groot

1130
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the real hero of this book baby Groot

1131
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
as he is the real hero of every book

1132
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
ever written

1133
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
uh yeah

1134
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
he's gonna be a essential character in

1135
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
my sequel it's gonna be a buddy

1136
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
cop movie with uh special agent Dale Cooper

1137
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
from Twin Peaks and baby Groot

1138
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and they're gonna take down Don

1139
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
they're gonna trap her in the black lodge

1140
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
where she belongs I gotta

1141
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
watch the new Twin Peaks I just remembered about that

1142
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
apparently it's shit so

1143
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
oh no

1144
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
have you been watching it Jess

1145
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I have been watching it

1146
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
because Victor was just telling me

1147
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that he just marathoned all of the original

1148
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it's very

1149
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
very slow and very methodical

1150
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and they're really taking their sweet time

1151
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
with everything that you want to see but I wouldn't

1152
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
call it bad

1153
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the people on the Twin Peaks

1154
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Reddit board are all of course kissing

1155
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
every episode's ass and calling them a genius

1156
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm not like

1157
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I can see where they're coming from

1158
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I can also see where people would say it's boring

1159
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but I don't know I'm invested I like it

1160
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to be fair

1161
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I thought that the original series

1162
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
has a lot of moments where it drags and gets

1163
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
pretty boring I thought so too Victor said

1164
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
he just like completely loved the

1165
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
entire thing like both seasons

1166
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
the whole franchise is something that you just

1167
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
like you stick to the bad parts because the good

1168
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
parts haven't of trying to make up for it

1169
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
all right well now we're reviewing

1170
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
like that we're on the Twin Peaks

1171
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
all right we're off all right we're off that

1172
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
now let's talk about

1173
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
let's talk about Mason

1174
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
just to see what we can get out of the character

1175
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
of Mason so it was interesting to me

1176
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
that you said did you that you couldn't really relate

1177
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
to the guy because to me he was painted to be

1178
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
basically the normal everyman

1179
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
well I'm not a normal everyman am I

1180
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so well I wouldn't really consider

1181
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
myself to be one either but just as like a moral

1182
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
agent you know what's interesting actually

1183
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I would I would I actually love the character

1184
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
of Dawn because Dawn is exactly

1185
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the opposite of me because while she is

1186
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
an amoral unfeeling

1187
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
psychopath wanting to hurt and kill people

1188
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I am an amoral

1189
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
unfeeling psychopath whose only desire is to

1190
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
make the world better for everyone that is what

1191
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I am this is my I don't

1192
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
give a fuck who I have to crush on my way

1193
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
to make their life great I will do

1194
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
it and I will I will take hostages

1195
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll do whatever is necessary to make the world

1196
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
better for everybody and

1197
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
so and and you know Mason just as like

1198
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the maybe it's just

1199
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
that my connection to him as like this guy

1200
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
being you know strung along

1201
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
by Dawn I don't know dude

1202
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
this shit really gets to me any of this

1203
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
kind of shit about an innocent guy

1204
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
just being I

1205
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I know I'm gonna go off your red pill

1206
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
migtown date we understand

1207
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I I I have such deep

1208
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
fear of the of the real power

1209
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
that women have socially over men and it

1210
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
it haunts me it haunts me all the

1211
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
time it doesn't you know why it doesn't haunt

1212
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
me because I'm not a rapist

1213
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
well that was

1214
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
was he a rapist was he a rapist Jesse

1215
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
yeah lock him up here's

1216
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
an accusation no actual proof what's

1217
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that a bunch of hearsay throw him away

1218
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
fucking lock him up I just fuck what do you

1219
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
mean there's a little girl come all over

1220
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
her that's proof that doesn't matter

1221
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
if it's true or not it's still

1222
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
she she she literally could have gone into

1223
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the bathroom after he jacked off and rubbed

1224
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
it on herself there was no proof that he

1225
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
ever do that that's ridiculous

1226
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
that would never happen it would never

1227
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
happen would never happen

1228
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
incidentally by far my favorite thing

1229
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that happens in the book is uh is really

1230
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
rubbing come all over her so let's

1231
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
let's talk about that because this

1232
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
that's a shitty meme that's a shitty meme

1233
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
look the incident is fine

1234
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
it's cool that people bring up that as

1235
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
like an interesting outstanding

1236
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
moment it's just me it's just me

1237
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
who brings it up all the time because

1238
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
it's well what I consider

1239
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
maybe it is just you I mean when I sell

1240
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the book to people I tell them

1241
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
there's an 11 year old rubbing come on

1242
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
herself okay see

1243
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
a thousand times more interesting to

1244
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
me than that is just the fact

1245
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
that a man is being destroyed for

1246
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
having done nothing wrong well sure

1247
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
that's the emotional content

1248
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
of the book that's not that's intellectual

1249
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
content rubbing come on your body

1250
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
is not intellectually interesting it's

1251
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
viscerally interesting I don't know

1252
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't know if I agree that

1253
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Mason is totally innocent

1254
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
or totally like a nice guy

1255
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
not bad at all I mean he's not

1256
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
so he's not as evil as the other

1257
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
two but he's pretty

1258
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
annoying yeah and he's complicit

1259
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
in a lot of which is

1260
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
black him out he's a dumb teenager

1261
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
he's pretty cringy yeah his desire

1262
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
to fuck Don does

1263
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
make him complicit in a lot

1264
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
of bad activity what the

1265
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
fuck are you even talking about it's

1266
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
clearly painted in the story that

1267
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
everything okay I mean the fact that

1268
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Mason take her words as joke the fact

1269
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that they're just that's true

1270
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
the triflers at all

1271
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
makes him a fucking retard

1272
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
like all right you personally have

1273
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
admitted to watching that that clip

1274
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
of the guy in the ass are you

1275
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
are you first of all are you as

1276
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
evil as true I mean I never said

1277
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I wanted to watch that video or that

1278
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I enjoyed it in any way in fact

1279
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
by society I guess

1280
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I

1281
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
think that if you're too stupid

1282
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
to notice that the people

1283
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
you're hanging out with our weird

1284
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
gross grimy greasy pieces of shit

1285
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
then you're probably just as bad

1286
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
yeah I mean like he

1287
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
look he got played I will fully admit

1288
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
he's weak I mean he's definitely weak

1289
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
you're not you're not evil

1290
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
but being a certain level of stupid

1291
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
to me is complicit

1292
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
in evil

1293
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I just think I think Mason

1294
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
turned a blind eye

1295
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
to a lot of things because

1296
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
of the fact that he wanted to fuck Don

1297
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think there's a lot of shit he could

1298
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
have recognized he could have seen

1299
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
where things were going but he let

1300
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
himself be blinded because all he cared

1301
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
about was how badly he liked this girl

1302
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and it's because it was an escape

1303
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
from how shit his life is you know

1304
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
his he hates his dad he's trying to get out

1305
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
of the house he's you know trying to finish

1306
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
school and all he's thinking about is like

1307
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
this sort of fantasy this escapism that

1308
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
he gets from imagining that he's gonna get

1309
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to fuck this girl you know and hoping

1310
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that she'll like him and like that

1311
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
it's an escape from his life but it's allowed him

1312
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
to turn a blind eye to all the bullshit

1313
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
going on in the triflers you know oh yeah

1314
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
it's not like he had any desire to like move

1315
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
away and save his little sister he only

1316
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
cared about fucking this guy you guys are

1317
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
totally blown away

1318
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
why do you keep putting words in my mouth

1319
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you just paid it that you just

1320
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
when did I ever say that

1321
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
when did I say that I did not say that

1322
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I said that he's so

1323
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
worried about it he's so concerned

1324
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
about it I didn't say it's the only thing

1325
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
he's thinking about I said

1326
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that he is blinded because

1327
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
his life is shit and he

1328
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
can't do anything about it so he's

1329
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
obsessed with this girl and

1330
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
he's thinking about her all the time

1331
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and he's turning a blind eye to all the

1332
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
bullshit just because he can't you know

1333
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
he's doing it because

1334
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
he can't get away he can't

1335
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
escape yet he wants to but he can't

1336
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
so he needs something to keep him

1337
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
fucking sane and that thing

1338
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
is obsessing over this girl but he

1339
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
should recognize at some point that

1340
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
A, Don is a piece of shit who doesn't

1341
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
give a fuck about him and that should have been obvious from the beginning

1342
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
he should have recognized that all of her friends

1343
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
are pieces of shit that the kind of videos they were

1344
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
watching is fucked up I mean

1345
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
this guy is not into this stuff

1346
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
he's admits himself you know he doesn't

1347
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
find these videos interesting he's concerned

1348
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
about these people but just because he wants to

1349
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
fuck Don so badly he'll just

1350
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
go along with all of it just keep saying yes

1351
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and that's a dangerous kind of thing that

1352
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
totally happens you know

1353
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
he'll go along with it is just

1354
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
continue to show up to meetings and watch stuff

1355
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
it's not like he ever agreed like because that's the

1356
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
thing he had to go because he was too good

1357
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
because he would have stopped because he has a moral

1358
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
compass whereas the others are you know

1359
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
too weak I found

1360
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
a lot of Mason's chapters to be

1361
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
pretty uncomfortable and particularly

1362
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
cringy because I could

1363
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
relate to them they did remind me

1364
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
of stuff that I said back

1365
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
when I was in high school like the parts where he's

1366
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
talking about you know

1367
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
girlfriend and Don and like

1368
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
you know trying to like scheme his way

1369
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
you know out of one relationship

1370
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
it really reminded me of like the way I used

1371
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
to think about girls all the time

1372
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
when I was in high school so that was

1373
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
really cringy of me because you know relating to it doesn't

1374
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
make me not able to see that it's fucked up

1375
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and evil and stupid just like the other

1376
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
two's behavior um I

1377
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
what would stop stop

1378
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it's like you're putting him on the same level

1379
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
as the other people I'm not I'm not

1380
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
okay we're talking about look let's

1381
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
put him on a scale all right I'm

1382
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
complimenting

1383
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
he's writing you Claude by

1384
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
saying that fucking all the characters

1385
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
were equally uncomfortable

1386
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
which I think was the intent for different

1387
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
reasons and and Nate you

1388
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you gotta understand it's like saying

1389
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
you know you got you got

1390
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
you got Don she's like

1391
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Aromanga sensei level bad

1392
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
right and you got Mario

1393
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Kintania and he's like the asterisk war bad

1394
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and then you've got you've got

1395
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
mason and he's like re-zero bad

1396
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
you know he's re-zero

1397
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
bad but they're there's a sky

1398
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
whale of a human being I

1399
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I will masquerading as a man

1400
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I legitimately think it's unfair

1401
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
to call Mason a bad person I don't

1402
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
know a bad person I'm

1403
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
just saying that he's a little

1404
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
complicit and not totally innocent and that

1405
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I think that he's

1406
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
an annoying teenager which you know

1407
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
fuck and he's boring which is the worst thing

1408
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
that a person can be look look

1409
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I just want to be like if you're saying that he's

1410
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I question that like I question

1411
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
whether

1412
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I think he I question

1413
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
whether he's also a sociopath

1414
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
like Mario and Don I mean

1415
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
you could almost call the book two sociopaths

1416
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and a psychopath I think I think Don

1417
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
is the psycho but I but I

1418
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
you know Mario's obviously a sociopath I

1419
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
you know I wonder if he really

1420
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
gives a shit about anyone but himself

1421
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
because all of his writing and everything

1422
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
his narration is all very focused on

1423
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
himself what house

1424
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
how are things going to turn out well for him

1425
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
he doesn't really go with a teenager dude he's

1426
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
15 exactly all

1427
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
just like sociopaths yeah

1428
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
oh wait he's he's a he's a he's a

1429
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
whether he really even cares about his sister

1430
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
or whether he's just you know he wants

1431
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
to help her to feel better about himself

1432
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
or something because he the way he

1433
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
literally antagonizes dad doesn't

1434
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
give a shit about his girlfriend he doesn't

1435
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
really give a shit about Don other than he's

1436
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
infatuated with her because he wants to fuck her

1437
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and that puss it's ridiculous

1438
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to say he doesn't care about his sister he would

1439
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
literally antagonize his dad so that he would

1440
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
beat him instead of the sister

1441
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
how can you argue that he doesn't care about

1442
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
are you and he doesn't I'm just saying I wonder

1443
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm saying I wonder I'm

1444
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
being well here's a proof to the contrary

1445
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
all right fine I just

1446
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and for what it's worth the second

1447
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
that Lily did something

1448
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
of her own accord that

1449
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
he completely turns on her like that

1450
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
yeah as soon as she takes a look at pictures

1451
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
he starts sounding exactly like Mario

1452
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
oh yeah yeah he was mad at her

1453
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and then he got over at the next

1454
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
entry what a bad person

1455
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
to be mad at someone

1456
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
blowing this way out of proportion nobody

1457
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
saying you're a bad guy we're saying

1458
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
that he turned on her like that's some sort of

1459
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
like yeah he broke up all

1460
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
time no one said it was

1461
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
irritable you mother fucker

1462
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
yeah it's normal normal people suck

1463
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
normal people are horrible it's

1464
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
normal for people to be shit half

1465
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the time half of their lives

1466
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
what context are we coming at this from

1467
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
from having normal human expectations for

1468
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
characters or expecting them all to be

1469
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
literally perfect paradise of goodness

1470
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
look worse things happen

1471
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
to Mason than he deserved but he's

1472
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
not a great guy he's just

1473
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
a shitty teenager like every other one

1474
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you knew in high school he's no

1475
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
look Mario and Don are worse than

1476
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
anybody I've ever known yes

1477
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
nobody I well okay that's not fair because

1478
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I knew a school shooter so Mario

1479
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
was as bad as the worst guy I've ever

1480
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
known and Don's may be a little bit worse

1481
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
but Mason is just like

1482
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
a lot of kids I knew in high school

1483
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
who were just fucking dumb burnout kids

1484
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
who didn't know what their lives

1485
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
sucked so they had no plans

1486
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and they just fucked around and they made a lot of bad

1487
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
decisions he didn't deserve to have

1488
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
the things happen to him that did but

1489
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
he's not a good guy he's not someone you root

1490
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
for he's just kind of a shitty

1491
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
little teenager who gets a lot worse

1492
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
than he deserves you know but like at

1493
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
no point was I like yeah Mason

1494
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
you go until the very end where he gets

1495
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
like a and it's only because he becomes

1496
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
the punisher yeah it's only

1497
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
because like so severe

1498
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
of stuff happens to him that yeah he

1499
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
basically has like a superhero backstory

1500
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
now and now he's interesting at the very

1501
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
end but like throughout the book he's fucking

1502
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
completely lame and that's kind of the point

1503
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
that's why it's actually kind of cathartic

1504
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
when all the bad shit happens to him

1505
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
because it's like oh thank god we wrote out

1506
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
the boring guy and now we get to focus on the cool characters

1507
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
for a while you know

1508
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
like fuck Mason

1509
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
you guys are ridiculous

1510
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I disagree that his chapters are boring

1511
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think they were

1512
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
you know just as interesting as the other two characters

1513
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I thought they were interesting at first

1514
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but eventually I just

1515
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
but I do definitely think fuck him

1516
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
yeah when he

1517
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
writes when he confesses

1518
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
in his entry I mean of course

1519
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
of course he's the normie of course he's got the least

1520
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
interesting thing his

1521
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
you know it's not like his problems weren't the worst

1522
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
his problems actually were the worst

1523
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
of any character and yet

1524
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
he puts up with it the most

1525
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
he is the best person despite having the worst

1526
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
situation you know what Nate you've swayed me

1527
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
what I agree thank you

1528
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
thank you I mean that's objectively true

1529
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I mean again like it's just that

1530
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
his problems are all real stuff that

1531
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
most of the people I know have gone through

1532
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and like it doesn't

1533
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
most people don't

1534
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
go through most people who are in that situation

1535
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
don't then get put into a far worse

1536
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
one like he does and most people

1537
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
don't become a vigilante superhero at the

1538
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
end of their story

1539
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
but you know Mason's

1540
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
started Will Smith

1541
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Mason's problems were stuff that I was

1542
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
like okay yeah this is what most of

1543
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
my friends were going through in high school

1544
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
they had shitty home situations

1545
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean I hung out with a bunch of fucking

1546
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
you know like potheads and stuff who were just trying

1547
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
to do anything to get away from the house because their lives

1548
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
fucking blue you know they had shitty

1549
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
parents who didn't know how to take care of

1550
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
them because they had kids when they weren't ready

1551
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and they lived in the ghetto like that was a lot of

1552
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
my friends so Mason to me was like

1553
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
yeah I know this guy I know this story

1554
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but he's not my friend

1555
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so I don't care about him the way I care about

1556
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
my friends you know I agree

1557
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
he had the least interesting things to say up

1558
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
to when things turned but the point of

1559
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
the character is that he represents

1560
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
normalcy yeah and of course that's not

1561
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
going to be fascinating relative normalcy

1562
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
so I don't disagree with you at all

1563
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
but to say that he's like well

1564
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I mean okay we already talked about like

1565
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
if he's complicit and yes I will 100% agree

1566
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
his own idiocy

1567
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
you know everyone's idiotic to a degree

1568
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
if they couldn't see what was going on here

1569
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
obviously shot him in the back

1570
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
but like the

1571
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
the impetus I mean obviously

1572
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
if you're dividing this up by percentages

1573
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm just saying he's gotta be like

1574
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
tiny compared to what's going on with these other people

1575
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
obviously

1576
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
we're comparing again

1577
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
re-zero bad

1578
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
which is to say 5 out of 10

1579
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
you know strong 5 light 6

1580
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
if you're lucky

1581
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
to guys who are bottom of the barrel

1582
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
worst scum of the earth

1583
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
you know a school shooter

1584
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and a fucking mass killer

1585
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
like these are the worst that we have to offer

1586
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
any big brother who protects

1587
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
his little sister from abuse from an abuse of father

1588
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I would put above a fucking like

1589
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
average he's better than average but okay

1590
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
did he really protect her though

1591
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or did he just get her beaten up more

1592
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
oh

1593
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
whatever let's move on

1594
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
we know the answer to this question

1595
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
how about

1596
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Doreen

1597
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Dobson I believe was the male name right

1598
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
is that the

1599
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the pretentious asshole trans person

1600
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
again very

1601
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
character I've seen

1602
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'll tell you man

1603
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
you portrayed an obnoxious

1604
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
SJW pretty accurately

1605
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
with that character

1606
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
like in the name I think was

1607
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Doreen and Donovan

1608
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Donovan was like

1609
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I want someone to make a Dobson joke

1610
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
as in the little blue bear guy

1611
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I mean it's easy enough to make fun

1612
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
of like a you know SJWs

1613
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and stuff and say

1614
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
okay they're all obnoxious pretentious

1615
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
shitheads but like it's not even

1616
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
that I think there's plenty of SJWs

1617
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
who are like fine this person

1618
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
though I have this is exactly

1619
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the type who

1620
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
gets on you on Tumblr

1621
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
you know like this is the

1622
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
the portrait of the stereotypical SJW

1623
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
but they do exist there are real people

1624
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
like that and well you know this is the

1625
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
character I this is the character

1626
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I think I most felt the hand of

1627
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Mumpkin as in like yeah by the way

1628
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
fuck these people don't like

1629
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
they're totally real like

1630
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
they are real and

1631
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and I thought he did a good enough job of

1632
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
like making it it didn't feel like

1633
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
um it didn't feel

1634
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
like just a parody because of the fact that he

1635
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
addressed the backstory that

1636
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that he became this way

1637
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
that he wasn't always like this but like

1638
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
now that he's learned the rhetoric of

1639
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
this movement of the social justice movement

1640
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
he's developing these feelings

1641
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
so even though he still hangs out with the fucking triflers

1642
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
who are like these terrible

1643
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
terrible people watching horrible videos like

1644
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
you know he's still hanging around but he's trying to like convert

1645
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
them to his new age like beliefs

1646
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and stuff and I thought that was totally believable

1647
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
like I've seen people make that transition

1648
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
before that is very interesting

1649
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and that it no pun intended

1650
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
right true it kind of shows

1651
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the characters like deference

1652
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
to power in that you know once once

1653
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
you know because in her life obviously

1654
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
she's following trends that's that's what

1655
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
she's all about um which

1656
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
you saw like oh I can get attention if I'm trans

1657
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
so I'll do that I mean just not that old

1658
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
actually but that's what this character was and

1659
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
not to distract from you too much

1660
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
sorry but um I actually

1661
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
thought I felt the hand of monkey

1662
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
perhaps too much just in the fact

1663
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
that the characters

1664
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
like like Don goes on this whole thing about

1665
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
how she's like you know oh I don't have any problem

1666
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
with trans people it's just the way that this

1667
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
character has to do that

1668
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
that felt a little too defensive where I was

1669
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
like why not just make her hate trans people

1670
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
or something or like Mario when he

1671
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I think he has a part where he does

1672
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
something like that with either trans

1673
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
or like blacks or something he has

1674
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
some kind of like defense

1675
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
logic and I was like no

1676
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
just let him be a fucking racist he's already

1677
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
a school shooter you know

1678
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
it did kind of great on me

1679
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
after a while and annoy me that all the

1680
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
characters sort of talk in youtube

1681
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
videos yeah like

1682
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
they'll be like in the middle of a conversation

1683
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and Don will just lapse into like an editorial

1684
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
on you know

1685
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Mario does it too and you know it's

1686
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
like I said before about not really

1687
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
being able to criticize it because

1688
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I don't know if that's intentional

1689
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
or if that's just the way that like Don

1690
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
writes but doesn't actually speak

1691
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I mean it felt a little too

1692
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
it's true it really felt

1693
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
a little too editorially at some

1694
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
parts I agree there were I noticed

1695
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that in moments and

1696
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
yeah like she would literally in her

1697
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
dialogue suddenly transform into

1698
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
a youtube video sometimes and

1699
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I think that's I mean

1700
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
you can defend it all you want I think it's clumsy

1701
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
writing monkey was 20 that's how 20

1702
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
year olds write so

1703
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
you know I'm gonna blame monkey for

1704
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
that one yeah you swayed

1705
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
me I'm gonna blame nobody to

1706
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the one time yeah it was definitely during the

1707
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
the train I mean don't get me wrong

1708
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I'm saying that because if you go read

1709
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
my light novel that I wrote when I was 20

1710
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that happens all the time

1711
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
characters will lapse into an editorial

1712
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
because I was used to editorial writing

1713
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
so you know like in the middle

1714
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
of a conversation a character will like

1715
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
psychoanalyze himself to explain

1716
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
to another one so

1717
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
you should be nisei oisin

1718
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
you're a genius nisei oisin does the same

1719
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
shit and he started when he was that age

1720
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
so yeah he never

1721
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
grew out of it they only

1722
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
whatever I don't it's silly to go back to

1723
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
but I'm just gonna finish my point anyway it was just that

1724
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Dorianne she was

1725
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
a bitch to social pressure decided to be

1726
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
a cool trans person and then

1727
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
when Dawn asserts herself

1728
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
as the leader of the group she

1729
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
notices she bows to the

1730
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
new authority in her life which is Dawn

1731
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
so shows that she is a weak, spineless person too

1732
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
there you go that's just the character

1733
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
how about

1734
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I mean there's not a lot to say about

1735
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Chao or Chao's uncle

1736
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
cause Chao's uncle first of all

1737
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
but the more interesting of the two

1738
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
just like a war vet who got a taste for blood

1739
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
wants to kill people thinks it's really cool

1740
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
those two also fascinated me in a way

1741
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and I have to ask Mumki did you have

1742
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Asian friends like that before

1743
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
are you talking to me you cut out

1744
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
yeah yeah did you have Asian friends

1745
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
like the two

1746
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
the brothers

1747
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
every single person in the tribe

1748
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
is based off of one of my high school friends

1749
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
yeah I figured because

1750
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
that particular brand of Asian

1751
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
household is familiar to me

1752
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
of like

1753
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
the kids

1754
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
the younger generation of the household

1755
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
just being super disaffected because

1756
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
their parents are from a completely different culture

1757
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and they just don't even know what's going on with their kids

1758
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
like

1759
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
there's a level of disconnect

1760
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
like you can tell the mother

1761
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
just literally does not understand her children

1762
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
cause they are American and she's not

1763
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
you know and so like

1764
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
she just tries to be the default mother

1765
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
because she does not understand what the hell

1766
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
well when's her brother right

1767
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
yeah but the brother

1768
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
is younger than her I think

1769
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
by a good amount and he being

1770
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
ex-military he kinda reminded me

1771
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
of like an evil version

1772
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
of

1773
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
my friend

1774
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
my Asian friend Donson who has a cousin who lives with them

1775
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
who's like that age and he's like

1776
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
similarly a very like physically active

1777
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
outgoing guy you know mostly kinda quiet

1778
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but like watches a lot of movies

1779
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and does a lot of travel and like lots of interesting

1780
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
random weird things and like

1781
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
this the you know

1782
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
the older guy kinda reminded

1783
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
me of that a little bit

1784
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
like they just everything about

1785
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
the way that house was described and the way the kids act

1786
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and everything I was like

1787
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
yeah I've been in that house before

1788
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and to some extent like not that exact

1789
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
one but it's like an accumulation

1790
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
of different Asian households I've been in

1791
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and I totally got it

1792
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I thought it was cool because

1793
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
the whole time I was picturing

1794
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
this veteran chow's uncle as Rambo

1795
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you know the returning vet

1796
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
he's back

1797
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
hey man this is really bad enough Casio but I'm back

1798
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and I just wanna hurt people now

1799
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
look at my fucking youtube videos guys

1800
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
yeah that's my Rambo impression

1801
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
that's um

1802
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I don't know I was picturing like imagine

1803
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
you know that scene where Don walks into his room

1804
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
to like tell him like hey let's start experimenting on people

1805
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
imagine like Rambo in the corner just like

1806
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
sitting there all bunched up just like

1807
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I love that she pretentiously

1808
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
criticizes him for having

1809
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
a pulp fiction and fight club poster

1810
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
that really stuck with me

1811
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
cause I would totally have

1812
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
those you know like

1813
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I it was

1814
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
yeah that's what that guy would have

1815
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
of course he would you know like

1816
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
yeah he's gonna have two

1817
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
good hyper masculine films in his fucking

1818
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you know well one's a hyper masculine

1819
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
film at least and the other one's comparable

1820
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
like yeah why wouldn't he

1821
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
it just a lot of the character details

1822
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
in this book really definitely

1823
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
resonated with me like every character felt like

1824
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
somebody who I kind of knew

1825
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and you know uh I feel like

1826
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Mumkey's high school friends are probably not

1827
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
similar from mine in

1828
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
in that case

1829
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
mm-hmm

1830
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I do want to mention about Chao

1831
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
was that his character was an experiment

1832
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
on my part to see

1833
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
how full fledged of a character

1834
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I could create who has zero

1835
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
lines of dialogue in the whole book

1836
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I was going to comment on that

1837
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
yeah I was going to see if you guys even noticed

1838
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
that he didn't say a single word

1839
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I did but only towards the end

1840
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
like there was a moment where I suddenly was like

1841
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
he's never spoken has he like

1842
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
uh yeah I thought you did a pretty

1843
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
okay job like I mean he's obviously like

1844
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the least interesting character because of it

1845
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
but I felt like I understood

1846
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
his character in spite of it I sort of like

1847
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
spaced out

1848
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
his entire existence in the story

1849
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
yeah like I thought like the Chao's uncle

1850
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
was just a guy called Chao's uncle

1851
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
it's

1852
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
isn't it fascinating though that the more active

1853
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
interesting character there would be referred to as Chao's uncle

1854
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
while Chao was just the non-entity

1855
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
in the in the situation

1856
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and one moment that really stuck

1857
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
out to me was when

1858
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
after the meeting after she and Tao

1859
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
you know the uncle talk

1860
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and they announced their plans to the group

1861
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and Chao just looks bored

1862
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
yeah very very interesting

1863
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
very interesting response I want to know what's

1864
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
going on with this guy I like that because I feel

1865
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
like he's just

1866
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
so utterly doesn't give a

1867
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
fuck that it like none of it

1868
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
matters like he's just he's a super alpha

1869
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
he doesn't give a fuck about anything

1870
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I mean I feel again like I've known

1871
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I've known people who are

1872
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
kind of like I assume he's probably a pretty

1873
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
smart guy who does well in school

1874
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and like but

1875
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but doesn't give a like has no particular

1876
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
opinions about anything just doesn't care

1877
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
just let's life pass by because he doesn't

1878
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
he has no aspirations

1879
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and no nothing to care about

1880
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
he's just letting the people around him control

1881
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and he hangs out with these with the triflers because

1882
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
probably his options are

1883
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
hang out with Asian kids or weirdos

1884
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because you know as an Asian

1885
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
kid you're probably not going to hang out with like

1886
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Jax and all the like white kids

1887
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
or whatever you know so you're going to end up

1888
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
hanging out with like the either the freaks

1889
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
or the other Asians and he ends up hanging out

1890
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
with the freaks you know

1891
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
yeah I love casual racism

1892
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Chinese people can't do anything

1893
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
not being racist I'm anything being sympathetic

1894
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
towards this is what like

1895
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
towards the weaker race of Asians

1896
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
my group of friends I was

1897
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
the freaks in high school you know

1898
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and like that's who are you

1899
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
saying that Asians are the freaks of society

1900
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm saying that

1901
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
like for instance my friend Brandon

1902
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Tolentino he hung out with this guy

1903
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
aren pretty much exclusively because

1904
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
both of them were Filipino and

1905
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
so they hung out together even though

1906
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
they weren't necessarily friends

1907
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
they just hung out because they were the

1908
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Filipino kids and that's what

1909
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
you just end up gravitating to people who are your race

1910
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
my high school is extremely mixed

1911
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
so we had like probably half the school

1912
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
was black half the school was white

1913
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and you know some percentage of other

1914
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
ethnicities and like

1915
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
the black kids all hung out together and the white

1916
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
kids all hung out together and the ethnic

1917
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
kids all hung out together and the only

1918
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
group that was like super mixed

1919
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
like you know they'll be mixing here and there

1920
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
but it was the freaks and weirdos who

1921
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
was a true

1922
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
multicultural group because we're internet denizens

1923
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and stuff we don't give a fuck you know

1924
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
we're outsiders we don't feel like we're part

1925
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
of our race so that's how a kid like that

1926
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
ends up with a group like that I think

1927
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
yeah yeah

1928
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
he was in a bit of an enigma to me um

1929
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
well shit

1930
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
what else we got have we talked enough about

1931
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Mario specifically because I feel like

1932
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
we might have glazed over him

1933
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
a little bit in our in our rush talk

1934
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
about other guys I love the way

1935
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
he's fat he is fat

1936
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
unfortunately I think the the best thing

1937
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
about Mario um in his

1938
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
presentation in this book is that

1939
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
this book shits on him in

1940
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
a big way like

1941
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
because I know he's based on Elliott Roger

1942
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and monkey's done he's read the entire

1943
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Elliott Roger um you know

1944
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
uh manifesto and all that

1945
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and one of the things about

1946
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
monkey's relationship relationship with Elliott Roger

1947
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
is that he does make fun of the guy

1948
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and point out that he's a fucking retarded idiot

1949
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and that's a big part of this

1950
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
book is that Mario spends this whole

1951
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
book building himself up and having all

1952
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
these grandiose opinions and in

1953
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the end he accomplishes almost nothing

1954
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
you know he just he goes

1955
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
in he he kills one

1956
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
guy who is the guy who stopped him

1957
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
who becomes a fucking martyr and a hero

1958
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
for all time you know his target

1959
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
as one of these people that have to be disposed

1960
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
of was the hero and

1961
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
save people the real the real lesson

1962
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
to take away from it is thank god that

1963
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
mass killers are always the weakest

1964
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
most beta pathetic people in society

1965
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
because if they were strong like

1966
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
me we'd all be doomed

1967
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
right well you know if they if they had avenues

1968
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
if they had levers at their disposal to climb

1969
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
social ranks and alleviate their issues they probably

1970
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
would but they that's the thing I just push to

1971
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
the point of desperation I love it because I feel

1972
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
like most people if they heard

1973
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
about a mass shooting book

1974
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
they would assume it's going to

1975
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
in some way glamorize it

1976
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
or painted as like this big epic thing

1977
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and the book there's a lot of build up

1978
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
to this school shooting so you're thinking

1979
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
it's gonna be this like huge epic

1980
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
bloodbath or a big action scene and instead

1981
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
the book goes way out of its way to undercut

1982
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
it as harshly as possible and so

1983
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
if you you know let's say someone

1984
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
tried to read this book thinking oh

1985
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm like some edge lords like oh I

1986
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
want to read about a fucking school shooting yeah

1987
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and then they get to that part and it just

1988
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
slaps them in the face with how retarded

1989
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
a school shooter is and how badly

1990
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
he fucks up you know I hope

1991
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
the school I hope that edge lords the world over

1992
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
read this book and realize how that's not

1993
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
yeah you got to be a little bit like dawn and realize

1994
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
that school shootings are highly inefficient

1995
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
at changing the world and god

1996
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
their beta depression

1997
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Mario's plan will finally be fulfilled

1998
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
we'll have a college school after all

1999
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Mario's biggest problem to me I think

2000
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
was a lack of self-awareness and even when

2001
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
done clearly point out that every school

2002
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
shooter is a lack of self-awareness

2003
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
they don't realize it's just not realizing

2004
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that it's your fault not the world's or

2005
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
or that the people who

2006
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
it is their fault you're completely misguided

2007
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
on who they are like Elliott Roger

2008
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
there's people he could have blamed but he

2009
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
didn't blame those people you know he

2010
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
blamed the girls who wouldn't

2011
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
sleep with him

2012
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
because they literally he just never even

2013
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
asked so because he never

2014
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
like so Mario you know his rage is

2015
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
completely misguided and the book

2016
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
points that out and shows

2017
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
it this book paints Mario as a fucking

2018
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
idiot and it paints his

2019
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
revenge is pathetic and it paints him as

2020
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
a failure and I think that's

2021
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
great because I don't think

2022
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
a lot of I don't think there's a lot of people who could have

2023
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
written that and still made it feel

2024
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
real like there's people who would have

2025
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
you know imagine like

2026
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a normie guy writing this book like

2027
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
someone who like heard about a school shooting who's just like

2028
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
some guy that read fucking 13 reasons

2029
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
why or some shit like that you know and that's

2030
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
the problem with 13 you know there's a

2031
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Netflix series airing right now and Victor

2032
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
pointed this out that in that show

2033
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
there's a character who they're building up to be a

2034
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
school shooter but he doesn't have the personality

2035
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
of one he doesn't act like what

2036
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
a school shooter would act like that any

2037
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
anyone could point that out Mario

2038
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
is a completely realized school

2039
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
shooter but the book still

2040
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
shits on him for being that you know and I

2041
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
think that's a cool aspect of it

2042
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
that uh was it was definitely

2043
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
one of the funnier twists in the book to

2044
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
read him just like utterly get shit on

2045
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
and fail horribly and it was

2046
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
like ah you dumb fuck

2047
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
which I mean I mean

2048
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
agreed the guy who I know the school

2049
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
shooter that I grew up with

2050
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
who was a friend of mine when I was a little kid

2051
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
um he didn't even get

2052
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
to accomplish it because he made youtube videos

2053
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
bragging about all his guns and how he was going to shoot

2054
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
up a school and so he got busted because

2055
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
he's a fucking retard so

2056
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
man what about that American

2057
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
hero who tackled Mario

2058
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and wrestled the grenade out of him and blew up

2059
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
that's Bryce

2060
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Bryce whatever yeah and

2061
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
what's great about that is that

2062
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Bryce Dallas thundercot

2063
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
what's great about that part is you know Mario

2064
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
had portrayed that guy as like

2065
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
this asshole normie piece of shit

2066
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
but he's clearly like

2067
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
yeah a total hero like he saves

2068
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
well that's kind of

2069
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
that's kind of what Jesse says all the time

2070
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
about he was spires to norminess

2071
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
yeah norminess is next to godliness

2072
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
when you're an outsider of society

2073
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
it's easy to just demonize everybody

2074
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
or view them as you know

2075
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
because they're ostracizing you and they must be evil

2076
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and you know to a certain extent it's kind of like

2077
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
um uh you know like

2078
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
uh an outsider mentality like if you're not one

2079
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
of us uh you know we're gonna treat you like

2080
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
shit but at the very least

2081
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
at the very least these people are they're pretty good

2082
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
to each other you know they they want to protect

2083
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
each other guys like Bryce

2084
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
not a bad guy certainly not a bad guy

2085
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
probably has parents in the

2086
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
he probably has like parents in the military

2087
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
who while strict with

2088
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
him and therefore he acts out

2089
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
they nonetheless are like very proud

2090
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
people like very America's

2091
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
beautiful place you gotta protect your citizens

2092
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
you know I bet that's the house he grew up

2093
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
see that that's the thing about guys like Mario

2094
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
or even guys like you know Isis or whatever

2095
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
like they they're viewing

2096
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
individuals as part of like

2097
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
guys like Isis

2098
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
not a not a fan

2099
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
of that guy uh yeah

2100
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
like these they they paint

2101
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
you know like they're the whole terrorist and Mario

2102
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
is literally a terrorist like he's hoping to

2103
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
inspire terror to make society

2104
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
change that's literally what what terrorism is

2105
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and um

2106
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
like you have to view people

2107
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
as part of a collective because he's just

2108
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Mario had specific targets right of course but Mario

2109
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
didn't care to like look into their stories

2110
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and and you can see this clearly

2111
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
that he was not even interested in diving

2112
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
deeper when he starts painting people

2113
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
like Marissa this angel who

2114
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
gave him a chance and was such a wonderful person

2115
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
him that he did everything wrong to

2116
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
and destroyed his own chances with he says like

2117
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I would have loved to have killed her too

2118
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
but she's not at this school because it's all about

2119
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
him and how he's the sad one and how

2120
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
you know the why hasn't life

2121
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and that's exactly what Elliot Roger was like

2122
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
that he was he wanted to kill his own little

2123
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
brother who he literally

2124
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
loved and who never did anything wrong

2125
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and he wanted to kill him so he wouldn't turn out

2126
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
because one day he will have sex

2127
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
one day he'll have sex and that's

2128
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
unacceptable that cannot happen

2129
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
what a fucking monster

2130
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
not

2131
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
a fan of that guy

2132
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
um which is why you know

2133
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
just on a little rant here I get pretty pissed

2134
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
when people like lion eyes Elliot

2135
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
or like celebrate him in any way

2136
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
because he's just a monster

2137
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
that no one should like

2138
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
admire in any way

2139
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
there's probably I'm sure there's a great deal of irony

2140
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
going on here but

2141
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
you know the water's getting muddy to some points

2142
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
so I guess I'm just saying don't get carried away

2143
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
with it folks he's not a good person

2144
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
he is a literal murderer

2145
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
if you saw you he would kill you

2146
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
so keep that in mind

2147
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
do we have anything else to say about the book?

2148
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
any untapped

2149
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
any um shit

2150
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
monkey is there anything you want to hear us

2151
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
talk about about your book?

2152
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
uh no nothing specific

2153
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I was just gonna say I've been waiting over a year

2154
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
to hear people have an actual conversation

2155
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
about this and I thought it would

2156
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
like when I was writing and I thought it would never happen

2157
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I thought nobody would read it so this last hour

2158
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
has been like pretty fucking great

2159
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
for me like even even the parts where you're

2160
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
shitting on some of the writing I'm thinking

2161
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
finally somebody is acknowledging

2162
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
what I did

2163
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that's great that's great all it takes is a hero

2164
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
like Nate Bestman to read your book

2165
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and bam instant well instant celebrity

2166
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
yeah I mean I talked to monkey

2167
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
about some of my issues with it back in

2168
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
March but I again

2169
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
wanted to hold off till more people had read it

2170
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
because I was literally the first person to

2171
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
read it because I got an early copy

2172
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
um so I didn't

2173
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
want to like air any of this out and like

2174
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
you know when people get it in their heads

2175
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
they're gonna read it that way like if anyone

2176
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
listened to this podcast before reading the book

2177
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
they're going to now read some of our criticisms

2178
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
into it but uh but they'll also

2179
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
read our more in-depth analysis

2180
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
into it so you know

2181
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I just want to say that I'm uh

2182
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I'm immensely proud of you monkey

2183
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
that you actually

2184
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
wrote this book and published it yourself

2185
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
and that you have an actual

2186
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
like a real novel under your belt

2187
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
that's amazing to me it's um

2188
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
it's a thing that I haven't done and it's a

2189
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
thing that I respect immensely far more

2190
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
than any ridiculous retarded

2191
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
YouTube video

2192
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
of course

2193
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I would say this book

2194
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
is the only thing I've ever made in my life

2195
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
that I'm proud of like all the YouTube is

2196
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
just like a fucking joke to me compared to this

2197
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
thing

2198
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
well that's nice

2199
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I'd say that just on a

2200
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't know a literary note I guess

2201
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
this thing was an absolute page turner

2202
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and consumed it

2203
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
uh voraciously

2204
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
and and loved reading it and it was really

2205
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
really good and

2206
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I read this book at night because

2207
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I was trying to read it before monkey got to my house

2208
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
um incidentally

2209
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I read the entire book while non-stop listening

2210
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
to slipknot corn and

2211
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Marilyn Manson um and I would

2212
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
highly recommend you do the same so you can get into

2213
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
the school shooter mindset but uh

2214
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I read the entire book listening to the

2215
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Stone Cold Steve Austin podcast

2216
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
talking about wrestling

2217
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
um and doing it for the working man

2218
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
give me a hell yeah

2219
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I will say that I think the

2220
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
early part

2221
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
there's like this book has a lot of build up

2222
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and I do think it's probably

2223
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
longer than it needs to be

2224
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
um I think that the mid

2225
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
section is the weak point when we

2226
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
get to dawn working at the ice cream

2227
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
place like up and like

2228
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
when she gets locked in the freezer pretty much

2229
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
everything from that onwards is

2230
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
great like that's where the book really takes

2231
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
off is after after she gets out of

2232
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
the freezer and all of her schemes from then on

2233
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
all of that is fantastic

2234
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
um and the early part where the setting up

2235
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
the characters is good but just that mid section

2236
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
when she gets the job and she goes into so much

2237
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
fucking detail about working there

2238
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I like had I not been trying

2239
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
to finish the book that night I would have been at risk

2240
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
of not finishing the book just because

2241
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I read books while I take a shit

2242
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
a lot of the time I try to get through

2243
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
like one chapter per shit and

2244
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
if I read a whole chapter of just dawn

2245
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
book and describe your workplace I would have been like

2246
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
okay and my name is

2247
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Don Blackie I work at

2248
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Jerry Queen I like to be mean to people

2249
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
and torture people I'm a really

2250
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
smart girl

2251
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
that's the whole book

2252
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I want the Jesse Wood audio

2253
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
book of the Triforce

2254
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
yeah that'd be great because that is Don's voice

2255
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
at all times through all her narration

2256
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I wear pig socks because I'm

2257
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
a girl

2258
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
well fucking exposed

2259
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I

2260
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I wanted to say that I

2261
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
yeah like I loved reading this

2262
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I tried my best to finish it

2263
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
in one sitting but I am a genius

2264
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
but I could not finish it in the four and a half

2265
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
hours of my first flight so I took till I came

2266
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
home from the trip I was on

2267
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
it was wonderful I

2268
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
was thoroughly entertained the whole way

2269
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I did not find

2270
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
like I was

2271
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
in hard enough by the point where she got to that

2272
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
where I was totally willing

2273
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
to take the journey that Don was providing

2274
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
me of like exploring her workplace

2275
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
because I knew that it was leading to something

2276
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and when the place burns down and you

2277
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
get to think about all the details that she gave

2278
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
us all going up in flames I enjoyed that

2279
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
immensely and I don't know

2280
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
maybe I had more patience or something for better or ill

2281
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I was I was disgusted

2282
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
on deep levels but in the right

2283
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
ways I was I was provoked

2284
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I was I was made to think about

2285
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
real things and I'm a very

2286
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I don't know very like issues driven kind of guy

2287
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and you really presented things in a way that

2288
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
that that that as you've

2289
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
shown that you're quite capable of doing

2290
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
you know really made me think

2291
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
about the real issues going on here behind

2292
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
the scenes not just a fucking

2293
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
puff piece about school shooters now cool

2294
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
they are you really got down to the

2295
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
deep issues and I could it seemed

2296
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
to me that a

2297
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
lot of it came from

2298
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
you know that not to go

2299
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
crazy with conspiracies here but like

2300
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
like you you really understood

2301
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
you know like the the the motivations that would go

2302
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
for a character like Mario

2303
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and and the way they're able to construct this

2304
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
you know not not like a complete rip off

2305
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
of Elliot or anything but like this new character

2306
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
you know having all the

2307
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
just a real clear understanding

2308
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
of why someone would be driven at this point

2309
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I thought was fascinating especially as someone

2310
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
who has probably never had anything

2311
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
close to clinical depression for me

2312
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
it was a very educating experience

2313
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
to just kind of dive down into this world

2314
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and see what it's like down there and

2315
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
to to I don't know maybe

2316
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
hopefully be able to use this experience

2317
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
to do what I think you want people

2318
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
to take away think about how to actively

2319
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
avoid this shit in the future

2320
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and see what we can do but

2321
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
that's that's where I'm at it was great

2322
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
loved it to summarize my thoughts

2323
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I mean I think this is a really

2324
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
impressive book and piece

2325
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
of work especially for having been written

2326
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
by a fucking 20 year old

2327
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
because again

2328
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I get inundated with people sending me shit

2329
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
they've written all the time I usually can't make it

2330
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
past the first paragraph or the first page

2331
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
this is from people who you know

2332
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
tout themselves as writers like

2333
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
people who really think oh my god

2334
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
this is what I'm gonna do and I love writing

2335
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and they send me something and it's bullshit

2336
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
you know I expected it to not be

2337
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
shit because your videos aren't shit

2338
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
but when I was started reading it I didn't expect

2339
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
to be like hooked and actually want to read

2340
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
the whole thing and I did

2341
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
you know it's obviously

2342
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
it's interesting if we could get this much fucking

2343
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
conversation out of it which is more than I could say

2344
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
for a lot of stories and

2345
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you know

2346
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I had a good time I would say

2347
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
you know weak parts aside it's still

2348
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
a really interesting book lots lots to

2349
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
relate to lots to connect with and

2350
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
for what it's worth I'm extremely excited

2351
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
to see where you'll go later because

2352
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
writing unlike any other

2353
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
medium is not something that anyone

2354
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
is a master at young

2355
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
there's never been

2356
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
a like world famous author

2357
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
who got world famous

2358
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
before their 30s like everyone

2359
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
has to work up for that

2360
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
what about the famous author

2361
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Harry Potter

2362
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
his series of autobiographies

2363
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
sold up trillion copies

2364
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I think the only outlier would be

2365
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Essie Hilton who wrote

2366
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
The Outsiders when she was like 16

2367
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
but otherwise you're pretty much right

2368
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
yeah authors never blow up huge

2369
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
when they're young it's one of the only mediums

2370
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
where like you really have to study at it

2371
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
for for a long time and so

2372
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
to be putting out something impressive

2373
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
enough that three

2374
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
relatively harsh critics mind you

2375
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
are I mean

2376
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I at least I'm a relatively harsh critic

2377
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
if this was interesting you'd know

2378
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
yeah you would definitely know

2379
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'd let you know so to have written that at

2380
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
20 I can't wait to see what you will

2381
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
be writing by the time you are 30 if

2382
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
you're still writing fiction

2383
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and if you still have ideas that are at

2384
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
least you know half as interesting as

2385
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
this one

2386
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I can only assume you'll get better as a writer

2387
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
as time goes on so yeah

2388
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you know I think I'm with didgy

2389
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
on the fact that I think simplicity might be key for your next

2390
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
work so when you're writing that and you say goodbye

2391
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
cruel world and you're heading out to that rope

2392
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
hanging in your closet that

2393
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
you know just just leave it at that you know

2394
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
just leave it at that

2395
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
what

2396
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
kill yourself I'm saying kill yourself

2397
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that's what I'm saying it's my next big magnum

2398
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
but it's your suicide

2399
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that's what I'm kidding that's the joke

2400
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
that's the joke okay good

2401
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
bam closer

2402
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
nailed it I think we should all agree

2403
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
that next week we'll come back together

2404
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and review that anime snobs

2405
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
book in the same way

2406
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
someone should

2407
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
read that and let me know how it is though

2408
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I was told it's an autistic version

2409
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
of dune

2410
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
that sounds like what you would write

2411
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
so I'm not surprised at all by that

2412
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
when did he write this when did he write it

2413
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
like a year ago

2414
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
oh we should have had him on this right now

2415
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
to review the book what were we thinking

2416
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
did he read it

2417
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I came in for the last part of the podcast

2418
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
he's never going to read it because I won't send him

2419
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
a pdf

2420
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
what a piece of shit

2421
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
well

2422
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
so long

2423
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
go buy the triflers on the link in the description

2424
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
if you haven't read it yet and you'd like to

2425
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
um

2426
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
written by monkey jones

2427
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
we're proud of it

2428
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
and we're not just saying that

2429
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and maybe someday

2430
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
we can be proud of him too

2431
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
yeah

2432
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
that's the whole point of my life

2433
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
is to make my parents proud

2434
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I haven't done it yet but hopefully someday

2435
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
well here's hoping

2436
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
