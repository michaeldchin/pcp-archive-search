00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm the best guy ever, and oh, who do we have here shuffling through my magic card hand?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Not me.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh, I play Ben Saint, regrettably.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, no. Unfortunately, I am unavailable for this recording.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's a blessing. Not in disguise.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
God's Gibbontake here.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yodelay, hee-hoo!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And Endless Jess.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Such a diverse cast.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What? Say that again?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is such a diverse cast. We all have a very strange-ness about us.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But it's all different strangeness.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a real ensemble piece.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh boy, let me tell ya.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Size.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
These lives we're living, I've had just about enough.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's gonna do it for me here, chief.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey guys, yes?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey there.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Face here for Nickelodeon Junior.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you say Nickelodeon Junior?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm having connection issues, but like emotional connection issues.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me just immediately say something to get us started right off the bat.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, there's been, you know people talk about pizza, right?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know, pizza, deep dish pizza, thin crust pizza,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ben, pizza face, you know, the whole-

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Keto pizza, Chicago deep dish, all the different classic styles.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And people generally like pizza, correct?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, I mean it's ingredients on a plate that's made that you can eat the plate.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I would say that pizza hits certain key demographics, yes.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, fair, fair.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But like there's urban centers where they say the best pizza is.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, some people are asshole elitists, and they're like,

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
oh I like grease, like olive oil on dough,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and then you put like paprika and fucking spinach,

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and that's real pizza, fuck off.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not talking to these idiots.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But you know, it's like the Chicago.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My favorite pizza is Papa Geno's from back home, Massachusetts area, New England.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's the best.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know, I have a fondness for Papa Geno's.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know if it's the best.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I don't know, there's probably some fancy Gordon Ramsay shit.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, it's my favorite like commercially available pizza.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, point of all this is, good pizza is a known thing.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
People like pizza, people eat good pizza.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have eaten pizza in Chicago, it's good.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've eaten it in New England, it's good.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've eaten it in New York.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have actually never had Chicago style pizza.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It remains a mystery to me.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think I have, and it's completely fucking generic.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's nothing special about it.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hate all this pizza elitism from Chicago and New York.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They think they're so fucking,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
hey, oh, New York pizza, the best pizza,

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and no Chicago pizza, the best pizza.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ah, you're both fucking stupid.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's just regular pizza.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's all about regular pizza.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's true, and there are different varieties, like whatever, thicker, thinner.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, fine.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right, but, but, here's the point of all this.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yesterday, I had, for the millionth time in my life, in Cincinnati,

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
there's what's known as La Rosa Pizza.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is like the Papagenos of the Ohio, probably Tri-County, Tri-State area.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Every time when I was at work, every time we got pizza, it was La Rosa's pizza.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the staple.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It is the number one pizza people get here.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, but yesterday, I was out with Michelle,

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and I'm like, Michelle, for your education, you haven't had La Rosa's pizza.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want you to taste it.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's go buy a whole pizza, taste it, and tell me what you think.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So let's go buy it, and just, just as it always is,

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
as it was every single fucking time they got it at work,

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
when there are so many other varieties available,

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it is the most bland, tasteless, terrible, cardboard, little bit of sauce.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Like, it's greasy, not too greasy.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's just terrible.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
La Rosa's pizza in Ohio is so bad.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It is so unbelievably flavorless and awful.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And yet, like, the professional environment in which I worked,

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
these people have some amount of taste.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I know people like to roast Ohio for having terrible food,

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and it's true, and it's true.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
La Rosa's pizza is the most vile.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I would rather get Papa John's any day, any day.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Domino's, any fucking day.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
La Rosa's is disgusting.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's, I just, I was blown away, and the point is Michelle agreed.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I gave it to her.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She's like, wow, this really is literally zero flavor.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is totally tasteless.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So it's been verified by an outside party.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I cannot believe, in a world of possibilities that we live in,

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that for years, I worked at this company for like four or five years or whatever,

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
every fucking time they went back to the same fucking well and got La Rosa's pizza.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You go to a theme park, La Rosa's is the only pizza chain that's there in this area.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's so shit when, like, Chicago is not even that far.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And sure, Jesse, Chicago, not like, there's nothing to fucking go crazy about

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but it has flavor.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It does taste like pizza and it's good.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
La Rosa's tastes horrible.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's terrible.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But everyone tells me that Chicago's pizza is like weird and like it's like more like a pie

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and it's like liquid and it's like a soup, just like a crust full of soup, like sauce and cheese.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, to be fair, I've only had Chicago pizza one time at the airport when I was flying through

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and I made sure to do it for the meme.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And that, my experience with that pizza was it was very thick and quite delicious.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So this is my one data point there.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I've had tons of other pizza.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Look, this is the real point.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There is literally zero flavor in this pizza.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They think they can get by with like cheese, which is the solution to every problem in Ohio,

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but it doesn't fucking work.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's no flip.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I was holding the pizza in my hand, moving it towards my mouth to take a bite

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the crust just crumbles away in my hand and it falls to the ground like the cardboard it is.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was lucky.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The entire slice didn't turn to dust as I moved it towards my mouth

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
evaporating, preventing me from eating any of it.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is just a public service announcement.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't eat LaRosa's.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's bad pizza.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It tastes like ass.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can do better.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ohio, you can do better Cincinnati.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There is everyone don't eat there.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's shit.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There is a pizza place right down the street from where I live and we've been there a couple times

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and it's not, it's just, it's just really unfortunate.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's really unfortunate.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like it's, it's, the slices are like soggy.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They come out there like soggy.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You pick up the slice and it just droops.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It is just like wet paper.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Just like, and it is, it's on the toppings are good, but like the crust is just like they just failed.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They just failed.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't even remember what this place is called.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There needs to be collected like a national index of all the bad pizza.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So people know because bad pizza is a tragedy that could happen to anyone at any time.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You never know until it's too late.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I mean, if you've had it before, you can go, that place sucks.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But you have to fucking, you have to dive in to the deep end first.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can figure that out.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's very, this is an eye-opening experience to warn people.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This was such an eye-opening experience to make me aware of how much better other pizza I've had in my life was.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I get like excited when I get a pizza from Papa Jean or something.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I get dread when I realize that there's LaRose's pizza.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But yes, I'll eat it anyway because it's fucking free.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Of course I'm going to take this moment to shout out a little known chain.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They don't have it around here.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think they maybe only have it in the south and maybe in California, I don't know.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They don't have it in New England, it's a shame.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But Jets Pizza.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I never hear anyone talk about Jets Pizza.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Jets is wicked good.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's like big rectangles.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like thick crust.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The crust is crunchy on the outside.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I wish Jets were everywhere.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If they were here, I would get it.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Only I wouldn't because it's not keto.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's fair.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I know that we've talked about preferences of pizza before.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There's an ongoing thick crust, thin crust debate.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I get fantasies dreaming about like,

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you know when you've got a thin crust pizza cooked just right?

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So the edges of the crust have a little bit of cheese and they've turned black.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And you know when you bite into them, you're going to get that crunch

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and that snap of those carcinogens passing in your body and giving you cancer.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But it's worth it.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Cheese is like boiling and you've got those delicious weird bubbles of dough

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
with the cheese on top and maybe there's some sauce on top.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Papa Jean has all about those crust bubbles.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I couldn't be a bigger fan.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I had a really good pizza experience when Munchie was visiting in London.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't remember the name of the place.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But there are quite a lot of Italians in London.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean it's closer to Italy so they can import all the good ingredients and stuff.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I keep saying it in every restaurant.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's like we got all the ingredients from this Italian town.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This tiny little Italian town.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We got the flour from here and we got whatever from there.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And it is such good pizza.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so Italian.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know how to describe.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's that sort of like really bubbly dough that's crust that's sort of blackened a bit

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
because they flame it.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know like the proper pizza oven thing.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But we were in like this really shitty cheek looking like plastic green and white checkerboard

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Super Mario on the walls.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Pizza basement.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Pizza basement was the name of the chain.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't think it was a chain.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think it was just like that's it.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Pizza basement on the top of the Eiffel Tower on the top of the Empire State Building.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We're in a like a tiny courtyard that was super cramped.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There was like 18,000 restaurants and there's like five meters square.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then we went down into this pizza basement and it was the best pizza I've ever had in my life.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please draw a fan out of pizza basement of the whole PCP crew.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We're having a good dinner at the pizza basement.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let me tell you a pizza story.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So in college, I majored in, I had double majored in physics and philosophy.

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I majored in pizza and pepperoni.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was a great time.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And with a minor in pepperoni studies.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But the philosophy, every department had its own like had a budget for the year, right?

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And the philosophy department just didn't do anything.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They didn't have anything to spend their funding on.

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was philosophy after all.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Because what do they do?

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So at the end of every year, the philosophy department would just go take the whole department out to like a local pizza place

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and just have a pizza party and just say, everyone eat as much pizza as you possibly can.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We need to spend our budget so that we don't get our budget reduced last year.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We need to spend it all on pizza right now.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Or we're fucked.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Buy a book, dog.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Buy a book.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Maybe they could like spend some of that money like to prank call, deliver pizzas to people they don't like.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I mean, I assume they just burned it.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Whatever we didn't, whatever we didn't spend on pizza, I assume they just flushed down the toilet the next day.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I know everyone's made this observation before, but what a silly like cost structure that like we need to waste this money.

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sure the party was fun, but.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's almost like capitalism doesn't work.

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Damn you capitalism.

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Damn.

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
By the way, I watched.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
One of the reasons I've been thinking about this was because the other day I watched like some like Buzzfeed video.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know whatever it was.

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I watched, well, first of all, I watched a Gordon Ramsay makes like a pro chef pizza, which was amazing.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then I watched this like, it was like a Buzzfeed video or something of like three tiers of chefs.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There was like some amateur fuck boy, some like mom, like with the Italian heritage or whatever.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then like a pro chef and like how each of them made their pizza.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And like, there was obviously scrub was, you know, I think I've seen videos like that.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's like, yeah, three, three different like levels making the same dish and describing their different.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It was cool and educational.

243
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And like the pizza that the pro chef made was like so advanced, like he made, he was like different brands of cheese.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He has like a whole like fucking biology like evil scientist lab where he like concocts like from like some sort of culture starter,

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
like bacteria or something that produces the dough or like the yeast or something that makes it exact.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And actually the mom did it too.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The middle level one as well.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It was pretty cool.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But like, man, there's a whole world of pizza out there.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I want to get there and get in that fancy.

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There's a series of videos on the channel called Epicurious that I kind of like and it's where they have a,

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
they have a like an expert in a certain food and then they will bring like they'll have a series of like sort of comparisons where like they'll bring in like two,

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
two samples of this different food or like something related to it, right?

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like, like ice cream, right?

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They had an ice cream expert and they have like two vanilla ice creams and they have the expert like they'll take it and like they'll look at it and they'll describe what they see and they'll smell it and stuff.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And they'll describe that and they'll taste it and they'll describe like all the differences they notice between them.

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then they'll estimate like which they think is like the more expensive and they'll do a reveal.

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And it's just really interesting to hear like, you know, they'll talk about like the processes involved in its production and like what is like,

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
what is considered like higher quality versus lower quality in each of these things and like what gives a better flavor or texture or whatever.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I like those.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
They're pretty neat.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, that's cool.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They have like a pickle guy, a coffee guy, a tea guy.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They've got a bunch.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I appreciate those.

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
By the way, total left turn.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But for some reason, speaking about these things is to be thinking about existentialism and nihilism and YouTube.

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Has anyone ever watched that one guy that Digi talks about who's the, he's like the existentialist YouTuber who talks about like how life is meaningless and pointless.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I think he has like a turtle avatar.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You know what I'm talking about?

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is that turtle worthy?

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You mean Looney Turtle?

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, that's the one.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's a blast from the past.

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
All right, you know what, never mind.

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is he the guy who Digi's been tweeting a lot?

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You know, I have Digi muted, so I couldn't tell you.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Probably.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I know Digi's a fan and I would watch it.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Whatever.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Anyway, that's the end of my pizza tirade.

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We can jump ship immediately.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
For my birthday a few months ago, I asked for like to go to a Harry Potter making of studio tour thing.

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And I didn't, they didn't have tickets until today and I just went.

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You went today?

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, it's been a few months because that was just when the tickets were available.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But Warner Brothers Studio Tour London with Harry Potter and stuff, really cool, expensive.

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But you know, it's just one of those fun things to do.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I saw Dobby, I saw Hagrid, I saw The Fibbon Forest and Aragog came from the treetops and he was a big spider on strings.

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And I went, ah!

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Was this like a theme park dark ride?

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It was like, it's like a tour, it's like a, I mean, it's their actual studio where they film things.

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So like you can walk through the great hall where they have all the things.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, the real sets are dolled up for tourists and all that.

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And yeah, there was a lot of cool stuff.

299
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They had this funny green screen thing where you sit on a broom and they film you as you're like flying around.

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you say, oh, they blow wind in your hair.

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And you're like, oh, shit, I'm being chased or whatever.

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm on a broomstick.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You should have asked them to please do that and give you the raw green screen footage so that people can like meme you onto things.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, yeah.

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They, yeah, I don't think they would have even, I'm not sure they would have even known how.

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Because the people there just push your button and then it's done and I have to go pick it up somewhere.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I have the footage.

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, can we see it?

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, maybe, maybe we can see it.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Maybe you can, I mean, it's sort of like a silly stupid thing.

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's why it's funny.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No kidding.

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But yeah, it was just, it was fun.

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I had butter beer, which is like, it tastes like root beer, but it has like clotted cream on the top, which is really nice.

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ew, that sounds good.

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's somehow good.

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Remember that candy store?

318
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I should tell the story about me buying the one pineapple gummy.

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, go.

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh, yeah.

321
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What are the points?

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Isn't that the whole story?

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In the line, that's the whole story.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In the line for the counter, they had butter beer.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I was like, ooh, butter beer.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
They, no, okay, we went into this candy store.

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We're all in this candy store and I just, I'm looking to, because I love candy stores and I love gummies.

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Gummies are like my favorite food in the world, but obviously it's not keto, so I wasn't going to get it.

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But I saw these like big, like 3D, like, like, like, they weren't just like flat shapes of a pineapple.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They were like 3D pineapple shapes and they smelled incredible.

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I was like, okay, I can eat one of these, right?

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I'm like, I'm looking around and I'm like, could I just, you know, like, you go to a grocery store,

333
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you can just like eat a grape or something off the, off a grape bunch.

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And no one, right, that episode of The Simpsons where Margie eats the grape.

335
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, and that's fine.

336
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's ethical.

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I was like, could I just do that?

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like, do I have to go through the rigmarole of buying this one pineapple gummy?

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I was like, nah, I'll do it.

340
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I guess I'll do it.

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I use the tongs and I get my one little pineapple gummy, you know,

342
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
because you get the bag and you're supposed to put your candy in the bag and they weigh it at the end.

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Right.

344
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You buy it based on weight.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So I put the one pineapple gummy in the, in the bag and I go up and I go up to the counter

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and I'm like, one, please, please, ma'am, please, charge me.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Please, sir, my keto diet can tolerate just one little gummy.

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It can tolerate only one.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And, and I don't know, the lady behind the counter was just like, um, yeah, you don't have to, you know,

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you can just have that.

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You can just have that.

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can just, she said like, she said like, um, you know, you could just ask someone who's

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
working the floor if you want a sample and like they'll give you one.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like they'll just let you have one.

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I was like, okay, cool.

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then, and then someone, one of the guys who was hanging out with us,

357
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
like I told them that that happened and they were like, oh, so we can just have,

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
so we can just have samples.

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And I was like, oh no.

360
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I was like, well, well, well, I think you're supposed to ask for,

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but he had already like grabbed like a big chunk of chocolate, like out of a, out of a,

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
out of one of the things and was like already eating it.

363
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I was like, ah, fuck.

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But anyway, that pineapple, pretty good, pretty good.

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, that's great.

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I also love gummies with a passion.

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I suspect it's genetic.

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's definitely genetic.

369
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
With his ape-like foot and grabbed a foot full of delicious candy gummies.

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He grabbed an entire fruit by the foot.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Wait.

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
An ape-like foot.

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
An ape-like foot is a hand.

374
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, I mean, he's got, he's like the beast from X-Men First Class.

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He found like a, a roller of fruit by the foot that actually can go beyond a foot

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and you just keep pulling it.

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He already like, like, you know, like a Looney Tunes style.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He'd put his mouth on a wimp.

380
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's just pulling, he's pulling it out like handkerchiefs.

381
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like a clown pulling handkerchiefs out of every nose or whatever.

382
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Indeed.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Indeed.

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wait, it was like, it was like that one shot in, I can't remember what medium this is

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
from, but I, oh, I think it was Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh, who's just staying there

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and's like, yep, no need for a scarecrow this season.

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The crows descend.

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Everything is consumed and they all rise up and it's all abandoned.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes.

390
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The entire, the entire landscape is just blanketed in crows and then like moments later they

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
fly away and the whole thing is just reduced to a barren hellscape.

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're the expert on Pooh.

393
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you remember why that happened to, to, to Rabbit?

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Cause it's funny.

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, but like, did he get rid of a scarecrow or what was the logic of the, of the scene?

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh God, it's the, oh fuck.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What, was it the one with the balloon?

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I remember, I watched this when I was doing the Pooh reviews.

399
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't think it was the episode where he's got the balloon with the balloon that he turns

400
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
into a scarecrow.

401
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's, it's shit.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, I don't remember what I, I, fuck.

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Sorry.

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe, maybe our wonderful viewers can tell us in the comments below.

405
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I got it.

406
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I want to find out.

407
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's some, someone takes, I think it's probably Tigger.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Tigger probably just fucks something up, like knocks his scarecrow over, takes his scarecrow

409
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
away or something and then just immediately just obliterated.

410
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

411
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh by the way.

413
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Not even just his garden, but like the entire earth.

414
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Is it just true?

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's a sympathy for Rabbit.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Everyone in that show is insane except for him.

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But it's, Rabbit's an asshole.

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

420
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But I'm, but I'm so sympathetic to like the asshole character surrounded by people who

421
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
like as you grow up, you realize they were the normal one all, all around, all along.

422
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's like, can you blame him for being an asshole surrounded by these mad men all 24 seven?

424
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah.

425
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I used to, when I was in high school, I was a big like Metallica fan.

426
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And like I hated Lars Ulrich because I like bought into the meme, the drummer, because

427
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
he like sued Napster and everything.

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like he came off like a, like a spoiled rock star or whatever and like a nerdy guy.

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know, the meme was that he was like the sucky one in the band.

430
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I had a shirt in high school made that was like, Jesse says the only good Lars Ulrich

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
is a dead Lars Ulrich.

432
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And there was like a picture of a pirate on it.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like to symbolize King.

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's so specific.

435
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's dope.

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That is very specific.

439
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Just recently like a conveniently you went to school with a guy named Lars Ulrich.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Unrelated.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
No connection.

442
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Lars Ulrich, the third Ulrich brother, state alchemists.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Lars Ulrich of Melnambaday.

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So just like last week, I rewatched for the first time in like 15 years, the Metallica

445
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
documentary, some kind of monster where they're like, it was, it was filmed in like 2002 when

446
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
they were trying to record the St. Anger album and they were like totally falling apart as

447
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
a band.

448
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And like James was in like rehab for a year, their basis had left.

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So they were trying to find a new basis on top of it.

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
They were all like not getting along.

451
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They had like 20 years of pent up like brother hatred for each other.

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And so like, I watched that for the first time in like, since it came out the other week,

454
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and I'm watching it and I realized Lars is the only normal fucking person in this band

455
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and he's the hero of this movie.

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And like, I didn't see that as a kid, but now like being a little older, I can see that

457
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
like, he's the only one in that movie who like wants to do their job and wants to put

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
together an album.

459
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And the rest of them are just fucking off with their therapist and like, I got to, I

460
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
can only record the album until 4pm every day.

461
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And then I got to go home to my family guys.

462
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And you know, if you guys are working on the album when I'm not here, I'll feel like

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
decisions are being made without me.

464
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And like Lars is just sitting there the whole time just like chewing his food loudly.

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Like, I thought we were a fucking rock band, you know, this is fucking bullshit.

466
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I just want to rock, you know, you guys are fucking talking all this psycho babble bullshit

467
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and it's driving me fucking crazy, man.

468
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And there's like one part where he just like yells in James' face.

469
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And it's, he's like the smallest like weakest guy.

470
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And yet he's like the only swinging dick in the fucking band left.

471
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And he's, he's my hero.

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He's a fucking, and like, there's like one part where they're like talking about Jason,

473
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the, it's like the best documentary ever.

474
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's fucking hilarious.

475
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's like, it's like, it's like real life spinal tap, but better than spinal tap,

476
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
like more ridiculous and asinine than they could even make up.

477
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh my God.

478
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This just in, Lars Ulrich has been murdered.

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The murderous final statement was, I did it for Jesse's shirt.

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He was right.

481
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The only dead Ulrich was a Lars Ulrich.

482
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sorry guys.

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I grew that shirt until my dying day.

484
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There's like in one part where like they're talking about Jason, the bassist who left

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and like, well, you know, they're all talking like, well, I think like it would hurt Jason's feelings

486
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
if we did this or if we made this decision.

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And like Lars is just listening to this, just like stewing.

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And they're like talking about Jason like, well, what's Jason gonna feel like?

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And like finally Lars just like snaps and he goes, he fucking left the band.

490
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it's like, and so like, I want that to be my new catchphrase.

491
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Whenever someone fucking, whenever I get stressed out again, without context,

492
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm just going to yell on someone's face.

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He fucking left the band!

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This fucking so pathetic, this is like sandbox shit.

495
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is like when I see my fucking, my kid argue with his friend over who gets to fucking play with a lightsaber.

496
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Seriously.

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
This is the fucking sandbox.

498
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, he's wounded.

499
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Huh?

500
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, but you know, it's up to him to mend himself and we're giving him every opportunity.

501
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
He fucking left the band!

502
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He fucking left the band!

503
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Which part of that is, hello?

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Do you know what I mean?

505
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He fucking left the band!

506
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, period!

507
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Explamation point!

508
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Which part of that is forgotten?

509
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I just, which part of that got left out of the equation?

510
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're right.

511
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The fuck did we turn into the bad guys?

512
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't understand that part.

513
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He fucking left the fucking band!

514
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Jesus Christ!

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's beautiful.

516
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There's like, and there's this, there's this one clip on, on YouTube.

517
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Everyone can look this up.

518
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Look up like Lars gets his toe crushed.

519
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Okay.

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's like, it's a scene in the movie where they're just like producing the album or whatever.

521
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And Bob Rock in his chair just like goes over, cause like Lars does not wear shoes throughout the entire movie.

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He's always just this like slovenly barefoot guy stuffing his face with food.

523
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And so like at one point Bob Rock like spins his, his wheelie chair like over his toe.

524
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And like the comedic timing from every single person in this 17 second clip.

525
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's like you could not have scripted it more hilarious.

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's just like.

527
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I found it.

528
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah.

529
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There it is.

530
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Take a look.

531
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Put it up there.

532
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We got it.

533
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Let me tell you something that we gotta fix drum-wise.

534
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Ow!

535
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't fucking ever do that again!

536
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Ever!

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't you put some fucking shoes on?

538
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Don't tell me what to do.

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You shouldn't put your foot under his wheel.

540
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Now can I show you the flaw in the drumming?

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't fucking ever do that again!

543
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Poor bastard.

544
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And then fucking Kirk's like, no, you don't put your fucking toe under his chair.

545
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You know, it's funny how just we're all, I mean, we're all just children.

546
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We're all just children who are mad that our toe got stepped on.

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And we need to cry about it to the people around us.

548
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And there's no getting out of that.

549
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We'll be that forever.

550
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Humanity needs to transcend, become pure energy to get away from shit.

551
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I just love like how...

552
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But I like this shit.

553
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, fair enough that.

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This fucking clip is like almost, it's so, like every single line like builds to a punchline.

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's like this, the most weird thing to ever be caught on.

556
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because like the first line is Bob Rock like saying like, oh, I want to show you what's wrong with your drumming here.

557
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then he's like, oh, don't fucking ever do that again!

558
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't fucking put your toe under his chair!

559
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then like the last fucking word of it is like, okay, can I tell you what's wrong with the drumming now?

560
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's like, it's like a fucking spinal tap clip or something.

561
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I've watched it millions of times and it never stops being the best thing I've ever seen.

562
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Lars Ulrich, you are my hero and I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

563
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You're the coolest guy ever.

564
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
How nice, how nice.

565
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Reminds me a little bit of Paul McCartney.

566
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And now I know nothing about the Beatles, their dynamic,

567
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but as I understand it, Paul McCartney was the most quote-unquote normal one.

568
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And also like the slave driver.

569
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah, he was a slave, not a slave driver, but like he was, he was very focused on like the work.

570
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Based Paul, you can thank him for your fucking albums, everyone.

571
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now, bow! Get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!

572
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Remember that one, everybody?

573
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I remember that.

574
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, alright, good.

575
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I remember when Paul said that.

576
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You know, I just, I would really, really, really like to meet Paul McCartney before he dies,

577
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but I don't think I'm going to get the chance.

578
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And this fills me with a little bit of sadness every day.

579
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
He's kind of, he's one of my heroes in this world.

580
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't give a fuck that he's some corporate shill asshole now.

581
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He is my fucking administrative managerial...

582
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wait, is he a corporate shill?

583
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What's this?

584
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, okay, frankly I don't know anything about him.

585
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Personally, other than he was the like slave driver of the Beatles.

586
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But that's enough.

587
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I want to meet the man who whipped these fucking asshole, crazy people into shape

588
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and made them produce art for the world to enjoy.

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because without the managers of the world, the lowly Arby's employees wouldn't be serving anybody those sandwiches,

590
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and then where would we be?

591
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He is my favorite manager in history.

592
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I know he wasn't literally the manager, but you know what I'm saying.

593
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I take some comfort from his existence, and I would really like to shake his hand one day.

594
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He's getting fucking old, so I don't know what my window is like to...

595
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, you've got to go to a Paul McCartney gig, and then you've got to jump onto the stage.

596
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's exactly true.

597
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I should do some...

598
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, that's true.

599
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I should do some amount of research into how I can meet the guy.

600
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But then on the other hand, I think to myself, like, how much effort do I really want to put into this?

601
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
These are my conflicting emotions.

602
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I mean, yeah, if it's like a casual chance to meet your hero, then it's like, oh, it's just suddenly a decision I can make.

603
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But it's like, I wouldn't really go out of my way to try and figure out how to become, like, I don't know,

604
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
to meet and become best friends with someone that I like.

605
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I just want to look at him, you know?

606
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I just want to look at his body.

607
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I want to gaze at him up and down, and I want to say to him, hey, hey, lad, remember when you go...

608
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Why would you talk to him in that accent?

609
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Because that's the only language he understands, Gabe.

610
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I've done my research.

611
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm aware of how to speak to the man.

612
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, I mean, the lad is in Liverpool.

613
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We recorded music, and then we played it, and that's about it.

614
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Tell me more, Nate.

615
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I didn't know you were there at the time.

616
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I was there, and I am him.

617
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I feel like I'm the reincarnation of Paul McCartney.

618
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That reminds me of...

619
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I saw a Wang video the other day about the fake...

620
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, God.

621
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hold on.

622
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Who's the drummer from Dream Theater?

623
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Drummer from Dream.

624
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Mike Portnoy.

625
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
For a period of several months, there was a fake Mike Portnoy going around, like, sleeping with other men,

626
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and then robbing them under the pretense, like, stealing their wallets and shit,

627
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
under the pretense that he was Mike Portnoy.

628
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And he even, like, weaseled his way into, like, industry events with, like, other actual rock stars

629
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
because he looked like Mike Portnoy and he had a really convincing...

630
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Like, he had an incredibly thorough knowledge of, like, the band's entire history and, like, touring schedule.

631
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Fascinating.

632
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, and he, like, really...

633
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He really duped him.

634
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But then, like, rock stars would be like, I knew something was off because, like, you know, I was hanging out,

635
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I was at this thing, I was at this party, like, all these other rock...

636
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Everyone was telling me, oh, yeah, Mike Portnoy's here.

637
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Like, other famous people were like, yeah, Mike Portnoy, here he is.

638
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
This is Mike Portnoy.

639
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I was like, oh, Mike Portnoy, great to meet you.

640
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, you look just like him.

641
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But then he started drumming, and he just sucked.

642
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's like...

643
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Like, what's going on here?

644
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You know, sometimes I feel like if I tried, I could maybe meet Jimmy Page or something

645
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
because... or Robert Plant.

646
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Possibly.

647
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No, because specifically my dad, his...

648
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
On his side of the family, there's a guy...

649
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes, Uncle Jeff.

650
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Uncle Jeff was like a roadie tour guide with Led Zeppelin,

651
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and he knows them personally.

652
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Right.

653
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I was, like, young when my dad explained this to him.

654
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Like, I was getting into, like, Led Zeppelin stuff,

655
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and my dad said, hey, your Uncle Jeff, you know, he toured with Led Zeppelin.

656
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He was, like, the road guy.

657
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And I was too stupid to, like, really understand what that meant,

658
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
so I never really got close to him.

659
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But, like, if I tried, I could probably, like...

660
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Like, I don't know.

661
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I could say, at least, that I'd been in a location where a guy who knows a guy was cool.

662
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah.

663
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I mean, that's kind of the other side of this.

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's like, you know, one of my heroes, Nobu Uematsu, music composer

665
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
who made, like, all the Final Fantasy music for a million years.

666
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
No, it's Uncle Phil.

667
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Excuse me, Uncle Phil.

668
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Uncle Phil?

669
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Okay.

670
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Like, in Fresh Prince?

671
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That guy.

672
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I gotta look up his name.

673
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
There was, I mean, I didn't meet Nobu Uematsu.

674
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I did meet Hiro Nobu Sakaguchi.

675
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No, sorry, not Sakaguchi.

676
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yoshaka Amano, the artist who did all, like, the logos and the early Final Fantasy art.

677
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I shook his hand with his right hand, his drawing hand, and I felt his power flow into me.

678
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
That was in a New York anime convention years and years ago when I was in college.

679
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I looked at Nobu Uematsu because I went to a distant world's Final Fantasy music concert,

680
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
again, in college, and was fucking sick.

681
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But you could have paid extra money to go backstage and, like, do, like, a meet and greet with, like, Nobu

682
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and, like, the band or, like, the conductor or whatever.

683
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So, like, that's, you know, like, yeah, you can do it if you just, like, are willing to throw money at it,

684
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
which, you know, I have someone, I guess I could do that.

685
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And then I would really want to meet Sakaguchi one day as well.

686
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And he's a younger man, so I feel like that's pretty doable.

687
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Plus, he's like, he's out there doing his Mist Walker studio stuff.

688
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's at events.

689
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
When I was at Comic-Con, there actually was an event.

690
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Sorry, not Comic-Con.

691
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Anime Expo when I went with Digi.

692
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Like, there was another thing.

693
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
If you just waited in line long enough, you got to meet Hirotomo Sakaguchi.

694
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But I was just like, fuck that.

695
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm in the building with him.

696
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That counts.

697
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So that's the one I haven't locked eyes on yet.

698
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But that's the trifecta, the Final Fantasy big dicks.

699
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I guess no more meeting him would be kind of cool.

700
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He's made some cool games.

701
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I always feel like when I imagine meeting, I have thought of like,

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
oh, what if I could meet Jimmy Page?

703
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But then it's like, who am I to him?

704
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm just some kid.

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What am I going to do?

706
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The only way meeting Jimmy Page would be cool is if I could jam with him

707
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
or musically impress him in some way, or just be really cool.

708
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What you did with Lauren Faust.

709
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Giving your card to Lauren Faust, like with your artwork on it for your comic,

710
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that was like, you know, that's like you being like,

711
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
hey, I'm not just an asshole, you know,

712
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ooh, I want to suck your dick, Lauren, like everybody else here.

713
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I mean, on the one hand, it's like, it's a power move.

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But on the other hand, she was there for a very long time,

715
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and I was the one guy who didn't pay her anything.

716
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So like...

717
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Well, I mean, I don't think she's upset about that.

718
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
She'll probably be like, oh yeah, you didn't pay.

719
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Like fuck you, like die, and she rips it in front of me,

720
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
throws it in half, throws it in my face.

721
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I mean, Lauren Faust is the person.

722
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Lauren Faust is the person who reached out to the main six guys

723
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
who were making Them's Fighting Hooves,

724
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and like offered to do of her own volition character designs

725
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
because Hasbro wasn't going to make them.

726
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Them's Fighting Hurts.

727
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, it got changed to Them's Fighting Hurts.

728
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
No, before it was Fighting His Magic.

729
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No.

730
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, it was Fighting His Magic, and then it got changed to Them's Fighting Hurts.

731
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It was never Fighting Hooves because that doesn't make any sense.

732
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, oh, Shari, oh, okay, you're right.

733
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You're right, I said the wrong thing.

734
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I wish it was Fighting His Magic became Them's Fighting Hurts.

735
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Right.

736
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So she's like, even though she made like, you know,

737
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
pony shit and is a big dick and all that,

738
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and you know, helped make Faust's imaginary friends

739
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and a bunch of other stuff, like she still has that like,

740
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't know, came from Tumblr charm, like Rebecca Sugar,

741
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
or like she has humble beginnings, you know, like many of us

742
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and can appreciate, I think, people trying to make their bones

743
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
in the industry in whatever capacity,

744
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
which is, of course, changing all the time.

745
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's online now more than like TV shows and stuff.

746
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

747
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But by the way, I was gonna say, I said before quickly

748
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that I think I'm the reincarnation of Paul McCartney, which I do.

749
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But also, you may notice Paul McCartney is not dead,

750
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but the thing about that is there was a new video this very day,

751
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
September 1st, from Kurzgesagt,

752
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
which was like an animation of a story by some nibba whose name I forget,

753
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
but it was like, it was called The Egg,

754
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and it was basically about how, it was like a story where a guy dies

755
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and he goes to meet God, and he has a chat with God about,

756
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
yeah, this is the afterlife, you're gonna get reincarnated.

757
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's what happens.

758
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And the guy's like, oh, I guess that means like Hinduism

759
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
or like Buddhism's right?

760
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And he's like, nah, it's all basically right, whatever, man.

761
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And he gets reincarnated as like a Chinese girl in like 500 AD.

762
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you send me back in time?

763
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
He's like, well, yeah, because actually what happens is

764
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
you're every person who ever existed on planet Earth,

765
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and you're gonna get reincarnated as every single person

766
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who has ever lived and will ever live on Earth.

767
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And once you're done, you will evolve to a God like me,

768
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
because actually there's other gods too on this like higher plane.

769
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
All of Earth, this entire universe,

770
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
exists as an egg for you to have these experiences to transcend

771
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and become like a God like me or something.

772
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And I was wondering, what the fuck is the point of this story?

773
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't understand what he's getting at or anything about this

774
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
because reincarnation isn't real or maybe I'm just misinformed.

775
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean, the story is about something like every story has metaphorical

776
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
like connotations in the person who's writing it.

777
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I mean, it's called the egg, right?

778
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Like just a cool uplifting thing.

779
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, like what if the end of the universe would be nice

780
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and you could, we all turn into one guy, we all returns to nothing.

781
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What if we're all one and the universe is us, man?

782
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This reminds me.

783
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I guess that I think it's an aspirational tale

784
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that maybe our existence has some greater purpose

785
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that we don't understand.

786
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That's probably true.

787
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
This reminds me of one of my favorite albums when I was in high school,

788
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Metropolis Part II by a dream theater where Mike Portnoy is from.

789
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And it really annoys me thinking about it

790
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
because it kind of seems like cool and inspirational and uplifting.

791
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And it's a story about a rock opera, I guess you could call it,

792
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
about a guy goes, he travels through the mind,

793
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
through his own memories, he discovers memories of a past life

794
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and he goes back and he solves the murder.

795
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Basically, he just remembers who killed him when he was in a past life

796
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and it solved the murder.

797
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And it's good, I guess, but it has this tone of like,

798
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
he has this big revelation, he's like,

799
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
oh my god, turns out, yes, everything's gonna be okay

800
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
because we don't disappear when we die.

801
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We all reincarnate, we will all live again, right?

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Eternity is real.

803
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And it's like, oh, that's great, it's like, wait a minute,

804
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
you just made this story up.

805
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This is all fictional evidence of this truth.

806
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
If I'm supposed to be uplifted by this revelation,

807
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
what am I then to do with the fact that, oh,

808
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
all the supposed evidence for this revelation

809
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
is just a fictional story that you wrote.

810
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
This does not uplift me, actually.

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This is just like, sure it would be nice if that were the case, shrug.

812
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
There's some things that perhaps was intended

813
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that we can take away from it.

814
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't believe in reincarnation, I don't believe in the soul,

815
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I don't believe in any of that, we're sacks of meat.

816
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But actually, I find that Metal Gear Solid 2,

817
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
a source of deep inspiration for myself

818
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
because while I wanna have kids, pass on my genetic legacy,

819
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
that's cool.

820
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But also, perhaps significantly more importantly,

821
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
it's the memes, Jack, it's the memes.

822
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Pass on those memes, bro.

823
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Passing along the ideas of ourselves to future generations,

824
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
in that sort of way, we can continue our legacy.

825
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So while reincarnation, literally not real as far as I know,

826
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
there is a semblance of immortality if we...

827
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
When Solid Snake was talking about passing on memes,

828
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
he was specifically talking about rare pepe's.

829
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, pretty much.

830
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's just this character having...

831
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
He's like, after we've gone, the spirit carries on.

832
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This character has this revelation, he's like,

833
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
yes, everything's fine because now I know that reincarnation is real.

834
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But I don't know that, I'm just depressed.

835
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I wish I'd had this revelation.

836
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I like to take a charitable interpretation of things.

837
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm gonna assume he meant the memes, Jack,

838
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
because that's the only thing that makes sense.

839
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You know, I hate this idea that reincarnation

840
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
is in any way an uplifting philosophy

841
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
because it's fucking horrifying.

842
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
No, it would be epic.

843
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
In Buddhism, the idea is that you get closer in your body.

844
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Every idea of the afterlife that people can come up with

845
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to try and make it seem less scary

846
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
is actually way more scary if you give it even a moment's thought.

847
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like, oh, okay, life goes forever

848
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
because I'm gonna be reincarnated as everyone.

849
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Sure, we're all the universe experiencing itself

850
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and we're all just one soul being reincarnated.

851
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's great, that's fine and dandy.

852
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So I'm gonna wake up and lose all my memories of being me

853
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and I'm gonna have to be some other fucking Jack off

854
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and probably get tortured to death in a fucking brazen bull

855
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
in fucking Rome in, you know, the 5th century.

856
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's great.

857
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That's a real great fucking afterlife to look forward to

858
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is being every fucking tortured, miserable ape

859
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
who ever fucking lived on this horrible planet for all time.

860
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Wow, I'm so glad I have the faith in reincarnation

861
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
to make me feel so much better about death

862
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
knowing that I get to suffer for eternity

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
as other assholes who aren't even me.

864
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Great.

865
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I just came up with a new...

866
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I mean, if you think life is just suffering

867
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
then why don't you just kill yourself?

868
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, well, I mean, life would be suffering

869
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
if I were anyone but me.

870
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay.

871
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Guys, I know this has been done before

872
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
but I just came up with a new,

873
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
My Little Pony, Frederick's Magic, OC, the brazen bull.

874
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
He's got, you know, he's brazen, he's, you know...

875
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
He's just iron will, but recolored, recolored,

876
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and given like sick Pikachu ears and turned yellow

877
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and he's, you know, the greatest character ever conceived.

878
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I just thought of like the most depressing idea

879
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
of what happens when you die

880
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
is that you don't actually stop existing.

881
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You just do your entire life in reverse

882
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
until you're a baby and then you do your life forwards again

883
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and then it just keeps going back and forth.

884
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That's just what Carl Pilkington said.

885
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
He said they need to invent.

886
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's where when you die,

887
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
you actually just age in reverse and become a baby.

888
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Is he wrong? You might not like it,

889
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
but he's spitting facts, man. These are straight facts.

890
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They really do need to get on that.

891
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
He has another like pansy-ass excuse for an afterlife

892
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that I think is lame.

893
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's when people are like,

894
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
oh man, we've got to work on like uploading our consciousness

895
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
to computers and stuff

896
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
so that we can live forever.

897
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And it's like you fucking idiots.

898
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's not living forever. It's not your consciousness.

899
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's a copy. I don't want some fucking copy of me

900
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
living on without the real me.

901
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That would piss me off even more.

902
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I would come back from the grave to kill my copy.

903
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, right?

904
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm with you. I'm with you on that.

905
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
There's no immortality for us unless we perfect our bodies

906
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
in some magical way that we won't.

907
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Play the game Soma, our gamers.

908
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
There's always the argument that like,

909
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
isn't your brain like copying itself

910
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
because the cells die and then get remade

911
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
every decade or so?

912
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I think so.

913
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's an illusion of continuity.

914
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Even if the computers are so perfect

915
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that they can perfectly replicate your brain,

916
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
isn't it you?

917
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, but then that's sort of like a cuck thing.

918
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Like I'm dying and then

919
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
my brother is going to take all of my

920
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
all of my memories, all of my relationships

921
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and he's going to have all of the good stuff

922
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and he's going to live forever and I'm going to die.

923
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
No thanks.

924
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
He's going to smash the computer.

925
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
He's going to come to life and fuck my wife, thank God.

926
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You know, I have that

927
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
existentially horrifying thought

928
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
every night just before I fall asleep

929
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
of like, what if every night we just die

930
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and then a new me with my memories wakes up in the morning?

931
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
A new version wakes up the next day.

932
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I would never know. I would just fucking die forever

933
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and I'd know it would go.

934
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That is in fact what I think is happening already

935
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and I've just accepted that

936
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm pretty comfortable with the illusion I got.

937
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Everyone just has like a 24 hour lifespan

938
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I mean, honestly, I think we have

939
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
like a quote unquote

940
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
lifespan of an infinitesimally

941
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
small slice of time and then

942
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
that next infinitesimally small slice of time

943
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
you are in fact literally a new person

944
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and this just continues.

945
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean, I think if you take the idea that your brain

946
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is copying itself to its logical conclusion

947
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
like your brain is continually

948
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in flux and like

949
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
you at any instant

950
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
is not identical to any instant

951
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
of you at any other time.

952
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I believe in the immortal soul.

953
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Not for everyone else, just for me.

954
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm the only one who has one. That's how I get through life.

955
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That idea of like

956
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
dying when you go to bed

957
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
has never resonated with me on a like

958
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
oh yet dude, I feel the same way

959
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because I've never understood

960
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
like if you believe that

961
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
then yeah, the logical

962
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
like

963
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
logical extreme or logical

964
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
follow through is that

965
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
you're a different person every time you blink

966
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
like you die and then you're a different guy

967
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
like it's so like

968
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
unimportant to anything

969
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
that you can completely forget about it. The only reason

970
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it'll freak me out but then

971
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'll have like a more pressing fear come up

972
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
yeah, there's more pressing fears like

973
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
there's a bee, there's a fucking bee

974
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
oh shit. Yeah, like yeah

975
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
like what if a spider touches me while I'm asleep

976
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and I don't know because I'm sleeping. Oh god no!

977
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What if a spider touches me and I become

978
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Spider-Man?

979
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
These questions are exactly why

980
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I made the video where I took the little

981
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
section of Casey Neistat's video

982
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
where he just says, he gets a question

983
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
what's the meaning of life and he just says

984
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
existentialism is a dangerous thing

985
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
like stop thinking about it

986
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and get back to work. Yeah.

987
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because where are we going with this?

988
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Are you like doing deep...

989
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
if you're like a researcher

990
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
but that's implied in the work, if you're actually making

991
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
meaningful strides on the question

992
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
then great, keep doing so. But if you're just some asshole

993
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
who can't get to sleep

994
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that's a creepy, weird

995
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
utilitarian answer.

996
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I think it's perfectly logical. Casey Neistat

997
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
creeps me out. He's got a weird

998
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
face. He looks like a rat man.

999
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
He is the rat man.

1000
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But I feel like

1001
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I've listened to this

1002
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
talk multiple times.

1003
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's a John Cleese talk where he talks about

1004
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
what was it? The...

1005
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Creativity? Yeah, he talks about creativity.

1006
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I can't remember the terms. Dude, I watched that again

1007
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
last week to get myself

1008
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
to fucking sort myself out

1009
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and get myself working on Vapors again

1010
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
which I did and I have scripts written now.

1011
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It talks about

1012
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
having the playful

1013
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
mode

1014
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and then the serious mode.

1015
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You need both. You can't always be

1016
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
utilitarian because

1017
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
then you'll never think of anything interesting

1018
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
or come to good solutions to problems

1019
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and you'll just live your life

1020
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
doing the same thing every day.

1021
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And you can't be thinking

1022
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
like pondering

1023
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and being creative all the time because then

1024
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
you'll get into existential dread and then

1025
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
you'll come up with ideas and just wallow

1026
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
wallow in your

1027
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
fucking big mean

1028
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
thoughts that you're having. So you've got

1029
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
to cordon them off so that they're separate

1030
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and figure out how to get into

1031
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
one and then get out of it

1032
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and then get into the other one. Makes sense.

1033
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And it's

1034
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
very important to have both.

1035
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
You know what Casey Neistat looks like?

1036
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
He looks like a wet koala.

1037
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You know, he does swim quite a lot.

1038
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
He's always jumping in pools.

1039
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's true.

1040
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Even when he's not wet, I mean

1041
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
the shape of his face is like a wet face.

1042
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He does look like

1043
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
a goblin. He's definitely

1044
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
some sort of ghoul or ghast from

1045
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
the grave.

1046
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I just want to shame

1047
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Casey Neistat now. I just want to be a

1048
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
shit commenter. You know what?

1049
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I've really

1050
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I need to apologize to everyone

1051
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
ever because I've

1052
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
discovered the joys of being a shit

1053
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
commenter. And it's completely

1054
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
turned my life around.

1055
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Because

1056
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't know how it happened. I think I got subscribed

1057
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
to some channel by accident.

1058
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Some like

1059
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
fucking screen rant or something.

1060
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
This is like these inane

1061
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
theories about movies that are like

1062
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
clearly not the intention. It's just fucking filling

1063
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
the air with vapid noise

1064
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
to fucking, you know, get their clip quotas.

1065
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's all stuff like fucking like

1066
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
what if Rick is secretly Morty?

1067
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What if

1068
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Luke is a ghost the whole

1069
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
time in the movie and not just

1070
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
at the end?

1071
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That would mean he's his own grandpa

1072
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
like that song. Also like Futurama.

1073
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What if Rick

1074
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and Morty, Star Wars, Stranger

1075
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Things, Squarespace,

1076
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
NordVPN guys

1077
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Why and why is there a stop sign

1078
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
in the Aladdin Sega Genesis game?

1079
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And like

1080
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
time paradox. Every time that one of

1081
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
these comes up in my feed, I click

1082
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
on it and I watch like the first two

1083
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
seconds of it and I just have this

1084
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
overwhelming like this cathartic

1085
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
need to just type like

1086
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
you make me want to kill myself

1087
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
with these fucking just the titles of these videos

1088
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
alone make me want to fucking die

1089
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
stop it kill yourself stop die

1090
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
die die die like I get it now

1091
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
like I totally get it I've just become

1092
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
a shit commenter and I'm embracing it

1093
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I mean I definitely understand that as well

1094
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
like it's not even that

1095
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
you want them to understand you just want to say

1096
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
shit bad because you want them to see

1097
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that someone didn't like it yeah

1098
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
like I know I know I subscribed

1099
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
to it I guess you could

1100
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
say it's my fault but like even if I wasn't

1101
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
subscribed to it it would still exist and so

1102
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
it would still be a problem yeah that's why I feel like I

1103
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
have to be subscribed I have to be the watcher on the

1104
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
wall to see these fucking videos come

1105
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
up so I can just see them and know that

1106
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
they exist and that this is the bad

1107
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that exists in the world I have to always

1108
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
be aware that the world is a bad place

1109
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
because what if Rick and Morty

1110
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Stranger Things 11

1111
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Star Wars what if they were all the same

1112
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
guy nor

1113
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
VPN guys you know unfortunately

1114
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
the commenters are mostly

1115
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
like I disagree for some

1116
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
very specific lore reason not

1117
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
you know what you're doing here is damaging

1118
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the human race and the human experience you know those

1119
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
comments the comments that try

1120
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to be constructive on those types

1121
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
of completely terrible videos like you know

1122
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
they'll never learn that they're doing

1123
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
this because it yeah they're not made to be

1124
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
good try stop trying to be constructive

1125
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
they don't care I would love if there was

1126
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
like a like a guy

1127
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
like literally a watcher on the wall who

1128
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
just goes on every bad video

1129
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and types video bad if it's

1130
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
bad and then he like becomes

1131
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
like a like a like everyone

1132
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
like that one guy Justin why or whatever

1133
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
who's on every yeah so someone like that who

1134
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
becomes infamous for like making

1135
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
making it like labeling the videos

1136
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
as bad and then

1137
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
people just suddenly you know you get

1138
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
million upvotes we should make an account

1139
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
eventually there will be a million

1140
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
eventually there will be a million accounts of that

1141
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
it'll be like a movement of all of our watchers

1142
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
on the wall you know protecting the

1143
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
internet let's make a fucking

1144
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
let's make a fucking account on the pcb

1145
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
called commenter on the wall with like a certain

1146
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
icon and make that icon like

1147
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
a link to that picture in the description

1148
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of that channel or whatever so everyone

1149
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
can go download it and make a channel exactly

1150
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
the same way and we can all be the commenter

1151
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
on the wall except once you make it everybody

1152
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
the pcp is now officially

1153
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
pro bad comments

1154
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
finally

1155
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
thank god did you isn't here to fight back

1156
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
this is the arc of the whole show we've done it

1157
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
we've done a heal turn full circle

1158
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
or is this full circle

1159
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
we went from the heal to the hero like a

1160
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
double baby face turn

1161
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we're a bad baby right now

1162
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
we're a bad dragon

1163
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
god fucking screen rent you know

1164
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I think I subscribed to this because I think it's

1165
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
the channel

1166
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
there's this one guy on this channel

1167
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
or some channel like it that does like

1168
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
these like movie

1169
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
pitch meeting videos that are like sort of

1170
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
popular there's like 500 of them

1171
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
they're all the exact same video but they're kind

1172
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
of funny okay you know it's like

1173
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
they all start the same it's

1174
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
like a guy pitching a movie to like another guy

1175
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
played by himself they start the same

1176
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
they end the same but there's like little jokes

1177
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and like observations about the movie they're kind of like

1178
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
little like reviews but like

1179
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
done in a unique way you got a link to

1180
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
any of them yeah I mean just type in

1181
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
pitch meeting you'll find a thousand of them okay

1182
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
so like I got into that guy

1183
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and it was you know I watched like a

1184
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
bunch of them and they're really funny and they're really

1185
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
cool I like the guy but like I started

1186
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
to notice like an insidious

1187
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
thing creeping into the videos

1188
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
which is like

1189
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
um catchphrase creep

1190
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
it's it that's my new fucking term for

1191
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
a thing that I hate because like

1192
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
man nice catchphrase

1193
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
yeah it started off

1194
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
you know it like the beginnings are the same

1195
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and the ends are the same but everything in the middle

1196
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
was unique but over time

1197
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
he would say things that commenters would say

1198
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I like the way you said that so he'd like keep

1199
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
saying it so like he keeps

1200
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
he keeps gaining more and more catchphrases

1201
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
every couple of months okay

1202
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
so like and one of them he must have said

1203
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
like hey this will be super easy

1204
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
barely an inconvenience so then that

1205
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
became a catchphrase so he works that joke

1206
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
into every video and then the one he has

1207
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
the other guy go like oh

1208
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
thing is tight this is tight

1209
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and then that became a catchphrase and now that's

1210
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
what they tell you to do and like the youtube

1211
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
like god I'm sure it is

1212
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
YouTube Academy or whatever it's like it's like

1213
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
create little in jokes with your audience

1214
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
or whatever yeah so then that's too

1215
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and then recently he started going oh I

1216
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
need you to get all the way off my back

1217
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
about this and then that became a catchphrase

1218
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
so now like it's just like it's at a point now

1219
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
where he's at like critical mass where

1220
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
every fucking line in the videos is a

1221
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
catchphrase they are they've become completely

1222
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
about to collapse into a catchphrase black hole

1223
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
yeah he's like he's slowly

1224
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
he's draining himself

1225
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
of all of his creativity and all

1226
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
of his like observational humor

1227
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
it's all just being replaced slowly

1228
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
by catchphrases and now the entire video

1229
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
is just

1230
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
oh that thing is tight I need to get all

1231
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
the way off my back about this super easy

1232
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
barely an inconvenience

1233
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and everyone in the comments just types

1234
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the thing he said again like oh

1235
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
he said that thing again

1236
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
like the videos are just like ruined

1237
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
now it's just like

1238
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
the insidious cancer of

1239
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
catchphrases creeping into everything

1240
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
even remotely interesting or unique

1241
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and ruining it I could see that

1242
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
ah youtube

1243
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
fucking youtube man I can't

1244
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
take it anymore these these thumbnails

1245
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
alone I'm noticing a pattern of they just take

1246
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
a picture and make the eyes really big

1247
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and also the mouth sometimes that's I mean

1248
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that's just loving that that's like

1249
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that's like a gaming the algorithm

1250
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
taken to its logical extreme

1251
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
you got the title season 8

1252
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
you make the face as big as possible

1253
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
big eyes because big eyes are endearing

1254
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
or whatever and eventually they will

1255
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
all just be the exact same script

1256
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
he won't even be talking just like changing

1257
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
the name of the movie and the exact same

1258
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
video

1259
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
all the way up my back

1260
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
yeah

1261
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I want to see youtube thumbnails

1262
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
go to the point where it's like

1263
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
it's just

1264
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
just a big face

1265
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
but photoshopped to be grotesque

1266
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and then with a like a color

1267
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in the background and then a one

1268
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and then for the youtube that's the first

1269
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
video yeah then the it's the exact same

1270
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
face but with a two

1271
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
in a different color and then they just

1272
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
do that forever

1273
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
that sounds great it sounds like

1274
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
right right now it sounds like the

1275
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
present I have ideas like to just

1276
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
people and you like you know like

1277
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
totally like off the wall

1278
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
fucking like to just make like make a

1279
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
real video like a long

1280
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
an actual sincere

1281
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
think piece on something and have it like

1282
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
be like a real video but just make the

1283
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
thumbnail like literally a picture of a

1284
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
guy's thumbnail and like not

1285
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
explain it at all there's got to be

1286
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
yeah I mean that would probably just

1287
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
get you views and then people stick

1288
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
around because it was a good video

1289
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
probably probably god

1290
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I hate that that would probably work

1291
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
or just like or just name it like fucking

1292
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
youtube video and just

1293
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
like it it's like a real video about a

1294
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
real thing but you wouldn't know it because it just says youtube

1295
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
video and it's a picture of a guy's thumb

1296
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and then you click on it and it's like a fucking

1297
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
like a five hour is it a thumbs

1298
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
up reminding me to like subscribe

1299
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and click up no just just a guy

1300
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
we maybe he's got like a hang nail like

1301
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
hanging off his thumb so you really

1302
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
get that if this is a fucking thumbnail

1303
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
but I guarantee I mean because I'm doing it

1304
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
right now I'm speculating about the deeper

1305
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
meaning of this thumbnail even though the whole

1306
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
concept is that it has no deeper meaning

1307
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but I would you know what they might as well

1308
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
just be honest and have every single thumbnail

1309
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
for every single video from now on be a

1310
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
picture of like the logo for Squarespace

1311
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
or Nord VPN or Harry's

1312
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Razors or some fucking stupid

1313
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
shit like that that they have to fucking

1314
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I've seen videos where like they say it

1315
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
three times in one video like at the beginning

1316
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
the middle and the end or

1317
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and like the same one too

1318
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm so sick of it

1319
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
these fucking I don't I don't blame them

1320
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
for this but I do hate it and like

1321
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
look at this next one I just look at the thumbnail

1322
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm not looking at this video but it's I know Captain

1323
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Midnight's Game of Thrones Game of Thrones season 8

1324
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
is a train wreck it's just big Tyrion

1325
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
solid color big words

1326
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I mean I don't have any better

1327
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
ideas for a thumbnail but

1328
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
does this not just strike something

1329
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
deep inside like oh it's just

1330
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
homogenized like they all are going to

1331
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
look like that eventually okay

1332
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
okay so my the

1333
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Sonichu lecture has been getting more views

1334
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
than than than usual

1335
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
lately and I was considering

1336
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
if maybe alright so the thumbnail is like

1337
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
it's my face Sonichu

1338
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and my logo

1339
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
right and I was wondering if

1340
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
maybe it would be like more clickable

1341
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
maybe it would be better if I changed it

1342
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
it's like having my logo there doesn't really add

1343
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
to clickability it's just there because there was space

1344
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
like what if I

1345
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
just put like a big big bold text

1346
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
that said like Sonichu 101 or something

1347
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
like I feel like that might be more

1348
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I mean that would definitely be a good idea

1349
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I think to get more people

1350
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
clicking it seems like

1351
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I mean I think generally it's better to have

1352
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
the thumbnail be more about the thing than

1353
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
about you because nobody cares about that

1354
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that's just sort of the problem isn't it

1355
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
if everyone's becoming homogenous then

1356
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
you you will retain no viewers

1357
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
like people will come and view it

1358
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
but nobody will subscribe because it's all

1359
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
everyone's all the same

1360
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that's also true

1361
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I wouldn't take my face off there

1362
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I would just maybe cover the logo because I don't know if the logo really

1363
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
accomplishes anything

1364
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and I feel like text is

1365
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I mean the logo is a brand and it's you

1366
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't know why would you get rid of it

1367
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
if you don't need to

1368
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
you know it's like the

1369
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
eternal curse of my

1370
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
stolen by everyone in the fucking world

1371
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
like updates video right which has been

1372
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
uploaded to Facebook pages

1373
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
thousands of YouTube channels usually with

1374
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
you know with my name taken off sometimes with the whole

1375
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
entire punchline cut out for some

1376
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
fucking reason you know always in like

1377
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
240p you know terrible fucking

1378
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
quality you know when my

1379
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
fucking original version is still up there

1380
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and like on

1381
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
YouTube now there's an option I found out

1382
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
we can click and see like all the people who

1383
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
have been content match to your

1384
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
video really a big list

1385
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and I clicked on that the other day and just like

1386
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it was just an endless wall

1387
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
of my video uploaded by

1388
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
like thousands of channels

1389
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
over and over again and

1390
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
so many of them have

1391
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
like higher view counts than my

1392
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
original video and the reason they

1393
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
have higher view counts is because the original

1394
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
video has a real name and

1395
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
a real thumbnail that no one fucking cares

1396
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
about and all the fucking reuploads

1397
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and stolen versions are called like

1398
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
man man at windows

1399
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
10 wow windows 10 updates

1400
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
really bad frowny face

1401
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and it's just like a man

1402
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
n-word video mad

1403
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Obama fuck you Obama

1404
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
in all caps like totally ruining the

1405
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
joke yeah like sucking all the humor

1406
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
out of it yeah because these fucking people

1407
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
don't understand humor and don't understand

1408
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
the fucking comedy of the video

1409
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
so they just want to suck it out completely

1410
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
with their inane fucking titles

1411
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that ruin it but those are the

1412
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
titles that people click on this is a fascinating

1413
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
concept no thumbnail just up just

1414
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
the image from the video that's what people are clicking

1415
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
on just inane fucking bullshit and

1416
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
meanwhile the original my comedy

1417
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that only exists because of me because

1418
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I am funny because I am a fucking

1419
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
improvisational god damn comedy

1420
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
mastermind you know yeah

1421
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm getting I should be I should

1422
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
literally be a millionaire from

1423
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
that video alone because it has been seen and clicked

1424
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
on billions of times

1425
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
but it's all just everybody else's

1426
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
bullshit clickbait versions of it

1427
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and not the original and I've made

1428
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
fucking nothing off of it can't

1429
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you on in that list of things

1430
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
can you not like try to claim

1431
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
uh add revenue from

1432
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
them or something

1433
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
yeah you can't know you can you can

1434
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
claim them and you can take it down

1435
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and like in the beginning

1436
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
when I first saw people stealing

1437
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
it everywhere I would do that I would take it down

1438
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
but they just fucking beat me down

1439
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
they wore me down because it was too much to keep

1440
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
up with you cannot keep taking

1441
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
them down it's is it just an endless

1442
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
ocean of it so I just gave up after

1443
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
a while like fuck okay

1444
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
you win internet it belongs to everyone

1445
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I guess you've taken my art

1446
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and you've taken my comedy and you've sucked

1447
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
all the fucking life out of it you sucked

1448
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
all the joy and fun out of it and you can

1449
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
just have it now congratulations

1450
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
you took something funny and you fucking ruined

1451
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
it good job people

1452
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
of earth let's not forget I mean this

1453
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
video is one minute and

1454
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
48 seconds long if there's not

1455
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
that much to like clip out and

1456
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
you know make it so like if you had like

1457
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I get why people take hour-long

1458
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
podcasts and cut like five-minute

1459
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
sections I mean guys like Joe Rogan do this

1460
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
and they but they have a channel where they

1461
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
upload their own highlights which seems

1462
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
like the reasonable we have one too on the

1463
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
PCB very rarely used it seems

1464
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
reasonable like I I don't

1465
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't find it crazy for other people to

1466
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
upload like I did with Casey Neistat

1467
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
took like a long video took five seconds

1468
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
and look I I pretty sure I did

1469
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
monetize it but if he objected I

1470
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
whatever man that's on him but

1471
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I feel the context is different

1472
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
this is a very short video

1473
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
and I have no moral objection to anyone

1474
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
like like

1475
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
demanding ownership of their property in this

1476
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
way and I feel it too my my galco

1477
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
video was uploaded a million other places

1478
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I have not looked into this tool to see how

1479
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
many content IDs it be I'd be very curious

1480
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
to do so but

1481
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
yeah I feel I feel like it's kind of like

1482
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
places like the New York Times

1483
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
have like investigative journalism

1484
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
and they actually sent out reporters like

1485
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
you know really do news work

1486
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm not defying them I'm just saying this is a fact

1487
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and then like all these

1488
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
outlets across the entire fucking world

1489
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
they like you know reference the article

1490
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
they clip it they capture some piece of it

1491
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and they say and we're reporting what's

1492
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
New York Times reported this what's wrong

1493
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
with the New York Times

1494
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
well I have no feelings one way

1495
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
or another but like there's

1496
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
it's just that they are doing the groundwork

1497
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and the people are profiting

1498
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
off their work and I don't know

1499
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
maybe there's some sighting going on I doubt

1500
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I don't know why you had to clarify I'm not

1501
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm saying they do real news

1502
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
but I'm not defending them Ben the point is who cares

1503
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I don't care the point is

1504
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that people are profiting off other people's work

1505
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and I like is this

1506
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
just the natural progression of the internet

1507
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
feels kind of shitty when people can just take

1508
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
your stuff I mean it makes me feel like

1509
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
if you can't beat them join them like I might as well

1510
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
make a bunch of dummy accounts and upload

1511
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
my own video with a bunch of stupid clickbait titles

1512
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
it's like and reap all that

1513
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
you know I might as well just like change

1514
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
the title to something more clickbaity anyway

1515
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
since everyone else is going to fucking reap the profits

1516
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
off my shit by doing that anyways

1517
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it's you know and they all fucking just

1518
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
they just ruin it because people are so fucking

1519
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
ignorant and they just like

1520
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
this like death of the author shit of everyone

1521
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
trying to like title it whatever they want

1522
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and change the fucking point of the video

1523
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
where they call it like Windows 10 rant

1524
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it's not Windows 10

1525
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
every fucking comment every fucking person

1526
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
who uploads it man mad at

1527
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Windows 10 because they can't fucking

1528
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
fathom that every operating

1529
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
system does this you know it's

1530
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Windows 8 in the video that's what I'm using

1531
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I didn't fuck you know but

1532
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
it's just like oh Windows

1533
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
something about that just fucking annoys the shit out of me

1534
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
that they're just ignorant and wrong about it

1535
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
in such a small way but it drives me fucking

1536
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
crazy and then like the other

1537
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
thing is when they like they put the punchline

1538
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
in the title like Obama

1539
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
you nigger and it's like

1540
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
mm-hmm yeah that's not the

1541
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
fucking like that's not the funny part

1542
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
the funny part is that it builds to that

1543
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
because I'm angry and angrier

1544
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and angrier and then I say something offensive

1545
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and then the punchline is saying

1546
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I'm a racist you made me a racist

1547
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
it's that's the shame of it the punchline

1548
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
is saving it with my

1549
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
shame you know

1550
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and I if it just

1551
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
ended on the n-word I wouldn't have

1552
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
ever uploaded it because that's not fucking funny

1553
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it's just fucking weird and racist

1554
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
mm-hmm you made me a racist

1555
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
is the funny part and people I've seen that

1556
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I've seen it uploaded with like that part

1557
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
cut out or like with the n-word

1558
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
censored which just ruins it

1559
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
it makes it not funny they

1560
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
they just take it and they fucking they think they

1561
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
can dittle with it because they think it's community

1562
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
property and they can just fiddle with my comedy

1563
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and make it less funny

1564
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
that's what defense me the most is just

1565
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
making it less funny because

1566
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
no one is funny no one gets

1567
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
anything I think the problem is

1568
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
some things I think qualify

1569
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
for people to fiddle around with in some ways

1570
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know I'm happy to take

1571
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
pieces of things and like edit them together

1572
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
in funny ways or whatever

1573
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
but but where's the line I mean I there is

1574
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
no I mean it's clear that the

1575
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
they just want to profit off of the funny

1576
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
video yeah they're not trying

1577
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
they're not trying to do anything creative

1578
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
well yeah I mean in this case I agree

1579
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
they just want money from not doing

1580
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
the work but I mean people just give

1581
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
themselves license

1582
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't know there's no

1583
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
when I feel the same way there's just no

1584
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
when you're fucking when you are

1585
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
a creative actually making your

1586
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
own shit you lose and

1587
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
for the rest of your life that's the moral

1588
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
it's like you okay

1589
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
tons of the profit will be siphoned away and taken by

1590
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
other people but like you know you can still

1591
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
theoretically earn some

1592
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
revenue on your own are you willing

1593
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to do that so that the world

1594
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
can profit so much beyond what you've

1595
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
done with your work I mean that's a

1596
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
question everybody has to make for themselves

1597
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
or that's to answer for themselves when

1598
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
they decide to do this because that's what's going to happen

1599
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and frankly like I

1600
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm not like I do

1601
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
have some self-awareness of the fact that

1602
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
like okay I guess

1603
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
this video makes me

1604
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
a nigger guy forever

1605
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
like I get like

1606
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm not exactly happy

1607
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
that the most viewed video

1608
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
on my channel on the front page

1609
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
is forever going to be a fuck

1610
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
updates but at the same time

1611
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
not bats oh wait that's on the other channel right

1612
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
yeah but at the same time I don't want to take it down

1613
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
either because it has to be up so that people can

1614
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
know where the original is because it's been everywhere

1615
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
so it's like

1616
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
this weird mode where I'm like

1617
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
normally if it had just been like a video

1618
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
that got 10,000 views or whatever

1619
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
you know eventually I might have been like okay

1620
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
this is an old fucking video

1621
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
it's fucking I'm embarrassed by it now

1622
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
you know unlisted or something

1623
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
so now it's like I'm simultaneously

1624
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm embarrassed

1625
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
enough about it but also proud enough

1626
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
about it that it can never be taken down

1627
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I know what you mean I know what you mean

1628
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
my lolly is the greatest love of all

1629
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
video yeah I don't even think it's like an amazing

1630
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
video but like I'm not just going to take

1631
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
it down because because because what

1632
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
like yeah like I know someday

1633
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
someone is going to try to ruin

1634
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
my whole life and career and because oh he's

1635
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
called Obama the n-word

1636
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
in fucking 2010 in a windows

1637
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
ranch or something but like I mean

1638
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
yeah okay it's a little embarrassing

1639
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I take it down but you know what

1640
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
it's also funny and it's also

1641
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
mine and the principle of the matter is

1642
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that it's mine and so

1643
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I can't take it down because

1644
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
all you motherfuckers are going to steal it

1645
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I mean I find it enough to be yeah

1646
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
there could be a social cost to pay perhaps

1647
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
but like it's a joke I'm caught between an n-word

1648
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and a hard place

1649
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
it's a joke I feel the same

1650
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
about my video it's a joke I mean what

1651
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
what's the issue here

1652
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I don't know

1653
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I just hope everyone dies

1654
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is the point of all my stories

1655
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
now that's something we can all get behind

1656
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I have another story but if anybody else

1657
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
wants to bring up anything feel free

1658
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
well I I fucking

1659
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
smashed the fasc yesterday

1660
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
oh yeah tell us

1661
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I went to the straight pride rally

1662
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
to protest oh yes I saw you attending

1663
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
the the straight pride rally

1664
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
and we won

1665
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and we won and I got a little pepper spray

1666
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
in my in my mouth

1667
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
did you get pepper did someone pepper spray you

1668
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
they I mean they didn't pepper spray me

1669
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I was near someone who got pepper spray

1670
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and it you know dissipated into the air

1671
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and I breathed some of it you know who was

1672
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
doing that and it was epic

1673
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
the police yeah yeah

1674
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
oh okay I thought the oh yeah yeah it was the police

1675
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I see I see all right well I guess

1676
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I can give like a rundown sure so we

1677
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
we like um

1678
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
also munchie and Kazi showed up briefly

1679
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
that's cool all right at the end

1680
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
because they were just in the area and they just came

1681
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
to hang out um so we met up

1682
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
at and the Boston Common

1683
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
which is like close to where the parade was

1684
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
by the way uh so the deal

1685
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
with this thing is that it was like the

1686
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
lowest effort like weakest trolling

1687
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
attempt by the alt right

1688
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
or whatever it was just

1689
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
a just like a mean spirited

1690
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
you know parody of a

1691
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
gay pride parade and they didn't even try

1692
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
they rented one float they were like

1693
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
200 guys tops

1694
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
that showed up for them we outnumbered them

1695
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
like 10 to 1 uh

1696
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
literally epic so so you you're saying

1697
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
this is a shitposting attempt basically

1698
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
that was the thrust this is this is this is

1699
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
a shitposting attempt and I'm kind

1700
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
of and I'm mad and I'm mad that they got a

1701
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
permit for it because it's so

1702
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
stupid and it was so

1703
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
like lazily done and poorly thought out

1704
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and just such an obviously bad

1705
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
event like I wouldn't care

1706
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
what was the float the float just said

1707
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Trump 2020 uh so

1708
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
it didn't even have anything to do with being straight

1709
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
now you see you know you know

1710
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
stupid here's the thing I think the straight

1711
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
pride parade could be really funny

1712
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
if someone who was funny did it

1713
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
they could make it in a really funny way

1714
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
um like

1715
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't know like making

1716
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
floats that are just like make that are

1717
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
like making jokes about like being

1718
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
vanilla or something like maybe a float

1719
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
that's just like a loaf of white bread

1720
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
or something or I don't know

1721
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
something something like you know that's

1722
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
someone else could have a better idea but just like

1723
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
you could do like a satirical way and it would be funny

1724
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and maybe I would like it but this was

1725
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
just boring and just uh just

1726
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
you know just mean spirit and bad

1727
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
so like I don't think they should have got a

1728
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
permit I'm annoyed that they got a permit I'm

1729
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
annoyed that the police showed up to like

1730
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
such stalwart defense for this stupid

1731
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
event I'm just curious

1732
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
why do you say it was mean spirited

1733
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
why do I say it was mean spirited

1734
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
yes what

1735
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
how could it be anything else

1736
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
okay gotcha

1737
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
like like

1738
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
no I mean that like I believe you

1739
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
like the the the

1740
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
you're like it's

1741
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
how do I even put it how do I even put into words

1742
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
um like

1743
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
straight people don't need a pride parade straight people

1744
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
are not are not oppressed they claim like the

1745
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
people organizing a claim to be the oppressed

1746
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
majority which is like

1747
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
like they can't possibly really believe

1748
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
that I agree this is just this is

1749
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
this is the this is the like oh they

1750
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
it's a it's a it's a spite parade

1751
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
it is yes it is a spite it was a spite

1752
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
right but anyway we all met up at the

1753
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
at the commons and you know we fucked around

1754
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
we all got along on the streets we waited for

1755
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
the parade to start there were so many cops

1756
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
there were so many fucking cops

1757
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
out they were like riding down the

1758
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
street on their motorcycles and like blaring

1759
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
their sirens even though nothing was happening

1760
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
just to like I don't know

1761
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
subdue of the crowd or something with like

1762
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
ear damaging levels of noise

1763
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
um they did all that

1764
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the parade started it lasted like a minute

1765
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
because there were like 200 guys in one float

1766
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and like one car

1767
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
um we followed they had like oh

1768
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Milo Yiannopoulos was there he was on the float

1769
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I see he was

1770
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
he was wearing a MAGA hat blowing kisses to

1771
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
the crowd so a gay man was

1772
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
on the float of a straight pride parade

1773
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
well not just any gay man

1774
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
the gay man

1775
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
yeah yeah

1776
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
patient zero

1777
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
for gayness

1778
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
the origin of the virus

1779
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I saw him up there

1780
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and then we all kind of just gathered around

1781
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
they had a police barricade

1782
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
so many fucking cops they had a police

1783
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
barricade they did it in like the city hall

1784
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
plaza we couldn't hear them

1785
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
they were they had like there was a

1786
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
stage and there were speakers but like

1787
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
we could not hear what they were actually saying

1788
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and we just like hung around for the whole thing

1789
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
just booed them a whole lot

1790
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
you know chanted

1791
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
that they suck and should go home

1792
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
um and uh you know

1793
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
it's pretty good and then

1794
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
how little do you have to accomplish in life

1795
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
if you have to be proud of being straight

1796
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
that's right

1797
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
right it's really there's really no

1798
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
there's really no need there's really no need for this

1799
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
like yeah either it's

1800
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you know as it seems

1801
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
a big shitpost spite parade

1802
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
or it's incredibly pathetic and should be

1803
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
mocked anyway

1804
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I think it was mostly the latter

1805
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and maybe a few people in there

1806
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
are the former

1807
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I mean Milo known provocateur

1808
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I mean I don't know how people feel about him

1809
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
these days haven't heard much about him lately

1810
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
but I know he's trying to make people mad

1811
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I think that probably some of the people were

1812
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
just like sincerely like

1813
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I do feel persecuted for being straight

1814
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and those that's just even sadder

1815
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
that's even sadder to me

1816
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
boy I was in that float

1817
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
for me boys

1818
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I mean this is just like that

1819
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
that that thing the the flyers that were going

1820
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
up okay like technically true

1821
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
okay technically it's fine to be

1822
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
proud or whatever of being straight okay like

1823
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
those posters that we're saying it's okay to be

1824
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
white okay yes technically we all understand

1825
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
it's technically fine it is okay

1826
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
to be white but you know it's it's

1827
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
clearly in response but we don't need we don't need

1828
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
to fucking march about it yeah don't you have your

1829
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
whiteness in my face I'm doing just fine folks

fucking house that's the fucking

1833
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
solution

1834
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
you don't need to fucking go out on the streets

1835
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and be annoying and show everyone what a

1836
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000

1839
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
you know anyone fucking picketing

1840
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
or making a fucking public disturbance

1841
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
for any reason anyone going outside

1842
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
going hey look at me I'm this fucking

1843
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
group you're all fucking losers just

1844
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
stay inside and stop bothering normal

1845
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
people frankly if you're not

1846
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
making pipe bombs I question your dedication

1847
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
to the cops I unironically

1848
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
believe that if you don't have the courage

1849
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
to fight kill and die for your beliefs

1850
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and fuck your beliefs

1851
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
fuck your group fuck your parades

1852
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
there enough bunch of fucking losers

1853
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
yeah so there were 34

1854
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
arrests I saw maybe like

1855
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
maybe like 10 of them okay

1856
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and I didn't see what any of them were getting

1857
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
arrested for I just saw people being like

1858
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
you know like taken away and like

1859
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
escorted I saw one guy

1860
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
he was being like four cops

1861
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
each one was like grabbing one of his

1862
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
like arms and legs and just like carrying

1863
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
him like like down the street

1864
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I don't know what he did to get it I didn't

1865
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
see it actually take place I just saw them

1866
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
carrying him away it was quite a spectacle

1867
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the one thing okay at the end

1868
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
after like the rally was over

1869
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
you know we all yell and go home and whatever

1870
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
the rally was over they're all dissipating

1871
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
that's what I would

1872
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and for some reason people kept

1873
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
hanging out and they just

1874
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
they didn't leave like the crowd didn't leave

1875
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
for a while they were still just sort of like waiting

1876
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
around the barricade

1877
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and at this point like the police come in

1878
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and they do like a police thing like they're clearing the street

1879
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
they're clearing the street and some people did

1880
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
not get out of the street and clear the way

1881
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
for the police and this is what I this is

1882
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
when there was pepper spray employed

1883
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
they just like people wouldn't clear the road

1884
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
for this police envoy or whatever and

1885
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
they just they had they had to spray him

1886
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and it's it got kind of dicey for a second

1887
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
it seemed like it seemed like

1888
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
the crowd all had to like push back from the

1889
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
street and like it looked like

1890
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
there was like a brawl breaking out and like it

1891
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
looked for a minute like there was just going to be like

1892
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
fighting like breaking out in the sidewalk

1893
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
have you ever seen like I don't I don't know how much

1894
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
of this you've ever been to like a big like

1895
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
potential fighty kind of thing I've never been

1896
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
in fucking a situation like that in my whole life

1897
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
one of probably the closest thing

1898
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I've been to but but I didn't actually

1899
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
see the pepper spraying because there was a crowd

1900
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
but I did I did you know like I heard

1901
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
people saying they're spraying they're spraying

1902
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
and then I like breathe something

1903
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
in and I was like my throat

1904
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000

1906
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
to die but it was fine

1907
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
it wasn't a big it wasn't a big deal

1908
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and then but some some guy

1915
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
and like I was breathing through that for a second

1916
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000

1917
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000

helped breathe this you know

1921
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
bash the bash and that's

1922
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
that's all there is to it bash the bash

1923
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't know by that point the rally was over

1924
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
so I was just ready to leave

1925
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
of course the picture you uploaded of

1926
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
yourself in the in that crowd on that

1927
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
website yeah I'm really glad

1928
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
some website I put it on

1929
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Twitter some website got a picture that like you can

1930
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
you can see me

1931
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
oh yeah Colcorona was there too

1932
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Colcorona's there giving the thumbs down

1933
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
aww that guy he gets around

1934
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
he's always involved with something interesting

1935
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
he's having a lot of adventures

1936
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
he's he's a loose cannon

1937
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
oh dude that arm band looks like a

1938
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
fuck what is it it's like a wild cherry

1939
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
black monster or something

1940
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
it does yeah if you're right it looks like

1941
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
you know what maybe Antifa had some

1942
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
good ideas after all that's all I'm saying

1943
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
the ultra the ultra black

1944
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
that's the one that's the one

1945
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
anyway it was pretty it was

1946
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
pretty cool it was pretty cool

1947
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and um you know some shit

1948
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I want to I want to go get

1949
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
pepper spray I want to be involved with something

1950
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
that that has violence in it some

1951
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
some you know some people said like don't show

1952
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
up like this is what they want and like sure

1953
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I kind of agree I think it's

1954
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
true like they obviously did this with

1955
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the intention of trolling

1956
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and riling up a big group

1957
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
to like you know be mad you know triggering the

1958
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
libs right and I guess

1959
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
in that way that succeeded I guess this

1960
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
is probably what they want so much for the tolerant

1961
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
left here we go once again there

1962
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
was there was like during there there was a guy

1963
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
at like because like the police barricade

1964
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
was like a big sort of space they kept like a

1965
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
big space clear between like us and

1966
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
them and there were a couple of people

1967
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
just like hanging out at the like other

1968
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
end of the barricade like you know waving straight

1969
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
pride flags at us there was a guy with a

1970
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
microphone who kept like yelling stuff at us

1971
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
but it wasn't loud enough when we couldn't hear

1972
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
what he was saying so it was I don't know

1973
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I don't know what but they were

1974
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
they were just they were loving the attention

1975
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
they were loving it it was great so I guess

1976
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
in a sense this is what they wanted but

1977
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I think that the net effect of it

1978
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
is good and I'm glad that I went because I

1979
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
think that it's a good thing to show

1980
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
up and make the statement that like

1981
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
there's more of us than there are of you

1982
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
we think you suck we don't want you here

1983
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
and like hopefully this is like

1984
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I mean hopefully this is enough of a disturbance

1985
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
that they wouldn't grant permission for a similar

1986
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
shitty event like this in the future

1987
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
because they're not because like the mayor

1988
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
said like he oh he had to approve this

1989
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
event because he had he approves them based

1990
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
on operational feasibility and not on

1991
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
politics but like what does that mean

1992
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
you're obligated to approve a permit

1993
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
for any event that well I mean can

1994
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
happen fucking the fucking KKK

1995
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
were given a thing back in the day and I mean

1996
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
you know that's like a free speech issue right so I mean

1997
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
if those guys at some point at

1998
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
but they had at some point someone has

1999
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
to have the ability to say

2000
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
like this event just sucks

2001
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
well you know it's different actually

2002
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
they can't they can't I don't know

2003
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
exactly what the chain of command is that approves

2004
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
or denies permits for these things but they can't

2005
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
be obligated to allow

2006
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
any event that can occur

2007
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
to occur I was gonna say like

2008
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
if I submitted one that's like

2009
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
utterly retarded that has no

2010
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
basically if I'm sincere in my beliefs

2011
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and making it like okay I will the KKK

2012
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
those guys probably believe what they say

2013
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
they probably were sincere in their

2014
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
you know hate to minorities and what not

2015
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
so that's like a real thing I guess

2016
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
they're really trying to say but I mean

2017
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
these guys are far more shit posty

2018
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I would imagine but like

2019
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
maybe they made a good faith argument like

2020
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
no we are argument at least is we're really

2021
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
just trying to say it's okay to be straight

2022
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
which technically fine

2023
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
so I don't know the logic

2024
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
they're pretty it's pretty clear

2025
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
if you read their Facebook page that this is

2026
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
you know just like a dumb

2027
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
if I was there I drew down people who seemed like

2028
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
they were just fucking around yeah and like it's really

2029
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
like they didn't even make it try to seem like a real thing

2030
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and I don't know I really don't buy the excuse that

2031
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
oh I just had to I don't know

2032
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
why this got approved and I don't think it should have been

2033
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I want to get in on this I want to

2034
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
you know I think if you

2035
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
forget everything I said before about if you

2036
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
take part in either side you're a loser I take it back

2037
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I think that if you have the opportunity

2038
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
to participate in civil unrest

2039
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you should take it because it's fucking cool

2040
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
regardless of what side you're on

2041
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
you know I want to go to one of these things

2042
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and I want to just be holding a sign that says

2043
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I'm just here for the violence

2044
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I want pepper spray

2045
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
flying I want bricks

2046
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
flying I want to be right in the middle

2047
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
of all of it baby I want to fucking

2048
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
thing around I want to fucking mask around the bottom

2049
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
of my face so I look cool I want to fucking

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000

in the head oh you know oh getting punched

2052
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000

2053
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000

2054
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
with cold corona next to cold corona

2055
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000

2056
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
wearing sunglasses and the black hat okay

2057
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
yeah thing about that guy is he was right next

2058
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000

2059
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
like fat guy who's also in like a black hoodie

2060
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and as we're standing in

2061
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
that line like right across from us was the

2062
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
police barricade they were like standing

2063
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
along the parade route preventing us from blocking the street

2064
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and these two guys

2065
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
they were literally doing

2066
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
like a antifa

2067
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Abaddon Costello routine

2068
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and they were doing like a little like back

2069
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
and forth like jokie thing like they were

2070
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
they were like talking to the cops about like

2071
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
like oh like you can you like oh you can see

2072
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
these guys don't want to be here and stuff and they're like

2073
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
oh look at these I don't know they were just

2074
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
okay they weren't that funny but what they were attempting

2075
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
to do was like a sort of

2076
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
ad hoc comedy Abaddon Costello

2077
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
they were putting an image in your

2078
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
brain that you could make funnier and it was

2079
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
just funny because there was like a tall

2080
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
skinny one and a short fat one and they were

2081
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
they were just like they looked

2082
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
like a they looked like a comedy duo

2083
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and I I appreciated

2084
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
the effort at least you know like I

2085
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
obviously I'm a man with a lot of

2086
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
straight pride let me tell you I'm just filled

2087
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
to the brim with straight pride and

2088
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
but but you know

2089
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
like in something like this it does seem to me the guys

2090
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
are obviously shit posters whatever they don't need to parade

2091
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
maybe it's fine I don't whatever I don't care

2092
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I don't really blame anybody for coming to protest

2093
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
because obviously it's it's the like

2094
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
thing of like getting real close

2095
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
like I'm not touching you I'm not touching you

2096
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
you're like real close at a certain point

2097
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
it's just gonna trigger a response and

2098
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
like I'm happy to see I didn't look at a news reports

2099
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
everybody here looks pretty reasonable

2100
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I don't blame it for booing or anything but like

2101
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I see the girl in the front with the like we

2102
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
support cis people straight people normal

2103
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
people that's not like saying like fuck

2104
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
straight people so like

2105
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I just seems like a positive

2106
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
message overall and they're not

2107
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you know in any way being overly negative at least

2108
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
the guy's putting on the guys like

2109
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
from the tone of the Facebook post and

2110
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
like the history like the guys the guys

2111
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
hosting this event are like the same guys

2112
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
who in 2007 they hosted a quote

2113
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
unquote free speech rally which was

2114
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
just a it was just like an alt-right

2115
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
like trolling event basically they're just

2116
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
sure they're they're not

2117
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
they're not they're not good dudes

2118
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
they're not they're not doing this in good faith

2119
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
push back against the term alt-right being applied

2120
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
like is Milo really alt-right I mean he's very

2121
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
right I'm not even I'm not even talking about Milo

2122
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
although there's other

2123
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't like Milo either yeah all right

2124
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
so so yeah I got pepper sprayed and it was

2125
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
epic that's my story

2126
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
regarding the like

2127
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
giving them what they want though

2128
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I feel like

2129
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
it's so like giving them what they want

2130
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
is like they want to trigger the left

2131
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
ease because they think it's funny

2132
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
allegedly presumably

2133
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I think

2134
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
it's it's so much

2135
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
like worse to like not

2136
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
go for fear of making them

2137
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
laugh like giving them a jolly

2138
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
yeah like oh

2139
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
like oh it's kind of no way to win really

2140
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
no but like the them winning

2141
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
isn't that much of a big win I think we

2142
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
want to like the failure it would be

2143
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
if we just let them do it

2144
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
yeah yeah if they if they just if we

2145
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
just let them do it

2146
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
then like yeah hey cold corona

2147
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
always picks the winning side

2148
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
look look I just

2149
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I just think it makes the statement the

2150
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
it's the right statement to make that like

2151
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
10 times more counter

2152
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
protesters showed up then like actual

2153
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
attendees look that's fine

2154
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
like I'm sure people like Milo will

2155
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
spin it as like we triggered them

2156
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
so like it's so few of us triggered them so

2157
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I mean what does it really mean but like yeah

2158
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it seems fine seems reasonable

2159
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
well that's the thing I don't blame anyone

2160
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
for going but just just consider the reality where

2161
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
like this wouldn't ever happen but imagine

2162
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
if literally no one showed up to observe

2163
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
that would itself be a statement that

2164
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
you know but they would they would then also

2165
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
spin it as like obviously I see

2166
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
what I see what you mean like that they

2167
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
were too scared to come and fight us but

2168
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
yeah right like it's always gonna be

2169
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
something yeah I mean you know when you've

2170
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
got an agenda no matter what side you

2171
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
find yeah

2172
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I mean that would be pretty funny if like

2173
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
they're like nobody even showed up to

2174
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
counterprotect but like yeah that wasn't

2175
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
gonna happen and we're not there yet

2176
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
like I think in a perfect

2177
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
in a perfect world probably nobody would

2178
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
pay any attention to this kind of thing

2179
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
but like these same these same people

2180
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
they put on like they said they are

2181
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
they did another thing like this in 2017

2182
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
they're gonna like keep doing it yeah

2183
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
yeah yeah like I said I don't know if I

2184
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
have any straight pride specifically

2185
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
but I do know that all of the

2186
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
pride I do have is very

2187
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
straight all my pride is very

2188
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
straight I have no pride

2189
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I feel you on that and this was oh and

2190
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
also while I was there this this is

2191
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
happened to be the same day that Munchy

01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000

01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
this would come to be known later in the

2253
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
annals of history as

2254
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
uh uh scholars recount Nate's

2255
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
story as the day of pain

2256
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the day of pain uh as you

2257
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
know to continue the spirit of munchy

2258
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
so the first thing that happens in the

2259
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
day is we're both hungry we get there and we

2260
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
decide to eat some food now

2261
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
we cannot find any healthy alternatives

2262
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
so we get a couple of corn dogs

2263
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and we I see I see deep fried

2264
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
twinkies on the menu

2265
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and I just think to myself well I've gotta

2266
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
buy those I have to get in on this

2267
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
action so I do uh Michelle

2268
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
takes like a bite she's like this is disgusting I never want

2269
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
this near me ever again I so I'm like okay

2270
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I'll eat yours and I eat them all I

2271
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
consume all the fried food this

2272
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
would throughout throughout the day my

2273
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
constitution score

2274
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
dropped like 20 points I am dying

2275
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
it is don't do it don't

2276
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
listen to your base or instincts be

2277
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
an intellectual being and don't eat

2278
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
fried food ever it's a mistake every time

2279
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
okay so this is the

2280
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
so this is the first step in my my path

2281
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
of pain on the day of pain of me

2282
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
experiencing agony throughout the entire day

2283
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
okay um so later on I go

2284
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
into a bathroom and I just notice that this

2285
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
is an omen of the future I notice

2286
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
the words uh fuck

2287
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
god carved into this to

2288
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
the wall and also uh

2289
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
what was it oh there was a swastika next to it

2290
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
and then also the words tiny

2291
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Tim is a fag I don't know

2292
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
exactly what that was referring to

2293
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
but oh and I have pictures of it

2294
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
living in the sunlight loving in the moon

2295
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
like having a wonderful time

2296
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
was it was it of course uh our boy the

2297
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
the Christmas Eve man I I don't know

2298
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I'll never know but uh so so

2299
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
this is again the the the omens the darkness

2300
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
is continuing to progress

2301
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
so um let me see where was

2302
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I okay so we progress throughout the day

2303
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm experienced we do all the tilted worlds

2304
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
all kinds of crazy shit it's it's a bad time

2305
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
for me my stomach is churning I'm dying

2306
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I want to puke but I don't have managed to hold it

2307
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
off until then until the end here

2308
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
so the end of the day is coming we're

2309
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
about to leave I'm still feeling sick

2310
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and uh we went to the water park

2311
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
there and as we are leaving the water park

2312
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
we're about to leave I did my swimming I'm

2313
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
having a high I'm feeling good we notice

2314
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
that there is a diving board

2315
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and there's a high dive as well

2316
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
now I don't know if you guys have been on a high dive before

2317
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
but it's pretty fucking high

2318
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
it is like I don't know maybe 10 feet off

2319
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
the water and I think of myself will obviously

2320
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I've got to give this a try

2321
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
so I go to the high dive it hurts

2322
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I do a dive it was fine no big deal

2323
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I'm too I'm too pussy to a

2324
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
fucking normal dive I do a cannonball

2325
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
cause I don't want to hurt my body

2326
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
um okay so that went fine

2327
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
if I were diving off the high I'd be afraid that I would

2328
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
over correct and like go upside down you know what I mean

2329
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
indeed like your feet

2330
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
extend beyond your and you rotate

2331
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
oh you wouldn't want that one could only

2332
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and you land on your back

2333
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
oh yeah that's that's this is a

2334
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
nightmare this is a nightmare to be

2335
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
avoided at all costs so I think

2336
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
of myself you know what that first cannonball went okay

2337
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I think it's time to do an actual dive

2338
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
so I go I do a dive goes reasonably well

2339
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
still in pain that's okay now from

2340
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
this moment on I'm witnessing the little

2341
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
children are gathering around and they're all

2342
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
they're not looking at me they're just they're just doing the diving board

2343
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and I'm like okay I'm just going to do a couple of dives

2344
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
for fun off of the

2345
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
like the lower boards I'm doing this

2346
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
for a while and then I see the children start

2347
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
to do flips and I've decided my quest

2348
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
for the day my diamond back for the day

2349
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
is to do a flip

2350
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
is to do a flip off the diving board this

2351
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
has become my quest

2352
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
this would result in the

2353
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
day of pain coming to a gruesome head

2354
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
one can only imagine

2355
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
so I'm practicing my flips

2356
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I'm doing it over and over I'm getting nowhere

2357
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
uh one of my early attempts

2358
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
is is and I'm doing like a twisting

2359
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
jerking motion I'm scared I'm I'm in

2360
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
fear now Michelle was actually a diver

2361
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
for like many years like a swim team

2362
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
diver so she knows exactly what she's doing

2363
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and it's roasting there from the sidelines

2364
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
you looking real gay out there Nate you

2365
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
gotta get your shit together and

2366
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
things of this nature

2367
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
uh you know when you're doing dives

2368
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
you're if you hit the water wrong

2369
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
the the pain the pain begins to

2370
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
rise and you feel the soreness creeping

2371
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
all over your body so I'm sick

2372
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm scared the fear of God

2373
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
is in me Satan is amongst me and

2374
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I'm increasing the damage over my body

2375
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
but I will not give up because I'm seeing

2376
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
children of like five years old

2377
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
do flips all around me and they're having

2378
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
no trouble whatsoever and so I've

2379
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
committed I must do a flip

2380
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
over and over and over again

2381
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I think I'm gonna do it Michelle gives me

2382
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
a couple of pointers I I I managed to

2383
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
rotate like 80% of a flip

2384
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
but this results oh no in

2385
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
you know exactly what you just mentioned

2386
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
man a big hit the water

2387
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
no it's my my

2388
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
side is a shearing red color

2389
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Michelle tells me she reports back to me

2390
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
that at this moment everyone audibly

2391
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
winces in the in the crowd

2392
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
gathering around and they see me fuck up

2393
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
this bad even the lifeguard

2394
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
even the lifeguard but I've

2395
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
decided I will I will suffer

2396
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
the pain I will continue to rack up agony until

2397
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I can do this fucking flip like these babies

2398
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
now I could this continues for another

2399
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
like I don't know 15 20 minutes of me just

2400
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
throwing my body over and over again

2401
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
just my HP bar is depleting slowly

2402
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
like I've got the poison status

2403
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
you just kept doing it I just kept doing

2404
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
it I had to do your HP

2405
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
bar is depleting but your limit break

2406
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
bar is rising you know

2407
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
but you are so right Jesse you are so

2408
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
right because after after another

2409
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
big flop a big searing

2410
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
activity might people can see people don't

2411
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
want to see a man hurt himself in this way

2412
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
over and over again at a children's

2413
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
amusement park so so

2414
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
nobody wants to see a grown man

2415
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
cry no no the children

2416
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
at this point are in fact

2417
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
cheering me on and they they have taken

2418
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
notice of my activities and so I

2419
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
make a little great gang of conspirators

2420
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
co-conspirators the ones who are good at flipping

2421
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
they're like dude okay you gotta do it like this

2422
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
you gotta tuck your body Michelle's giving me advice

2423
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
and even after a while the lifeguard himself is like

2424
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
bro you gotta rotate your arms up you gotta

2425
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
extend your arms to get more momentum

2426
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
so you'll stop fucking killing yourself

2427
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000

2453
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I know the technique I do

2454
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
a correct flip one time and I think to myself

2455
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I'm a master

2456
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
easy shit easy I have literally

2457
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
achieved god mode

2458
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
fuck this I'm going back high

2459
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
so just like a fucking sultan I strut

2460
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
up to the high dive

2461
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I fucking run off that shit I do

2462
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I use all the techniques I've learned

2463
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
away I'm sorry I forgot I forgot before

2464
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
before I get to that in the middle

2465
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
of my of my session the lowest point

2466
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
as I was I was on my learning

2467
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
montage there's a moment where

2468
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I've learned a couple of skills I've done this a couple times

2469
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I'm getting to the end of the board

2470
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
but all of a sudden panic strikes me as

2471
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm afraid that I'm gonna fuck it up and increase my pain

2472
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
it's just the agony is gonna rise over and over

2473
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
and as I'm I'm like I've got like one

2474
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
toe loony tune style I'm dangling off

2475
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
the end I'm trying to pull myself out so I can

2476
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
fix my posture and I just yell to the heavens

2477
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I'm gonna goof it

2478
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and then I slowly tumble off

2479
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
the edge and fall and this was the

2480
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
this was whenever this is the big the big flop

2481
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
that no one was no one was on my side

2482
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
but as I said

2483
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I immediately turned against you started

2484
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
pelting you with garbage that's exactly

2485
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
what happened okay but as I said

2486
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I eventually I managed to do one solid

2487
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
flip and I'm cocky as hell so I go off to the high dive

2488
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
okay I'm on the high dive

2489
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
everyone's cheering the applause

2490
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
everyone's saying this is the boy this is the golden man

2491
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
he did one flip and meanwhile

2492
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
there was like this girl who did like triple fucking front flips

2493
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
and pirouettes off the fucking

2494
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
thing it was embarrassing nonetheless

2495
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
now is my time to shine I go

2496
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I climb the high dive I attempt

2497
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
to do the perfect dive

2498
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I've studied the techniques I know what I'm doing now

2499
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I feel myself launching off the

2500
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
end of the board I'm rotating into

2501
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
midair 90 degrees 180 degrees

2502
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
what's after that

2503
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
270 360 but

2504
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
but oh god

2505
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I'm still going I haven't hit I'm

2506
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
overcorrecting I'm still rotating

2507
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
my back is literally 180

2508
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
degree parallel to the water down below

2509
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I

2510
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I rotate once more or something like

2511
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
that and my my I feel myself

2512
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
time stops I am floating

2513
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
spread eagle arms

2514
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
wide legs wide hanging

2515
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
floating one inch above the water

2516
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
a perfect belly flop position

2517
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
and then time begins

2518
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
again and I hit the water

2519
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
the impact

2520
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
of this of this impact

2521
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
now this was a successful flip I did

2522
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
a successful flip but the cost

2523
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
the cost of this this is

2524
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
what's been known to you know that people

2525
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
in ancient Rome

2526
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
people in ancient Greece they speculated the source

2527
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
of thunder they did not know what caused

2528
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
lightning to happen it was this

2529
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
it was this is what God was

2530
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
doing belly flops and this is exactly what happened

2531
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
to me off the 10 foot fucking

2532
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
high dive the impact

2533
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
of this again was reported

2534
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
to me later to cause every woman

2535
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
in the vicinity to lose

2536
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
all chance of giving birth at the sheer

2537
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
lack of sexuality present

2538
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
in this environment they're all fertile

2539
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
they're all infertile forever all

2540
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
the men all their dicks were treated into

2541
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
their bodies and the sound of this

2542
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
happened all the nearby children

2543
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and I I I emerged back

2544
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
to the surface literally unable

2545
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
to move my arms due to the searing

2546
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
agony in every part of my fucking

2547
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
body and if you

2548
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
look close if you look close

2549
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
at the image I'm uploading right now

2550
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
you can see that in fact not a lie this is

2551
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
100% accurate I am literally

2552
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
bleeding out of my nose because the

2553
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
impact on my face and skull

2554
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
fucked up my neck and

2555
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
fucked up my face my nose was

2556
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
actually damaged and it

2557
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
bled for a good long while after this

2558
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
everyone

2559
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
you see the blood there's blood

2560
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
in that nose yeah you can see that

2561
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
just a little just a little

2562
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
blood there just a little

2563
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
little bit of blood look at the little blood

2564
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
that's that's all you need

2565
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
that's all you need and

2566
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
you know I did it because

2567
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I did my fucking flip I did

2568
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
my flip off the high dive you should

2569
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
quit while you were ahead the consequences

2570
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
now I don't know if you can see this you got to raise the contrast

2571
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
but the red was on my entire

2572
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
body it had begun to fade at this point

2573
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
but my whole body

2574
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
is seething I feel it right now my right

2575
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
leg is gone

2576
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
it doesn't exist anymore it was destroyed

2577
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
by the impact the force was too much

2578
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
anyway that's it people

2579
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I did it I fucking did it but this was

2580
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
this was the peak moment of pain

2581
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
probably in the last I don't know

2582
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
10 years of my life or so well I

2583
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
was smashing the flesh Nate was

2584
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
splashing the flesh

2585
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
oh that's right Ben that's right

2586
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
and that's why I'm a winner

2587
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I didn't give up though

2588
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I'm a champ I did it but the cost

2589
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
will haunt me from never be the same

2590
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
that's all there is to it well you know I also

2591
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
have a I also have a story

2592
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
of great triumphs and great falls

2593
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
speaking of you know pushing

2594
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
your body past its physical limits

2595
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
of being proud of accomplishing something

2596
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
instead of just being straight which anyone

2597
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
can do the gays are pretty bad at it

2598
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
though to be fair I finally

2599
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
started going to the gym every day

2600
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I got a membership I started kicking

2601
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000

the gym but once I was in there

2620
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I was blown away at how fucking easy

2621
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
it is to work out it is it's just so

2622
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
boring when it's when you're by yourself

2623
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
yeah it's a drag so

2624
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I've been going there every day and I'm

2625
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000

2631
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000

just fucking meats and fucking steaks and shit

2633
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I'm not eating any garbage except

2634
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
the other day my mom got me a fucking quarter

2635
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000

01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
yep yep but that doesn't count so I

2637
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I know the feeling well

2638
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
that's fantastic once you're the hardest

2639
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
thing by far is getting the momentum

2640
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
up once you're in the swing

2641
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
that's that's the golden zone and I was

2642
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I was so I've been so proud

2643
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
of myself and like like experiencing

2644
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000

2645
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
mood I've had in like four years

2646
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
it's a legit mood booster it is working out

2647
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and the pride you feel from doing it

2648
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I've been working out for maybe two months

2649
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
now and like and yeah

2650
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I definitely just feel like

2651
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
more positive emotionally

2652
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
it's great yeah like I like

2653
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
right after the first day like I

01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I got there before Juan so you know

2760
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
usually like we hit the treadmill and then

2761
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
we go to the weights so

2762
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
by the time Juan got in I was done with the

2763
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
treadmill so I was doing the weights before

2764
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000

01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
myself but then Juan's just starting

2768
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000

01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
for me to even get to this point in my life

2874
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
when I am here at the gym every

2875
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
day at all doing as much as I am

2876
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000

2877
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000

idiot I'm sure he had good intentions

2882
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I'm sure I

2883
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I don't like

2884
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I don't like how he did it I don't like

2885
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000

2886
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000

01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
dude that that kind of shit

2888
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
guys like that that that is exactly the

2889
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
reason I didn't go to the gym for

2890
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
the first 30 years of my life and it's

2891
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
exactly the reason why millions of people

2892
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
don't because it's fucking

2893
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
embarrassing and patronizing and

2894
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000

2895
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
like I get that like you know

2896
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
one knows the guy so he can you know that's

2897
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
one thing for one it's motivational

2898
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and that's what he said like one's messaging me on the way

2899
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
home he's like yeah he didn't mean anything he's trying to

2900
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
motivate you and I'm like I know dude

2901
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
and it you know but he doesn't know me

2902
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
and I'm fucking pissed off

2903
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and then you know one such a sweetheart

2904
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000

and I stood up for you and I

2908
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
and I told him that and

2909
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
you know I hope this doesn't stop you from

2910
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
coming in and I'm like

2911
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000

2912
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
there tomorrow same as every day and

2913
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
then you then I went home and I

2914
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
watched Detective Pikachu and I cried

2915
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
because the fucking emotional toll

2916
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
was so fucking I was

2917
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I was feeling really hormonal

2918
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
because like the combination of my

2919
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
of my rage

2920
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
at this guy and like my

2921
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
love for Juan and his brotherly kindness

2922
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
standing up for me in the gym

2923
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
after I left you know I don't know exactly

2924
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
what he must have said to the guy but I'm assuming

2925
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
that what he said is that the guy said

2926
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
hey weird your friend go man

2927
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
and I'm just assuming that Juan looked at him

2928
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
and in his best Lars Ulrich

2929
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
voice said he fucking

2930
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
left the gym!

2931
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
hahaha

2932
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
oh baby there you

2933
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
go

2934
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
you know I don't know about you guys I have a lot

2935
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
of faith look I've been in

2936
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
decent shape like okay shape

2937
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
for last several years but this like meme

2938
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
it's like a stereotype of guys like

2939
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
getting hot in their 30s getting like

2940
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
swollen ripped and stuff it fills me

2941
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
with a lot of confidence that no matter

2942
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
what I do I will inevitably

2943
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
be swole in my 30s this

2944
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
is where my thinking goes I don't

2945
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
know why but it seems to like happen

2946
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
it makes sense it makes sense every time I see

2947
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
a guy in his 40s he's got that like

2948
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
that weathered like rip

2949
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
shit body yeah

2950
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I believe it I think it's just a natural

2951
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
thing there's natural progression

2952
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
you get fucking swole

2953
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I knew a girl growing up

2954
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I guess I won't say her name but like her dad

2955
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
was just so fucking

2956
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
swole it was like insane he's just like some

2957
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
normal like super nice guy

2958
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
he was like a leader in our Boy Scout trip

2959
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
weird how much hotter he was

2960
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
than like every other person around

2961
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
what a fucking badass he just did

2962
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Bowflex every day I don't

2963
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I don't remember who you're talking about

2964
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
but okay he might have been

2965
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
he was like a younger guy's dad

2966
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
so he might have joined like after you left

2967
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
or something I don't know I don't know

2968
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
okay whatever whatever should we go to

2969
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
voicemail yeah I think we're ready

2970
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000

story sure feel free

2973
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
but it's really just like a change

2974
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I cut my hair

2975
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
oh my god how short is it

2976
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I have short hair now

2977
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
do you have pictures

2978
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I don't like

2979
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
showing pictures

2980
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
okay just give us an idea of how short

2981
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
well it's not like a buzz cut

2982
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
it's okay

2983
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
my I don't know

2984
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
what like shaving things

2985
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
are called like are we talking

2986
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Ronald Weasley length Harry Potter length

2987
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I'm using examples you'll understand

2988
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
those are like the same length

2989
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
uh nah

2990
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
it's like they said it was a number

2991
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
six something on the razor

2992
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
okay that's yeah okay that makes sense to me

2993
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
so

2994
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
you know it's it's the

2995
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
strangely doesn't feel that different

2996
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I thought it would be like oh my god my head

2997
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
can move in so many other different directions

2998
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
it can't it's the same

2999
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
um some people expecting a big power

3000
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
upgrade yeah I was expecting

3001
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I was expecting like I was like

3002
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
you know taking off the weights and now suddenly

3003
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
my neck could go 100 miles an hour

3004
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
you're like Goku and Krillin taking off the

3005
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
turtle shells yeah exactly

3006
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
um

3007
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
apparently according to

3008
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
my mom

3009
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
and also and also some just

3010
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
random people who were at a party a few days

3011
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
later I looked younger

3012
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
and I looked good and dude

3013
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I assume

3014
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I assume they're telling the truth

3015
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
we'll tell you the truth

3016
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
dude we'll fucking roast you

3017
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
we'll kill you

3018
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
we will murder you

3019
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
this is this is why I was like a little hesitant

3020
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
about like saying yes to posting

3021
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
the uh the wizard

3022
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
flying on a broomstick thing because I didn't

3023
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
wear a hat and you could see

3024
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
you could see my fucking hairline

3025
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I must see

3026
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
uh

3027
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'll think about it I'll think about it

3028
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I don't actually have a picture yet

3029
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
you're just gonna hide your face until it grows

3030
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
back and pretend nothing happened

3031
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
yeah yeah that's that's

3032
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
that's the plan

3033
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
any uh any reason for the change in

3034
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
particular um well

3035
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I've been feeling like

3036
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I don't do anything

3037
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
with the fact that my hair is long

3038
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
like I just have it long because it's been long for

3039
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
a while and

3040
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
really it started

3041
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
at secondary schools like like

3042
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
almost a decade of having

3043
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
long curly hair

3044
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
and I got bullied for it and I guess

3045
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
in my in my efforts to

3046
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
like defy bullies

3047
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I just didn't do what they wanted me to do

3048
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
and get normal hair

3049
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and so I had weird hair forever

3050
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
and uh some people like it

3051
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
but um

3052
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I'm tired of not being normal and having

3053
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
people stare at me all the time

3054
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
fair enough fair enough

3055
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
also it's really hot and it's just like

3056
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
yeah you know I understand now

3057
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
why it's a good idea to cut it

3058
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I bet it looks good

3059
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I have I'm optimistic about it

3060
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I agree

3061
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000

3062
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000

PCP

01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
uh I was really intrigued

3087
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
you guys talked about rad con last episode

3088
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
uh I got pretty hyped

3089
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
um question was

3090
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
about lectures and basically

3091
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
every single one of you provided some

3092
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
sort of idea for what you want to do

3093
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
besides one person

3094
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
uh Nate you completely dodged

3095
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
the fucking question

3096
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
but a bigger question for you guys

3097
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
as creators as a whole

3098
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
do you like to hype up

3099
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
the creation

3100
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
of a video

3101
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
or piece of work that you guys do

3102
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
or do you like to keep things

3103
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
secret because I sort of

3104
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
get that vibe more from

3105
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Nate more than anyone here just because

3106
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
of that last question

3107
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I do not like to hype stuff up

3108
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
ahead of time but if I have

3109
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
an opportunity to do so I

3110
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
will sometimes do it

3111
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
because I think it's a good idea

3112
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
even though I don't like to do it

3113
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
it's not it's not fun

3114
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I enjoy

3115
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
um the feeling of having

3116
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
a hype thing that I could tell

3117
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
people and I like keeping it

3118
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
special for the people

3119
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
who are like cool like if I

3120
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
if I meet like um

3121
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
like lemon tart I met in London

3122
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
he was he was a cool guy and I like him

3123
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
and you know he showed me around

3124
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Madrid and so he was asking me

3125
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
about stuff and so I told

3126
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
him a few plans I had and they

3127
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
weren't like fully formed yet but it was

3128
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
just sort of like you know

3129
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
he's he's really nice and he's

3130
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
in person I think this is a good time

3131
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
to like to allow that like it

3132
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
seems strange to do it

3133
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
online because

3134
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
um people bullshitting

3135
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
online it yeah much more

3136
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
like like nobody knows

3137
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
what they want and when you show them

3138
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
the coolest thing ever then they're

3139
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
just just good it's just good to keep it

3140
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
under wraps until there's something

3141
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
substantial but in person

3142
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I feel like if it can make for good

3143
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
conversation then I'll I'll hype someone up

3144
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
that's fair it's it's

3145
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
you talked about this too

3146
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
uh speaking of hype I guess

3147
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I was thinking about whether I should

3148
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
do this but I do need

3149
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
to hype this up and I I think

3150
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
okay I can't 100% guarantee

3151
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
this but I am almost ready

3152
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and I think that maybe

3153
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
a week from when you are listening

3154
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
to this podcast the Vapors

3155
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Kickstarter 2

3156
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
may be live so

3157
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
a week from right now

3158
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
you might hear me saying hey

3159
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
go to Kickstarter right now link in the description

3160
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
the Kickstarter is a go because we are

3161
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I am I like I said

3162
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I yeah that that

3163
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
John Cleese lecture I watch that because

3164
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I was like I need to get my shit together

3165
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
and I watch that and I was like I feel better

3166
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
now and now I understand what I have to do a little better

3167
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
and I've been doing it and I have written

3168
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
four out of the six

3169
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
scripts that I needed to do

3170
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
for the for the guest strips so we are

3171
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
almost ready and possibly next week

3172
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
the Kickstarter will be launching

3173
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
yeah so the hi I

3174
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
don't really

3175
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I don't really like doing hype even though

3176
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
it's a good idea like it's a good idea

3177
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
to hype up a thing before you do it

3178
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
yeah I like just

3179
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
putting something out there and having people

3180
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
see it that that's the

3181
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
good that's the fun part not the hyping

3182
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
is the is the reaction to the thing

3183
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I think the the best

3184
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
way to go about it is to hype

3185
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
vaguely so like

3186
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm gonna do a thing on this date is like

3187
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
what what what things are you gonna do and that makes

3188
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
that builds that builds hype

3189
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
for people to be

3190
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
anticipating something

3191
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
but they don't like have an idea

3192
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
of what they should be expecting necessarily

3193
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I mean you know if you make

3194
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
want if you make videos or comics

3195
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
or whatever they're gonna be assuming

3196
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
it's one of those

3197
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
but they you know the the Vega

3198
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
you keep it it feels like a lot of

3199
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
brands are doing this as well

3200
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
and movie trailers as well

3201
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
the very

3202
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
maybe not movie trailers I don't keep up

3203
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
those trailers that are just there are just

3204
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
for example just a logo like bayonetta 3

3205
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
yeah we saw and and and

3206
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Star Wars is like there's nothing in the

3207
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
trailer like I've seen it I was like

3208
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
well cool I guess

3209
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
nothing there's nothing there

3210
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
maybe there's nothing in the movie

3211
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
but it's still it still builds

3212
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
hype just as effectively because people are being

3213
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
reminded that a thing is about to come out

3214
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
and when it comes out they will be

3215
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
ready and willing and able to listen

3216
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
and watch rather than if you

3217
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
just posted it people

3218
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
might not like catch on

3219
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
because there was no nothing you know to

3220
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
to remind them to pay attention

3221
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
that's true

3222
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
you know

3223
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
on the subject here I mean first of all

3224
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
the person astutely noted I did not

3225
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
comment on my thing that that is in fact

3226
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
deliberate because I didn't want

3227
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I mean whatever like I just

3228
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
as exactly as you said I like to keep

3229
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
things secretive and I'll tell you

3230
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
there's multiple reasons why one is because

3231
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I find the hype cycle

3232
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
both kind of counterproductive

3233
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I mean in this way of like tell like look at the ghost in the shell

3234
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
thing when it's kind of counterproductive

3235
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
and like it

3236
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
can it put and the other things it puts

3237
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
expectations

3238
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
on things that I think are not actually helpful

3239
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
and I almost think it's

3240
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
almost kind of immoral

3241
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
in a sense to like

3242
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
like what if you fail then it's like

3243
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
you've kind of disappointed

3244
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
everyone and like they were wrong

3245
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
to it's almost like you lied

3246
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
if you have promised something then you don't deliver

3247
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
what people expect I don't know that one's a little more bullshit

3248
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
yeah I very much

3249
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I very much dislike the

3250
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
stress of promising anything

3251
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
like once I

3252
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
once I like let it known

3253
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
that I'm going to do something then it becomes

3254
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
an obligation and I don't want to do it

3255
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
yes that's a big part of it too

3256
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
whereas when I can drop something I just prefer

3257
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
to surprise people yeah that's all positive

3258
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
there's no expectation and it feels good

3259
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
and I think everyone's kind of better off that way

3260
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
but I will be super clear on another

3261
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
reason why I do it

3262
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
another reason why I hate to announce project is

3263
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
in case

3264
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
they fall through or I fail

3265
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
or it isn't as good

3266
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
as like I might have

3267
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
hyped it up to be things of that nature

3268
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I do not want to be

3269
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
the guy who fails to live up to

3270
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
expectations I want to be the guy

3271
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
who provided something even if it's only

3272
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
mildly entertaining because it's

3273
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
a lot better than failing people's

3274
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
expectations in my in my opinion

3275
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
on the other hand hyping

3276
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
a thing up it it it affects

3277
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
me like part of

3278
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
like saying that I'm

3279
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
going to be launching the Kickstarter

3280
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
next week makes it a lot more likely

3281
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
that I will actually do it

3282
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
that's definitely true that all right

3283
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
that's a thing but like

3284
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I mean assume

3285
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
not as much about it is like

3286
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
a creative process it's mostly just like to

3287
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
actually create the Kickstarter and do all the

3288
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
busy work well it's half and half because I

3289
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
have to write the scripts but right

3290
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
but like I feel

3291
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
like a hyping up something that you have

3292
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
to be creative for

3293
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
is a little more like

3294
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
nuanced and how

3295
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
like variable and how well it works

3296
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
because you might just lose

3297
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
like your focus or like you won't

3298
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
have an idea or you won't be able to think

3299
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
of something creative enough if you still have

3300
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
to do like all the creative work

3301
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
before the thing is realized and like you don't

3302
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
really know how it's going to turn out

3303
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
while you're hyping it

3304
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
but you know on this one thing I am

3305
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
somewhat assuaged in my fears

3306
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
by the fact that like

3307
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
for example when we were planning Radcon 3

3308
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
like one of my worries was that like we'll

3309
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
make things that are bad but like

3310
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I've really have come to the

3311
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
conclusion during Radcon 2

3312
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
2 but like working with you guys on

3313
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
that content I was worried to be bullshit

3314
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
but like it just seems to almost

3315
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
magically happen that we just

3316
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
make good stuff so like

3317
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
at this point I feel comfortable saying like

3318
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
if we did Radcon 4 tomorrow I'd be like

3319
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
guys give to Radcon 4 I know it will be

3320
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
good I have all the confidence in the

3321
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
world we will make things people enjoy

3322
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
even though I don't know at all what those things

3323
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
will be we just produce

3324
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
products that are enjoyable

3325
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
and that's a pretty powerful

3326
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
thing that makes me feel good

3327
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
you gotta believe in the process

3328
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
at some point at some level you kinda just gotta

3329
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
have confidence and believe in yourself

3330
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
and to say and to promise like I'm gonna

3331
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
make this thing you kinda just have to like

3332
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
trust that you can do

3333
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
it and like a lot

3334
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
of the time just believing that you can

3335
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
do it will empower

3336
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
you to do it I feel good

3337
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I also have acquired

3338
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
a sense that like if I sit down

3339
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
and decide I'm going to make a project I

3340
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
feel confident that I can

3341
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
make almost anything I wanna do

3342
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
good and entertaining and enjoyable

3343
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
but the issue that I

3344
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
have with all this is like the logistics

3345
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
and the time management of making

3346
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
sure I get to these things and get them done

3347
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
and like now it's like I gotta

3348
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
make money while doing it cause it's my job and stuff

3349
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
like will I be able to

3350
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
balance all those things?

3351
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
That for me is the big variable question

3352
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
cause you know like I wanted to

3353
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
have like a big video out every month

3354
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
once I was like pro doing this stuff

3355
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
but like I've had tough time managing

3356
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
my time with we Aguas and doing other stuff

3357
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
it's like I have not done that yet and it's been two months

3358
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
so like that's that's this is

3359
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
my big concern with stuff like this

3360
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I okay do you guys

3361
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
remember that idea I had for a lecture

3362
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I mentioned it in the chat

3363
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
do you remember and I'm not sure if I should say it

3364
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
why don't you type it

3365
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
we will not say it but if you type it in the chat

3366
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I will say it in gross disgusting audio

3367
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
okay

3368
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
does that ring a bell

3369
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
a little bit

3370
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
oh yeah a little bit

3371
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I'm not sure should I say it

3372
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I forget what it is

3373
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I don't know what that is yeah

3374
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
but it would

3375
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
oh

3376
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
oh that's right

3377
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
um I mean up to you dog

3378
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I don't know I think it's unlikely

3379
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
you'll actually do it personally but

3380
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
oh that sounds like a fucking challenge

3381
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I don't know I'm not sure if it's

3382
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I guess I would have to actually

3383
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
do some work and start like

3384
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
taking notes for it and like

3385
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
figure out whether it would make a good lecture

3386
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I agree

3387
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
but I find it personally compelling

3388
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
is the uh

3389
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
alright I'll just say it

3390
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I'll say it with the caveat that I

3391
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
guaranteeing that I will do it but it is on the table

3392
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
is um

3393
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
projared and holly conrad

3394
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
thing their whole affair and whatever

3395
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
it was predicated

3396
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
like they

3397
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
had characters in the same d&d campaign

3398
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and like this

3399
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
their characters in the game

3400
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
crossed over into real life because

3401
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
like they like

3402
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
the dimensional merge is literally real

3403
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
the dimensional merge took place it started with them

3404
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
they kicked it all off

3405
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Chris didn't know but this is what started it

3406
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
and because like

3407
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Heidi was like texting them and talking

3408
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
about their characters fucking which leads

3409
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
to the inevitable conclusion that they were doing

3410
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
like roleplay fucking in character

3411
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
as their d&d character and I thought

3412
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
it would be pretty funny to do a lecture

3413
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
doing like the history

3414
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
of their d&d characters

3415
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and like like where and all that

3416
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
and how this whole

3417
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
like the same way that like the

3418
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
sonichu lecture is talking about sonichu

3419
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
and in doing so

3420
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
you must discuss Chris

3421
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
this would be an in-character thing about the narrative

3422
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
of Diath and Strix

3423
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
and like who they are and what their story is

3424
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
and you know it would inevitably cross over

3425
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
into the real life

3426
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
story and I thought it was a funny idea

3427
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
it's a funny idea

3428
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I'm just curious about it

3429
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I think we spoke about this briefly but like

3430
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
did Jared's recent video where he

3431
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
made at least a pretty good comeback

3432
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
many people say it seems

3433
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
true to me too

3434
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
no I watch it I was just curious

3435
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
did that move the dial for you much

3436
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I already knew everything

3437
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
that he said in that video

3438
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
because like

3439
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I'd been following the story and like I talked to

3440
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Bedhead Bernie as he was making his

3441
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
he asked me for like my input on it and stuff

3442
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I see

3443
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
that was all stuff I already knew

3444
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
and I don't think it exonerates

3445
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I don't think Jared is like 100% exonerated

3446
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
of everything he did like I still think having

3447
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
like Nude's fan tumbler is gross

3448
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
but I do think that a lot of the stuff people

3449
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
were saying about him is like

3450
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
just like bad faith and wrong

3451
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
and should be

3452
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
and should be dismissed

3453
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I happen to watch H3's reaction to his new

3454
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
video I think earlier today and I have not

3455
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
man that boy was like he had said like

3456
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I had already dismissed the things

3457
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
because there was enough evidence but he was

3458
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
really mad at him for having this fan

3459
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
server thing

3460
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I will not defend the fan server

3461
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I don't well I defended the sense that it's legal

3462
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
but not in the sense of anything I would ever do

3463
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
yeah sure it's legal

3464
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
lots of gross things are legal

3465
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
that's true that's true

3466
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
fair enough

3467
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
but you know what I will say

3468
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
interestingly enough is that his wife

3469
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
at the time clearly knew about it

3470
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
and condoned it

3471
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
that's absolutely true

3472
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
let's not forget that if we're taking sides

3473
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
fair enough

3474
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
well shit let's go into our next voicemail

3475
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
let me get it right here

3476
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
okay this one is from

3477
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
our boy Mozilla Fennekin

3478
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
is writing it again now if I remember correctly

3479
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
did we just send him to jail last

3480
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I think we sent him because he was the one you had

3481
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
the human core guy right

3482
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
yeah he said that the most human core thing

3483
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
is having a toilet

3484
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
factually inactive

3485
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I just want to say

3486
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
completely debunked by the existence of pigs

3487
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
because pigs like

3488
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
a known fact about them is they always

3489
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
shit the furthest away

3490
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
in a specific place the furthest away from where they sleep

3491
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
and eat

3492
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
that's true but we found an article of like animals that do this

3493
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
animal latrines

3494
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
animal latrines is like a phenomenon in nature

3495
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
fucking idiot

3496
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
a lot of species do it

3497
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
let's see if he has any defense for himself

3498
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
okay go

3499
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
hey guys Mozilla fuckface here

3500
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
just taking a good shit I got on this litter box

3501
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I got for myself in voice jail

3502
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
you know I gotta say it's actually pretty nice in here

3503
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
there's literally no security in here whatsoever

3504
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
so I used my white girl privilege

3505
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
to ask to speak to the manager

3506
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
but there was no one around

3507
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
so I guess that means I'm the

3508
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
manager now

3509
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
anyway I've been rethinking this whole human core

3510
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
thing and I think it's super human core

3511
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
to be looking at drawings of people

3512
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
but they're not actually people

3513
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
and there's so many drawings that it looks

3514
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
like the not people are moving

3515
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
it just got me thinking uh what's

3516
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
your favorite anime hit me back I want

3517
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
to know more about what human core

3518
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
really is

3519
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
he's clearly having too easy

3520
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
a time in jail we gotta confiscate his

3521
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
litter box

3522
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
he's reveling in the attention he gets

3523
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
from being put in jail

3524
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
he's not okay

3525
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
we gotta send like what's the word

3526
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
isolation tank

3527
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
is the PCP hail

3528
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
yeah start the pcb hail in pcb jail

3529
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
let's see if he can pelt it with

3530
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
rocks of ice and shit

3531
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
all right uh moving on

3532
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
let's go to I don't know

3533
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
that I even have a favorite anime

3534
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
um I mean it's I don't know

3535
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
we're deliberately not answering this question

3536
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
we're deliberately not I mean you could

3537
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
but no it's I just maybe think like I don't know

3538
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
if I even have one I know bakumon

3539
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
is my favorite manga but I don't know if I have a favorite

3540
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
anime the thing about this question

3541
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
is that nobody asks it sincerely

3542
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
so I'm not gonna give a sincere answer

3543
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
exactly the right attitude looks like

3544
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I fucked up

3545
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
all right we go to in my PJ's

3546
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
by the freeway okay go

3547
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
all right

3548
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
so real quick wanted to go over

3549
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
some things that are more human

3550
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
core than just bathrooms

3551
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
or something like that yeah

3552
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
so we've got let's see

3553
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
there's

3554
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
sweating sweating to cool down

3555
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
human started doing it because

3556
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
they needed

3557
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
the evaporative cooling properties

3558
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
because they were endurance renters

3559
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
uh like they used it for

3560
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
hunting uh and so the only

3561
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
other animal that does it uh

3562
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
that sweats as much as we do to cool down

3563
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
our horses and uh

3564
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
really like we could

3565
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
do it better than them if you if you like

3566
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
trained to be an endurance runner you could

3567
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
outrun a horse um yeah wait

3568
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
what hippos also do it like over

3569
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
overall like for sunscreen so it's like not

3570
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
the same thing hippo's horse

3571
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
humans hmm yeah we also

3572
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
keep pets which is pretty human core

3573
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
um nothing else

3574
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
really keeps pets uh

3575
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
at least that I know of symbiotic relationships

3576
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
or a thing but like

3577
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
there's a type of toad that keeps spiders

3578
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
as a pet think about it

3579
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
uh also munchy I'm an RA uh just so you know

3580
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
um if you want your

3581
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
RA to hate you just don't be the loud dorm

3582
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
or the one that smells like weed

3583
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
uh yeah that's about it

3584
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
adios

3585
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
do you say frogs keep spiders as pets

3586
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
there there's I've seen an image

3587
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
of a little toad and like it on a blog

3588
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
a while ago and it was really cute

3589
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
uh there's either it was a large

3590
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
toad that kept

3591
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
like a small tarantula as a pet

3592
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
that would eat bugs and bring it to him

3593
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
or it was a large tarantula that kept a tiny

3594
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
toad as a pet um

3595
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I don't know I don't know the situation

3596
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
but they both eat the same thing

3597
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
so I suppose there's just sort of like

3598
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
you know their buddies

3599
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
like like the tarantula drains the fluids

3600
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
out of it and then he gives like the husks to the frog

3601
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
something something of that nature

3602
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
like they they both hunt the same thing

3603
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
and like one is fed with the thing

3604
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
or it might be like the toad utilizes

3605
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
the spider's web

3606
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
something strange and funny super cool

3607
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
uh but the domestication of animals

3608
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
is pretty human okay I

3609
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
yeah I feel like there's a lot of misunderstanding to me

3610
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
okay just something that humans do

3611
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
is not human core sweating

3612
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
yeah I know humans sweat and we are

3613
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
not many other animals sweat like we do

3614
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
that doesn't that's not human core

3615
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
human core action is an action

3616
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
that humans are driven to do

3617
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
for no other for no

3618
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
like good purpose

3619
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
that does not serve any end so like

3620
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
the domestication of animals I would not say

3621
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
is strictly human core because animals are domesticated

3622
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
for like practical purposes

3623
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
but like keeping like house cats

3624
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
or something or keeping like keeping

3625
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
pets just for fun like that's human core

3626
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I definitely agree

3627
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I definitely agree yeah

3628
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
is fun is having fun

3629
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
for fun sake human core

3630
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
dogs play though

3631
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
then again we made dogs

3632
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
by humans so like we shaped them in our image

3633
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
maybe a little bit you know in our image

3634
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
yes you guys ever you guys ever just have

3635
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
a moment where you're like what the fuck

3636
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
is this podcast that I'm on

3637
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
um yes because

3638
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
that's all I feel when I'm hearing

3639
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
well you know humans are the only

3640
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
people who sweat but also horses

3641
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
sweat so I guess it's not totally giving

3642
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
a lecture on like what animals sweat out of

3643
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
their buttholes or whatever and I'm just sitting here

3644
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
like how did I get

3645
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
we're just doing what screen ranted we have to come

3646
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
up with catchphrases to engage our audience

3647
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
and human core is one of them so we've

3648
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
got to be scattershot and just say shit

3649
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
like I found it interesting that

3650
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
hey guys and hippos are all lumped

3651
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
together in one or else

3652
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I'm just being cool

3653
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
we're the reason people are dying

3654
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
you know what what was that

3655
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
cool catchphrase I came up with the other day

3656
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
I can't quite it was something like

3657
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000

famous catchphrase

02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I'm gonna work that into every conversation

3663
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
this podcast is no overall theme

3664
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000

02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
for this so I want to say

3679
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
two to three years ago

3680
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
when Alex Jones was like more of a

3681
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
big meme you know there's really

3682
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
there's really popular clip going around

3683
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I noticed as a young lad

3684
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
back in high school

3685
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
he said something kind of insane

3686
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
you know he said

3687
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
the water is turning the frickin

3688
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
frogs gay

3689
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
he thought that was a pretty insane statement

3690
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
at the time right

3691
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
you know back in the day

3692
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
fast forward

3693
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
a year or two

3694
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
senior year in high school for me

3695
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I take a zoology class

3696
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
okay

3697
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
study of animals and stuff

3698
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
and I gotta say

3699
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
it's

3700
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
fucking true

3701
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
the water is turning the frickin

3702
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
frogs gay

3703
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I don't remember exactly what it is

3704
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
but we had a guest come into our zoology class

3705
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
who explained something

3706
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
about like how chemicals in the water

3707
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
legitimately turns

3708
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
frogs into like hermaphrodites

3709
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
okay this is the worst voicemail I've ever heard

3710
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
and it was insane it was like the most

3711
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
insane revelation for me

3712
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
like last year with me

3713
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
and my friends we were like

3714
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
holy shit

3715
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
this sucks really bad

3716
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
seriously

3717
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
that's garbage

3718
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
we all know

3719
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
a lot of frogs are naturally hermaphroditic

3720
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I mean that's literally the plot of Jurassic Park

3721
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
it's literally not

3722
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
the same thing as being gay

3723
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
so there's no connection here

3724
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
man

3725
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
there was so much build up

3726
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I knew exactly where this was going

3727
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
the moment I heard his name

3728
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
and frankly I'm shocked and appalled

3729
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I had suspicions

3730
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
people put so much

3731
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
emphasis on stuff that Alex Jones says

3732
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
like he's so crazy

3733
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
he's the modern day Nostradamus

3734
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
people just

3735
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
you know he clearly has

3736
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
a sense of humor

3737
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
he does exaggerate these things

3738
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
he is on some level being funny

3739
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
when he says stuff like

3740
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
the water's turning the frickin frogs gay

3741
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
he's not a totally sincere

3742
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
he's just exaggerating for

3743
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
comedic effect

3744
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
he's saying that there's bad chemicals

3745
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
and pollution that are messing up the environment

3746
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
but he's saying it in a funny way

3747
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
and everyone takes it completely seriously

3748
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
because people are literally

3749
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
much stupider than Alex Jones

3750
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
this guy could

3751
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
have done a little bit of research

3752
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
to find out what he was talking about

3753
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
but instead

3754
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
he just says hey guys

3755
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
remember a guy told me one time

3756
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
that this thing was sort of

3757
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
adjacent to true and I can't

3758
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
elaborate on that at all but isn't that crazy guys

3759
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
no

3760
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
it sounds like the problem here

3761
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
is the conflation between hermaphroditic

3762
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
and gay

3763
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
that's a problem

3764
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
it's just the old plot point

3765
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
from Jurassic Park where they're like

3766
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
we had some missing building blocks of the DNA

3767
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
so we used frog DNA but then Ellie Sadler

3768
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
was like oh but some of the frogs can turn hermaphroditic

3769
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
but all the dinosaurs are female

3770
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
but then some of the life finds a way

3771
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
he says Jeff Goldblum and then they fucking

3772
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
the hermaphroditic frog DNA

3773
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
makes them into penises and they have

3774
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
dinosaur babies damn it

3775
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
that's everyone knows that shit

3776
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
wow that's like

3777
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
biology 101

3778
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
okay well whatever

3779
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
fuck that guy next one

3780
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
we got Mr. Bones speaking of bone

3781
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
here's Mr. Bones old friend

3782
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
okay go

3783
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
what's up my n words

3784
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Mr. Bones here

3785
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
call me because I wanted to pick your brains

3786
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
about streaming

3787
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
we've seen renowned creators like

3788
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Demo D star and German

3789
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
move to twitch and leave their youtube channels

3790
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
to gather dust

3791
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
most of you have been involved with streaming to some extent

3792
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
so I'd just like to know

3793
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
if you'd ever think of transitioning from your current

3794
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
style of content to mostly streaming

3795
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
it is ostensibly

3796
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
quicker and easier and makes more money

3797
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
so I can see the appeal

3798
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
but is it something you do full time

3799
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
as your main source of content

3800
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
also on top of that question

3801
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I'd like to give you some warm congratulations

3802
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
on the last episode of the PCP

3803
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
which managed to not have a 20 minute political

3804
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
shitfest sandwiched somewhere in the middle

3805
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
you're welcome Mr. Bones

3806
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I'm going to treat my vile layer now

3807
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
slice and dice brothers

3808
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I have

3809
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
people seem to start people are starting

3810
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
to notice in the comments finally

3811
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
that

3812
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
when Jesse is on the podcast

3813
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
magically it seems to be much

3814
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
much better every single time

3815
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
and that when he's

3816
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
off the podcast for long stretches of time

3817
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
everything just slowly

3818
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
devolves into shit

3819
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
it's all about you Jesse

3820
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
these Jesse stands in the comments have got to go

3821
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
it's all tribalism

3822
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
yeah

3823
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
and my tribe needs to win

3824
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
to the guy's question though

3825
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
so the thing about

3826
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
I think about streaming like this

3827
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I almost feel like streaming

3828
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
take H3HB for example

3829
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
you have to build up a reason

3830
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
for people to give a shit about you

3831
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
and that needs to be done with

3832
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
projects that matter

3833
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
things you do that influence people

3834
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
and then you can coast off that

3835
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
by streaming

3836
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I don't think that's necessarily true

3837
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I don't know if anyone has just gotten

3838
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
famous purely through streaming

3839
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
on Twitch

3840
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
but nobody's famous

3841
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
for that initially

3842
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
are they?

3843
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
absolutely

3844
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Ninja was a big just came out

3845
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
he was a Fortnite streamer

3846
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
but there must have been something about Ninja

3847
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
that made people gravitate to him other than

3848
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
just the fact that he streamed on Twitch

3849
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
no that literally is it

3850
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
there is more

3851
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
he was a literal competitive

3852
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
to semi-professional

3853
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
if you go on Twitch

3854
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
and you just search for the game that you're interested in

3855
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
and a guy comes up that's how you

3856
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
find people on Twitch

3857
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
YouTube does not have a monopoly on discovering people

3858
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
though it is easier

3859
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
well

3860
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I follow this guy

3861
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
T90

3862
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
who was a Twitch streamer

3863
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
who does commentary over

3864
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
people doing

3865
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
competitive Age of Empires 2

3866
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
things

3867
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
unironically incredibly engaging

3868
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
and I love it

3869
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
it's my favorite game

3870
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
but at a super high level

3871
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
and his streams are good

3872
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
I don't watch his streams

3873
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
but he started uploading to YouTube

3874
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
and now I know him as a YouTuber

3875
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
where he uploads entire streams

3876
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
or entire matches

3877
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
from his streams

3878
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
you can easily go from one to the other

3879
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
he didn't do anything before Twitch

3880
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
there was just a guy who got popular

3881
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
because he was good at what he did

3882
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
and he did a game where there was a strong

3883
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
community

3884
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
the only reason I'd like

3885
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
right now

3886
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
my Twitch is basically like an interaction

3887
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
vehicle for people who are interested

3888
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
and then also like an excuse to play some games

3889
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
and do bantery stuff

3890
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
so like it's fun but it's not my prime focus

3891
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I could theoretically see myself in theory

3892
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
becoming a full-time streamer

3893
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
for example if

3894
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
was gratifying to do

3895
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and was creatively

3896
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
fulfilling in some way

3897
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
and also made sense financially

3898
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
if that was the case I'd consider it

3899
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
but I feel like I'm always going to want to do

3900
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
like right now I'm doing a lot of

3901
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Viagra's

3902
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
what I want to be doing all day

3903
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
is editing fancy big videos

3904
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
that I have a little bit of time for

3905
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I'm working on fixing my schedule and stuff

3906
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
but this is what I passionately want to do

3907
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
so that's always going to be there

3908
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
and that's why I fucking quit my computer science job

3909
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
everybody fucking programming job

3910
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
like if I'm just going to do a job

3911
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
that's not like better than that

3912
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
that's just equally just fill in time

3913
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
and be in a drag and just got to put in the hours in

3914
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
like I could just do my much better

3915
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
paying programming job

3916
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
so I got to make us you know

3917
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I think I started

3918
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I see streaming as like

3919
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
kind of a yeah I wouldn't want to do it

3920
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
full-time it doesn't seem

3921
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
it's not very creatively fulfilling

3922
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
and I kind of just see it as like

3923
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
a time during the week when I can like

3924
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
interact with like you know

3925
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
the people in my discord and stuff

3926
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
because like I'm in my discord a bit but I'm not like

3927
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I'm not like chatting a whole lot in there

3928
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
just here and there so I feel like that's

3929
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
my time when like people who want to

3930
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
you know interact with me

3931
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
or people who like

3932
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
you know are in you know

3933
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
my extended community or whatever

3934
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
who like maybe just want to like touch

3935
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
base with all like that like that's the time

3936
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
when I do that and it makes a bit of

3937
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
money be just because I think some people like

3938
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
you know have twitch bits that they

3939
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
you know certain people prefer different

3940
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
platforms and some people want to

3941
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
would rather donate through twitch with bits

3942
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
or something than they would through I don't know

3943
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
patreon or kofi or whatever

3944
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and you know that's it's you know it's

3945
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
that's another reason to do it to diversify

3946
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
your platforms so

3947
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
I guess my short answer is no

3948
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I don't want to do it like I wouldn't

3949
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
transition and I don't

3950
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
I don't know if it makes more money

3951
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I don't know this Mr. Bones

3952
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
you know with all due respect

3953
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Mr. Bone I don't know if you can say that twitch

3954
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
just makes more money I mean for some people I'm sure it does

3955
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
but it's definitely not the case for everybody

3956
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
that twitch is like a more

3957
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
lucrative thing

3958
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
from what I understand to be big

3959
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
on twitch you need to stream like

3960
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
every second of every day of your life

3961
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
yeah so like

3962
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
the like the workload floor

3963
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
is incredibly high but at that

3964
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
floor the pay is a lot better

3965
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
than youtube so like

3966
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
most people on twitch

3967
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
for like I mean they're working the long hours

3968
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
but they're working like not very hard

3969
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
like comparatively like

3970
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
they're not being an editor and a director

3971
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
and a and a voice over

3972
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
guy or whatever they're not animating anything

3973
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
to be in a fucking stream it is it is

3974
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
pretty exhausting but like

3975
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
there's the yeah you said obstin obstin

3976
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
obstincibly and I think that's the word

3977
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
that's correct it's obstincibly

3978
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
better money

3979
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
on youtube

3980
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I feel like the workload floor is

3981
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
much lower

3982
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
but the

3983
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
the point of which

3984
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
you can be successful

3985
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
by not doing that much work

3986
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
or like putting in the hours

3987
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I'm trying to think of a

3988
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
like a phrase for this

3989
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
off the top of my head

3990
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
like if you get a viral hit or something

3991
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I don't know

3992
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
like I don't know what people

3993
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
viral on twitch in the same way

3994
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
not really

3995
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
they have to be like even ninja

3996
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I know was like

3997
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
streaming for a long time and then

3998
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
suddenly like like sort of

3999
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
exponential growth because of

4000
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
algorithm or whatever it was over there

4001
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
like you just he was playing the right game

4002
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
of the right time and

4003
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
everybody shared him with everybody else

4004
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
and then you became the biggest thing on twitch

4005
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
um but

4006
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
uh

4007
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I forgot the point I was making

4008
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
I'm still with my boy Dr. Disrespect

4009
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
his production values are insane

4010
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I think everything

4011
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
there's one great streamer it's Dr. Disrespect

4012
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
he has changed the fucking game I'm so

4013
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
impressed I don't watch it that often I did

4014
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
for a little bit I mean I think that you

4015
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I think that streaming can be

4016
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
you know a creative medium

4017
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
and can be just fulfilling

4018
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
when Dr. Disrespect works

4019
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
for I'm sure he works with editors and like people

4020
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
preparing stuff and they like make a really

4021
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
cool effect that he will unveil

4022
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
like at some point like like him I told

4023
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
the story before about like I was watching he press

4024
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
the button boom camera transitions

4025
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
now it's like it's literally him

4026
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
like standing small he's not he stands

4027
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
up out of his chair now it's like he's like

4028
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
shoved into obviously green screen

4029
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
thing where there's a skyscraper it's him

4030
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
walking out onto a helipad on top

4031
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
of a skyscraper in a big city

4032
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
and he's just like on his headset now you can

4033
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
see him like small in the corner next was helicopter

4034
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
with like twitch HQ it's it's like

4035
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
basically New Los Angeles City

4036
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
in the fucking background and he's just like

4037
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
yeah you know just made another million just close the deal

4038
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
just you know doing some sponsorship gigs

4039
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
just you know make another billion dollars

4040
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
on the on the market today that is what is

4041
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
and then he presses another fucking button

4042
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and he goes back to his gamer chair and it's like

4043
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I when he's there's a

4044
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
lot of work involved for sure in

4045
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
preparing those things

4046
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
then there's like when he's

4047
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
on when he's actually streaming wherever he can like

4048
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
push a button and boom unveils this really cool

4049
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
thing that he's prepared and then he you know

4050
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
goes on but the meat and potatoes of

4051
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
it is him sitting in front of a

4052
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
camera and pause is standing up occasionally

4053
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
and just like saying shit being funny

4054
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
telling jokes and like playing

4055
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
games for like you know I don't know five

4056
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
six eight hours a day whatever it is

4057
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I don't know a schedule and that

4058
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
could definitely be taxing and doesn't

4059
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
really sound that fun I don't know

4060
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
yeah I don't know

4061
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I like me I wouldn't want to you know

4062
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
you're a full-time streamer you know you're basically

4063
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
doing what you do at an office job which is sitting

4064
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
in a chair yeah for you know

4065
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
doing it seems and like

4066
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
at least you like you can slack off

4067
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
you can slack off at an office

4068
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
if you're like on twitch you have to be

4069
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
like engaging the entire time

4070
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
well you don't really have to be engaging the entire

4071
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
time you know

4072
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
like people people definitely

4073
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
put it on in the background

4074
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
and they're not you know there's no

4075
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
there's no like

4076
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
culture of being incensed when somebody

4077
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
isn't on their A game because everybody

4078
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
understands that if you if you

4079
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
you know it's just sort of like a window

4080
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
like you look over to the window

4081
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
and there's like a thing there and it's always there

4082
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
and it's reliable and you like it and you subscribe

4083
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
and you like and favor it because

4084
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
you like looking at in that window and if they're not

4085
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
there for even one second you go

4086
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
you go crazy but if you look there and they're there

4087
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
it doesn't really matter how

4088
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
well they're doing you're just

4089
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
it's just sort of like a I don't know what it is

4090
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
oh oh

4091
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
about about twitch okay

4092
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
so I think I don't I think maybe

4093
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I want to do this after

4094
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I think maybe I might

4095
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
announce my plan to do this

4096
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
in

4097
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
sonichu lecture number two sonichu

4098
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,000
102 advanced

4099
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
history is what I'm planning to call it

4100
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
but like after that like you know

4101
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
a philosophy tube did his like

4102
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
reading the entire works of Shakespeare

4103
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
right for charity I kind

4104
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
of want to do a charity stream where I read through the entirety

4105
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
of sonichu

4106
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
do you think it would take a lot of tape hard

4107
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
to say it might

4108
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
be a long time like

4109
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
it could

4110
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I mean some chapters would probably take

4111
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
several hours

4112
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
as if I'm not like blasting through I might

4113
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
take like 10 15 20 I don't

4114
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I don't know that would take that long but I could see

4115
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
it taking like a huge a long time

4116
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I don't but I want to do a charity

4117
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
stream first but I don't know what charity

4118
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I would do it for I would

4119
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
we would want to be something funny

4120
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
patreon.com

4121
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
all good ideas

4122
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I'm sure you could find one

4123
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
and you know in the time to

4124
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
not autism speaks because everyone says that's a bad charity

4125
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
lol okay fair enough

4126
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
fair enough

4127
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I don't know dog

4128
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
just

4129
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I like the idea yeah that's

4130
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
something I want to do

4131
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
and that is a twitch a twitch plan

4132
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
yeah that's kind of what I want

4133
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
like I know inevitably I will

4134
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
do another nuzlocke and people are going

4135
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
bananas they want another nuzlocke

4136
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I mean the last one was a triumph

4137
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
it was a success I like by far my most

4138
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
lucrative streams as well because people want to be

4139
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
those Pokemon so like

4140
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
it's definitely what I will do eventually

4141
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I just gotta just gotta carve out some time lads

4142
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
because that last one really ate into

4143
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
my schedule of like we Aga was

4144
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
and other stuff yeah

4145
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
did a lot of work behind the scenes

4146
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
yeah they did they did it was good

4147
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
time and I had a lot of fun like preparing

4148
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
like the god fight against you know Ben saint

4149
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000

4150
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000

4155
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
yeah I like I like twitch

4156
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I think it's cool I don't want

4157
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I don't want to be a full-time streamer but I

4158
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000

02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
