00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Poopcast.

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm the best Poop ever. I'm joined by Mumkey Poop, Munchy wears tiny craps, Ghostbusters

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:11,640
2 is better than Ghostbusters 1, also I like Poop. So today, as you can tell, we're talking

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,920
about a very serious topic. One day we have to do the Poopcast, but for now, we need to

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,200
don't see the smoke when the person exhales. Now that's a ghost. Oh god, I love you Urban

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Dictionary. What about Ghost Poop? Do they have Ghost Poop on there when you let out a

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,800
turd and then you look in the toilet and you can't see it? You can't see it. No, none

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,600
of this. Oh, but you know, Mumkey, you were right. Number two was Ghost to avoid someone

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,920
until they get the picture and stop contacting you. So that's basically what you were talking

10
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,600
about. We've all been there. Of course. So we're dealing mostly with number one here,

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,280
Ghost. I thought it would be dealing with number two. Plop. Where's Jesse when you need

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,320
him? Ghost, the Discarnate. Discarnate? I guess that's a word. Soul of a deceased human

13
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,240
being or animal. Or animal. We're dealing with animal ghosts. Still occupying the physical

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,840
realm. These spirits may or may not know that they are dead. They can also be called forth.

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,600
They can also be part of the definition. Oh my god. Oh wait, wait. Okay, number two. There's

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,960
like four definitions for this. Number two is residuals. Residuals is a ghost, I guess.

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,080
Okay. Number three, a demon, angel, saint, or Christ himself. Jesus is the most powerful

18
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,840
ghost, no demand. And number four, a poltergeist. Okay, there you go. We're like a polter cost.

19
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
Like a holocaust ghost, like a ghost of Auschwitz. Okay, cool. Wait, so who wins in a fight? Danny

20
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:27,760
Phantom or Jesus Christ? Are we going to record that right after this? I think we probably

21
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,520
should. I think while we're in the mood. Well, I'm down to clown for that. Okay, we're going

22
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,120
to go ghost. So, I mean, how should we just talk about that right away? Because actually,

23
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,560
we had planted a ghost episode before some recent events transpired, but there's sort

24
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,680
of a new context to discussing ghosts and going ghosts, you know, in today, the news.

25
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,680
So I don't know if you folks have subscribed to a little channel called Mumky Jones, but

26
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,800
I mean, I know it's not very popular. It's not very well liked, but it's not at all.

27
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,680
So there was a mass shooting recently by, what's the dude's name, Mr. Staircase? Yeah,

28
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Randy Staircase. That's right. Randy Staircase, a silly boy, decided that he was going to...

29
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,080
Yep, that's what he is. He's a very silly boy. For some reason, I'm sorry, I miss gendering

30
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,920
him. He identifies as a woman. He identifies as a female ghost because he loves Ember from

31
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,520
Danny Phantom so much. So at some point with logic, I didn't quite follow. He then decided

32
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,080
it would be a good idea to shoot up the supermarket that he works at and he killed like three people

33
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,200
and then himself and he went ghost. He has gone ghost now. So I guess we should discuss

34
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,520
our plans to do so as well, you know, like when we'll be also going ghosts to join Ember's

35
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,200
sick band and remember the name. What do you think, Mumky? When's your plans for that?

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,120
Well, first of all, I don't think this should have been a surprise to anybody about his

37
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,680
mental state because he was a diehard brony. So we already knew he was mentally unstable

38
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,600
and a childish. But as far as me going ghost one day, oh buddy, unfortunately I don't plan

39
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,280
on taking other people out with me like Mr. Staircase did. I'll probably end up going

40
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,280
ghost in my bedroom closet with a noose. My question is, when we all go ghost, what ghost

41
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,120
activities are we all going to partake in together? Are we going to do a PCP ghost?

42
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,160
Like a ghost version of the PCP where we're all recording a podcast as ghosts?

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
Yeah, I think so. With ghost microphones and ghost wires.

44
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,960
To the ghost internet, which is like they're drawing a new book for ghosts.

45
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,920
Yeah, right. That makes a lot of sense. But Digi will be too much of a pussy to kill himself

46
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,960
now that he has all that money, so he'll have to join in via Ouija board.

47
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,440
That'll be a good way to bring in our patrons, our patron supporters who give us real money.

48
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,760
We communicate via Ouija board. We only need ghost money at that point.

49
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,040
As for what I'm going to do when I'm a ghost, two words buddy, global warming. I'm going to

50
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,400
think global warming is real and it happens swiftly. I'm going to put all my power into

51
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,440
warming up the atmosphere with my ghost body. How does being a ghost do that?

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm just going to get up in there and I'm going to be all spiritual and shit and it's going to

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,560
just happen bro. If you're trying to turn up the heat, I've got the ghost for you.

54
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Okay, we got the song out of the way. I just turned all our audience to ghost. That was painful.

55
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm running out of steam on this Ember trick. So maybe we should actually go to our ghost

56
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,480
stories because we are going to, I think like the general through line here is we're going to talk

57
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,200
about our views on ghosts themselves and then yeah. This is one of our ghost stories and my

58
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,320
Ghostbusters 2 is the best movie ever made. So should we start with what we think about ghosts,

59
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,600
our beliefs in ghosts and all that shit. I'm just going to start off saying that ghosts are

60
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,120
literally not real and there is no, they are 100% do not exist. If you think so, you are a fool.

61
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,320
And any explanation for a quote unquote supernatural event that you think could be

62
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,040
attributed to the supernatural is a billion times more likely to be caused by some sort of

63
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,080
physical phenomenon that you just aren't aware of or don't understand. So are you really prepared

64
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,200
people to like invent a whole nether world as the explanation for why like your chair shook

65
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,000
once as opposed to, I don't know, fucking tectonic plateshifting dude. I don't fucking know.

66
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Nate, are you talking about ghosts or about the Christianity religion?

67
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,040
Well, you know, they're related. They're kind of really souls. We just said Jesus was a ghost.

68
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Jesus Christ is the most powerful ghost. Here's my case. Ghosts aren't real, but they should be.

69
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,120
And I'm willing to, I need to become a statesman. I need to study the art of statecraft so I can

70
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,720
get into president and I can use my executive power to make ghosts real. I'm 100% behind you on

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,680
this one, dude. Right. Every time that I remember that ghosts aren't real, I want to kill myself

72
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,360
so I can become the first ghost and start the first ghost nation because every every like

73
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,560
ghosts are the only thing that I think matter in real life because they're fake and fake things aka

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,880
are better than real things because they're fake and ghosts are fake. That's my logic. You know,

75
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,080
before we get to off track, I did want to ask. So like Randy Stairs, right? Was he, did he actually

76
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,560
like believe in ghosts? Was he like, did he think that Danny Phantom was real? Like, what was his

77
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,520
headspace at? So he legitimately thought that upon death, you would enter the ghost zone from

78
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,960
Danny Phantom where you could be and do whatever you want. I mean, that sounds really cool. And

79
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,840
that's pretty much Christianity there. That's what I want, bro. That's what I want. The great thing

80
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,560
about the, the great thing about the ghost zone is that unlike with Christianity, you can commit

81
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,040
suicide and still go there unlike in Christianity, which has that annoying clause of you have to keep

82
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,360
living and paying, you know, dividends to the church. Right. When I'm a ghost, all I want to do

83
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,720
is heat up the earth, cause global warming and you know, maybe fuck a few star systems while I'm

84
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,200
at it. Not anyone in it, but in the solar system. What's up hippo buddy? Hello. Oh, I hope you enjoy

85
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,880
Doctor Who, you fucking non-ghost. Yeah, piece of shit. You fucking physical form being. Yeah, we

86
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,200
started. Yeah, we fucking started. We started on time, goddamn you. Why weren't you? Yeah. I don't know.

87
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Well, fuck you. If you're lucky that Major was having mic issues or you'd be, you'd be shit dead. Oh,

88
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,120
yeah. Ghost, you'd have gotten ghost right now. Oh, no. Would I kick Major off by coming in? Oh,

89
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,680
my God, you left so many messages. She had technical issues. Yeah, that was some of me

90
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:48,680
spamming that hypocrite. Yeah, we almost got Jeff in here. The ghost of the PCP.

91
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Well, okay, what else we got? Gib, what do you think about ghosts? Tell me what you think about

92
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:03,560
ghosts. I think they're pretty cool, but they're, you know, they're not real and that's pretty,

93
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,840
that's basically a real, you agree that they should. Okay, okay. I believe in the dream bubbles. Yes.

94
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,120
What if a ghost fought a skeleton? Who's more powerful between you? A skeleton, of course. A

95
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,440
skeleton is a raggedy, dingley, dingley dangoy. He's got little rattly bones and he can play

96
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,760
xylophone and impress them into, into disaparating them. Like, you can't, you can't destroy a skeleton.

97
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,240
He just puts himself back together. A ghost you can put into a vacuum, it just, they're just,

98
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,240
there's just so much worse. Well, okay, I don't know about that because while skeletons do have

99
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,480
that raw physical manpower and then that raw horsepower and the unbridled consensual sexual

100
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,560
ability that skeletons possess, you know, at whim. Ghosts, they can cause global warming.

101
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,720
They can walk through walls, disappear and fly. They're much more unique than the other guys.

102
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,560
Yeah. And. Who's ever knew what he had to do to stop all the ghosts out of coming through?

103
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,360
He's here to fight for me. Not only that, but they cause slime, the most important thing a man

104
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,120
could ever drink. I'm so glad you brought up the ectoplasm thing because I really want to get deep

105
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,400
into ectoplasm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Basically, all I think about is ectoplasm. This is where my love

106
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,600
of slime comes from. Really? Is that the genesis of your slime love? Say that again?

107
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Is that really the genesis of your slime love? This is deep lore. Yes, exactly. Exactly. One time,

108
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,640
you know, I thought about ghosts and I thought, oh man, I love slime. Just like that. Yeah, oh man.

109
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:45,320
Slime. Yeah, slime. Slime. I hate slime, dude. I don't like slip and slide and I don't like soap.

110
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,840
I don't claim myself. It's disgusting. Why would you even give a low-crash coffee? I want to try out

111
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,840
my whole skin. I want my skin and organs and blood to drain away so I can become a skeleton,

112
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,920
the driest, bestest friend you could ever be. Oh my god. A skeleton versus ghosts is like yin and

113
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,920
yang. It's like the ultimate slime versus the ultimate not slime. The ultimate drive. Drive versus

114
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,800
slime. Drive versus white. Can someone clarify for this for me? Okay, so do ghosts produce ectoplasm?

115
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,160
Like when they touch, then there's goop there. Or is like ectoplasm like what a ghost is? It's what

116
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:28,440
you make when you see a ghost. Okay, what it is is like ghosts are not of a material of this world.

117
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,440
So when they try and interact with like a physical object, like a wall or something,

118
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,280
then like they're like atoms fuck up the real world and not imaginary things. And they turn

119
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,520
into fucking slime, which you think can then turn into a delectable drink and then drink and then

120
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,640
turn into a super Saiyan yourself. So you're telling me, okay, so ectoplasm is kind of like a

121
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,600
waste byproduct of a ghost's existence in the physical plane. Is that correct? Exactly. Yeah.

122
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Okay, awesome. Awesome. In Danny Phantom. Slimer is literally me. He's literally me. There's not a

123
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,000
single more character that is more like me than Slimer. When you look at Slimer, you just think,

124
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,800
yep, that's munchy. If you were to try and argue that Slimer is not me, I think you'd be way off

125
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
base and you'd probably be wrong on every level. I think Slimer should make a cameo in My Little

126
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,760
Pony. I'm just throwing that out there. Oh, remember that one time Curry made an appearance of My Little Pony?

127
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,160
He was a little pony, My Little Pony. That was a slime character in episode something or other

128
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,400
season six. Oh, Hugh Jelly. Hugh Jelly was a slime boy, right? Yeah, dude, Hugh Jelly.

129
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,360
There was a literal slime guy and he came to the party and he had a little bow tie.

130
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,440
I don't remember that. He was a friend of Discord. You're a little My Little Pony

131
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,160
faggot. You don't even know. Oh, no. Okay. So can we all agree that we don't believe

132
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,000
that ghosts are real? Yes. Are you on board with that? I'm 100% on board. But they're all great.

133
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,080
Okay, so has anybody interacted with people who legitimately think that

134
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,400
they do? And if so, what's the story? Because I have several people in my life.

135
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I do as well. Go for it, Tom. Yeah, Tom. Yeah, you should talk.

136
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,040
I don't know. I mean, just like I come from like a spiritual household, like, you know,

137
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,040
people in my house, they believe in religion and all that stuff. And ghosts, I guess they're a part

138
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,320
of that. And it's interesting because like I talk with my dad a lot because we both work in that

139
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,680
abandoned building where like 100 people have died and there's like pseudo crazy shit that goes on

140
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,280
that place all the time. And like there I've had experiences that most people would attribute to

141
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,200
ghosts. But I know it's just like my primitive monkey brain having having a overreaction.

142
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:45,240
What's that supposed to mean? Well, I mean, I'm not taking it back. So you're just gonna have to deal

143
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,720
with it. I didn't fight alongside you in the great monkey war for this whole shit.

144
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,440
Well, yeah, I mean, so like, you know, my dad's kind of more of a spiritual guy. So he will say

145
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,400
like, oh, yeah, there's definitely like ghosts and stuff in there. It was like, and I'm just like,

146
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,840
no, I think it's probably just my my my brain freaking out on me. But I did have a weird

147
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,640
experience there a couple days ago. And I was I knew it was just like, yes, it's me just freaking

148
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,680
out. But it definitely felt like, you know, it's interesting how like the things line up. So

149
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,760
just like, oh, yeah, it feels like there's something going on, even though they're totally sure. So

150
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,640
he was really good at pattern recognition. It's our biggest flaw. Yep. Yep. Because it makes us

151
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,640
think things that aren't actually true. And then it becomes as big intercontinental religion. And

152
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,960
then people lose all their money. And it's bad. And that's how Jesus the ghost came to be.

153
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah, the losing of the money is bad. But it's it's the worst. Forget going. Well, I know, I know,

154
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,560
I don't know anybody who actually like believes believes in it. You know, as far as I know,

155
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,280
I feel like the people who say they think about ghosts, they just, you know, they're having fun

156
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,640
there and a bit of like, oh, I wonder what that could have been. Well, you know, you'd be wrong

157
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,160
because my dad thinks he's seen a ghost before. Okay, you know, right. I mean, I kind of I'll

158
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,760
talk about a story with my dad, too. That's not specifically about ghosts, but it's kind of relevant.

159
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,120
But like the thing about the thing about believing in things that you don't know are real, like I

160
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,440
don't really have a problem on its face with believing in ghosts if you just like want to.

161
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,280
But the thing is, like, what I think what you're actually doing when you like allow yourself to

162
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,520
believe that stuff is you're like, allowing yourself to be like intellectually lazy, and you're

163
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,080
just like assuming something that you don't know is true. And like, you're encouraging within yourself

164
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,800
a pattern of behavior to just like believe things without proper evidence for them. And like, that's

165
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,240
what I object to that kind of like intellectual laziness. I don't know if I go that far evidence.

166
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,800
They think that they've seen evidence. I think they're wrong. I think the thing about about ghosts

167
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,480
is I think people just like it's the same thing with like aliens and all that kind of paranormal

168
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,880
shit. I think it's just fun. Yeah, exactly. I think it's just fun to to. It's fun to believe in

169
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:03,080
God. Well, it is. It is fun for forever. I think it's just people looking for comfort and for

170
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,880
religion. It's definitely a come more of a comfort thing. But I think for like ghosts and like

171
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,040
Bigfoot and like all that kind of shit. I think it's just fun to think that there's more to the

172
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,080
world than what we figured out, you know, that have this a mystery left in our otherwise predictable

173
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,320
and mundane existence. You know, I'm totally cool with that. And I okay, go ahead. Go ahead. I just

174
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:26,280
want to say I love how fucking terrifying God is like he's the scariest fucking guy. I'm so scared

175
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,000
of the ultimate ghost sending me to fucking hell. It's it's real fun. Are you going to join us for

176
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,520
the bonus episode we're doing who wins Danny Phantom versus Jesus? Yeah, yeah. Okay, you can

177
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,440
decide that later. But you know, the thing you know, Christopher Hitchens always had a great

178
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,200
line I loved about God, which is just or not, you know, about like Christianity in general,

179
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,040
where it's like Christianity is like, oh, no, he might have been about Islam, but it's all kind

180
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,200
of the same thing. Any monotheistic religion, they're all like they are, it's like you and these

181
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,720
people who like are all about it and like are so happy that they have God watching over them,

182
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,120
and then judging them if they should go to heaven or hell. It's like wanting to live in a

183
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,640
celestial North Korea, where like all your your inner thoughts are judged at every moment. And if

184
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,520
you go against the great leader and what he has decided is correct. That's you like you're gonna

185
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,440
fucking go to hell and people who are like, yeah, God, he's got my back. That's you being like, yes,

186
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,520
treat me like a slave, treat me like an unthinking automaton. That's what I want. And I don't even

187
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,040
believe in free will, but these people claim to and so they're really going against their own

188
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,760
fucking message here. But forget that, Tom, please continue. Wait, wait, just to interject

189
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,760
here real quick, because I think it's really important. You know, I was a non-believer a

190
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,680
couple days ago, you know, I didn't believe in the holy book, the good book that is. And my name

191
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,280
wasn't in the book of life, but ever since I was called an abomination yesterday, and I was gifted

192
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,440
Titanic and The Peacemaker, my two favorite Marvel DC comic books, I hope get him meditation

193
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,920
soon. I'm just gonna read you a little bit of a quote from these heavenly books that

194
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,280
they restored my fate. Oh, shit. That old hand, she never leaves me alone. I hate her and her Jesus.

195
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,920
I wish she was dead, dead, dead. All right. Yeah, you could see more of that on the given,

196
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,800
given gaming stream of Minecraft featuring Munchie becoming a licensed guy ever. I'll end you,

197
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,360
but you came later. You came after the Jesus. I came to chill, Hillary. Okay, all right, let's get

198
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,880
back to God. Damn it. That's what I did. Watch those live streams sometime, monkey. You will

199
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,400
hear the most blue-pilled man in the world. Okay, go on. Go on, Tom, please. I don't even remember

200
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,920
what I was talking about. I was more just like, you talked about, I guess, any specific spooky

201
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,400
stories or paranormal event. Like you said that you had an event the other day, and I was curious

202
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
what the incident was. Yeah, okay. So what happened the other day, and it was easy for me to just

203
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,120
kind of like, yeah, this is just me being dumb, but still, at the same time, your primitive brain

204
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,240
definitely fucks with you, is that at my job, for people who don't know, I work as a quote-unquote

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,960
security guard overnight at this abandoned mill. It's like a couple hundred years old. It's been

206
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,720
hollowed out for like a hundred years. There's nothing in there. Do you live in a Scooby-Doo episode?

207
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,880
You know, if I lived in a Scooby-Doo episode, eventually I get to the point where I take the

208
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,720
mask off and realize my evil boss is behind everything, but I haven't gone to that point yet.

209
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,640
I perpetually trapped in the middle of a Scooby-Doo episode, which I'd argue is worse.

210
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,800
So, in between, like every two hours, I got to go do a round. So I go around the entire building

211
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,440
and like make sure nobody's breaking in, because the worst thing that happens in this building is

212
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,080
like, you know, skateboarders come in and try and break windows or whatever. But it's overnight,

213
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,560
so nobody comes in. So I just basically sit there, breathe asbestos, and long for death. So

214
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,680
I wish I was joking. So in between like the two rounds between like 11 and 1,

215
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,400
half of the lights on the second floor just all went out at the same time. So when I go up there

216
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,000
and like I'm trying to like go through the building and I get to the part, like usually when I go

217
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,120
through at this point and do my round, I just I'm not even paying attention just on my phone

218
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,240
doing whatever and just like walking through the motions. But like I get to the point where the

219
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,160
lights are off and like instantly the entire energy of the building like shifted. And I knew

220
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,200
it was just like my brain fucking up. But it felt like there was like some presence in there.

221
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,480
There was like a super loud bang next to me and I looked over and nothing's there. And I'm just

222
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,520
like, Oh, it's fucked up. So it was it was really fucking weird. And then like, there's the worst

223
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,080
room in the building, the whole building leaks, and it's perpetually just like wet and soaked and

224
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,280
there's like moss and shit growing in there. So there's just one room that's like it leaks so

225
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,520
bad, it's always flooded. And like, my body like refused to go in there, just because I was getting

226
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,880
like super bad vibes. And I'm usually not somebody who listens to vibes. And I'm just like, you know

227
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,440
what, even if there is like no ghost in there, whatever, it's pitch black, and there's holes

228
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,640
off throughout the floor. So I don't want to fall like two floors down. So I'm just not gonna fucking

229
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,480
go in there. So I didn't go in there. And it was fine. And and but yeah, it was like it was it felt

230
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,560
like just it was like my brain playing tricks. I mean, it literally felt like there was something

231
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,080
like evil in there just because like my brain was going haywire. And I told my dad about and he's

232
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,920
like, Yeah, I've definitely had experiences. There's definitely like, there's definitely like

233
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,200
spirits in there fucking the shit up because like over 100 people have died in that building,

234
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,760
apparently. So crazy. Tom, that is the source of global warming. You found the one room where

235
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,800
global warming is being impetuated. You have to go there. It is it is like a perpetual warming

236
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,960
ghost machine. It is a perpetual greenhouse in there with like the way it's always like hot and

237
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,640
gross and sticky. So maybe it is maybe that is the the the bed of global warming right there.

238
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,600
And we need to know I feel like it'd be relevant to read another definition relevant to that story

239
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,840
that I didn't read at the beginning. So let me just read you the definition for ghost anal real

240
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,800
quick. Okay, God ghost anal happens when you are fucked in the ass by a huge dick and it leaves

241
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,720
you feeling like you still have a huge dick in your ass, even though the guy left about an hour

242
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,840
ago. And let me read just the little example here. It still feels like I'm being fucked in the ass.

243
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,440
Woman B, do you have a good case of ghost anal woman a no I have a job beating in 30 and it

244
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,920
feels like my shit is going to fall out. There you go. That's we've all been there.

245
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,760
My life is another quote from Titanic. Oh, you can't do this to me. It's not fair.

246
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,200
Just what I had it made. I hate you for this. God.

247
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,640
Inside of you, it's a flash of the things you've changed, while the cues are real rain.

248
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,240
And bright green eyes. Okay, now glowing green eyes. Oh, fuck. Okay. You're not a real fan.

249
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,400
You don't get to join Ember's Ghost Squad with me. Oh, yeah, you'll be in there for sure.

250
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,240
Okay, let's go to our next champion. Unless you have more, Tom, do you have any more stories?

251
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,920
No, ghosts are gay. But they're cool. I don't know. I'm conflicted.

252
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh, fair enough. Give give what's the spookiest ghost story you are?

253
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,560
Well, the thing about ghosts and stuff is that I'm skeptical and I know that there's,

254
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,360
there's, you know, logical explanations for things. So when I'm in and like out in the dark,

255
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,600
in a spooky area, and I and I hear something and it's for it spooks me and I'm like,

256
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,040
but I get all excited. I'm like, okay, let's think what, what could that have actually been?

257
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,640
And I go through in my head like, oh, yeah, science and reason and logic and, you know,

258
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,240
facts and shit. And I'm professor ladies like equations flying around your head.

259
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,600
And I deduce like what it probably could have been like, oh, there's probably an owl like falling

260
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,360
over, you know. A very loud thing and owl falling over.

261
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:37,240
Well, you know, it's like something, something strange that you can easily like wave away.

262
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Maybe the owl got scared by a ghost and fell. Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. So, so I'm very

263
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,880
into like ghostly places, but I know it's not ghosts. I just like being a little frightened.

264
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,040
There was this one time when I was on a goonery, which is like a week camp out in a country place.

265
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,680
I go there and I, and you know, sometimes at night, well, I'll just say it's, it's a scout

266
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,760
group for like disabled kids and I help out and I'm a volunteer. But after lights go out,

267
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,720
after you put all the kids to bed, you can just walk around and it's usually on a school premises,

268
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,440
you know, we hire out of school ground and stuff. And there was this one time it was dark,

269
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,120
and I went into the school building and you're not really supposed to,

270
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,880
but the doors open. So I'm like, shit, let's go. And I brought my brother, we went in there with

271
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,320
a torch and there was, you know, it was the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was so funny

272
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,800
because the next day I came in and I realized what it was. There was this giant, I guess it was

273
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,800
like a school mascot. It's a giant ceramic gorilla wearing a school uniform. And I just went on

274
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,560
there. The floors, the floors were creaky. They were like renovating parts of the building. So

275
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,720
there was like, like those buildings where like the floor was all ripped up and there was nothing

276
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,480
in it. And then there was just this in the foyer. There's a big old fucking gorilla.

277
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,640
Fucking spooky because I thought there was something there. And I love, I love thinking,

278
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,960
what the fuck could that be? I really got to go in there like when it's light. And yeah,

279
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,800
so I like spooky, spooky places. I like being spooked. And I like thinking about it, but I don't

280
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,400
really say I don't really mind like people being like believing in it. I just think they're

281
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:20,120
a bit stupid. Yeah, yeah. Here in America, the only time we get spooked by gorillas is when we

282
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:27,160
go visit Compton. Oh, no, guys, I don't know if anybody saw us on Twitter. I just the last week,

283
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,880
I went to the zoo. They had just the day before I went, they had reopened the gorilla exhibit where

284
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,960
that shit went down with Harambe, literally the place where it happened. I stood there. Oh my

285
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,800
God, you see the ghost of Harambe running around in the water. He was, he was like, I know who did

286
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:50,120
9 11. It was like, I know who did 9 11. It was and then he fades away and you're like, who, who

287
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,520
wasn't Harambe? No, I'll never know. Yeah, technically that gorilla got more votes in the

288
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,320
last election than Bernie Sanders did. Oh, it's so sad, but it's true. Is that really true? Is that

289
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,640
actually true? I mean, do you think Democrats wasted their vote in the election on Bernie?

290
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,960
He wasn't allowed. They killed it. You can write in any name you want. You can write in any name

291
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,800
you want in the election. It doesn't count, I don't think, if they're not registered, but you can still do that.

292
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:24,280
Well, yeah, I guess you wouldn't think to burn. Okay, well, in any case, there's only one thing

293
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,320
scary than a ghost and that's a black person, fat. Yeah, you can't even see them in the dark. What is

294
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,960
that? What's going on there? Oh my God, imagine if there are black ghosts, dude, like twice as

295
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
I'm gonna steal my ectoplasm. I've seen what you called ghost addicts. Ghost dad, ghost dad,

296
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,840
ghost dad, my favorite racist. He's gonna rape you. No, he's gonna quailude the shit out of everybody.

297
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,680
Okay, um, he's gonna have a hung jury. I want to talk about my experience with ghosts because,

298
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,600
unfortunately, they have alluded to me all my life except for when I was a baby. And as we all

299
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,560
know, babies and ghosts don't mix because ghosts are just too sexually aggressive and babies just

300
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,080
don't know how to contain their raw sexual ability. And they just lead the ghosts on to the point of

301
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,120
absurdity. So when I was a little kid, I was just, you know, I was just running around. And then I was

302
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,600
just, you know, just fucking around cartwheeling all over the place, which, you know, you do kicking

303
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:28,840
the shit out of plants. And then, yeah, and then I just started screaming at the top of my of my

304
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,280
fucking lungs, which, you know, I'm known to do, right? I started screaming bad man and pointing

305
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:41,240
at like nothing. And so my my fucking mom came out and she was like, Hey, how's how's it going? Why

306
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,960
you screaming? Shut the fuck up. Get my bell. And then and she was like, Oh, man, I felt weird that

307
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,400
day. I could almost see God himself staring down me and telling me to leave because I knew there

308
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,960
was a bad man there. And then and then later, after I was told the story, I was like, You're

309
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,000
fucking stupid. Kill yourself. You should make you should make a hit movie called The Bad Bad Man.

310
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,720
And that's about yeah, that's good. And ever since then, I've liked ghosts. And so I tried to go

311
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,400
like I live in San Diego, and there's like a really historical famous ghost site place holy

312
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,000
site called the Whaley house. And this was it's supposed to be mad mad spiritual bro. You're mad

313
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,880
consciousness up. If you know what I mean, lol. So I went there. And I was just like, Hey, if you're

314
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,640
a ghost, I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't get out here right fucking now, bro. I'm gonna

315
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:39,560
post all your nudes on Snapchat if you don't get right now, bro. You know, bro. So no ghost came

316
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,400
not even not even like a ghost dog was there is a ghost dog there. There's a guy who like stole a

317
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,240
boat. He attempted to steal a boat, but he didn't like successfully steal the boat. And he was

318
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,200
captured and hung for almost stealing a boat. And now he just walks around fucking with people.

319
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,160
And I want I wanted to see him. I wanted to see fucking the dog almost the little little children.

320
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,760
So I so I could whisk them away with, you know, it would be really, really, you know, great aesthetically

321
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,960
to those children capture a ghost like an infinite slime source available at any time that would be

322
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,040
really convenient for you. I mean, that's a side project. That's a pet project I'm working on right

323
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,560
now, where I just have a bunch of souls, not only producing more and more heat to, you know,

324
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,360
admit the atmosphere, but producing slime for me to drink daily. Learn the mad truths.

325
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,760
As I say before, I'm reverse blind. And the way I can, I can, you know, keep up my all seeing

326
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,000
eye and all my, you know, hide and senses if I drink a ton of slime, which, you know, I need

327
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,400
ghosts for. So I go around all the time hunting ghosts, not too successful lately. I think the

328
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,160
ghosts of, you know, they've been on the down though. I wonder what's stopping them. It's probably

329
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,040
the global warming. That's, you know, you know, like, like global warming is caused by ghosts,

330
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,560
but also harmful to ghosts. It's like, it's a lot like poetry, you know? It rhymes.

331
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,640
Munchy, do you know what the two scariest ghosts of all time are? The ghosts of those two kids

332
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,880
that Gal Gadot fucking killed. Oh, no. Where did she do that? Where did she do that?

333
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,880
You'll have to tell me you're the expert in this field. My favorite ghost is both the ghosts of

334
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,920
the Twin Towers. Those guys. They still haunt that place. If you go there and you're like,

335
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,120
you know, you're like hovering on a jetpack. In the Freedom Tower? Yeah. Yeah. If you're hovering

336
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,560
near where they were, like 70% up at the top, you can feel the concrete. You can feel it.

337
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,720
I know every single time, you know, if I'm ever low on ghost power and I always, you know, if I

338
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,720
just want to get shooed, if I just want to take the easy way out, I'll just prance along the trail

339
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,200
of tears and I'll just get my butterfly net out and I'll just fucking swing it all up in the air.

340
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,280
And I'll get that mad slime, bro. I'll get that mad slime. It'll be really funny.

341
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,400
I want to say, like, I'm thinking of like the way people talk about like spirituality and being

342
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,920
connected to the dead and how you're so dumb. They're not real. They're not real. Dead people

343
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,640
are never, they didn't exist. They just, they didn't exist ever. And, you know, they're talking

344
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,240
about that. And I'm like, I completely get it. I just use different language. Like if somebody

345
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,040
says, Oh, there's a guy who died there. I don't feel nothing. I do feel like, Oh, there's a guy

346
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,080
died here. There's a guy died right at my feet. Like, like, like 10 hundred years ago. And I'm

347
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,320
like, Oh, and really what it is, is that I'm feeling, I'm feeling like empathy for a human being

348
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,800
or sympathy or whatever it is. And that's the feeling I get. And they're talking about that

349
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,080
feeling being something else coming at them. Like they can't produce some external spiritual energy

350
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,720
and not like an internal kind of psychological reaction. Yeah. That's funny. It's funny that

351
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,280
when you find out somebody died, you feel like empathy or sympathy because I just feel envy.

352
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,440
Of course. Of course. Lucky motherfucker. Gotta do what I've always wanted. Before, before

353
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,680
monkey goes into his ghost story, I just want to bring up real quick. What do you guys think about

354
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:08,600
about spirit mediums of people who talk to the dead? Because I'm the greatest con artist retarded

355
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,440
or both, you know, to their credit, I think some of them might just be delusional. They think they

356
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,640
have powers. They're they're they're con artists. There we go. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good

357
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:29,160
one pending. You know that you know that Long Island spirit medium lady. I hate her so much.

358
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,560
She's like, everyone just fucking eats her shit. They're like, oh, yeah, you're talking to my dead

359
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,680
grandma. Oh, I feel so good. I feel so like cathartic that I got to talk to her. She's dead

360
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,840
and she's dying in hell. Thank you for letting me know. Stop. Everybody stop. It's not it's not

361
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,080
real replaced with a sans who just says she she's burning in hell. Don't worry about it.

362
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,360
Sands will be straight with you on that. Okay, so okay, mediums are shit. They're all garbage.

363
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,120
Okay, all mediums and psychics are just con artists. It's true. Yeah. Yeah, I yeah, they are

364
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,560
con artists. They're con artists and stupid, but they're aesthetically really pleasing and and

365
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,080
like spooky and like I always want to get my I want to go and get my magic ball read and so I

366
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,440
it can just be like some things will happen in your future. I can feel it. It's shit.

367
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:25,000
You know, not just just things will occur. I guarantee it. Have any of you guys gone into one

368
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,520
of those because like your parents were there and just like hey, let's do it. This would be fun or

369
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,200
like a friend or something and you go in there like and you're like you are the the stereotypical

370
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,680
I don't believe in this ghost stuff the whole time. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't think I've

371
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,680
actually done that, but I've certainly felt it. I certainly thought it while I was there. I hope

372
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,840
they picked up my I feel like I feel that in church and ironically do you stop to go to church

373
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,120
I used to until until I until I broke my conditioning. Yeah, I didn't let the Zionist

374
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,840
control my brain anymore. I went till I was like 16 or something. I got confirmed. So

375
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,000
isn't it crazy that people like like when you're a child, they try to like get you wedded to the

376
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,880
idea so that you can't leave. You know, it's like it's the whole thing with like a thing with

377
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,040
if you're a Muslim and you try to leave like, you know, it's not good. They downvoted on Reddit.

378
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:22,520
Yeah, they'll shave your beard. Yeah, really close. A very close shave like

379
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:30,200
Sweeney Todd. Yeah, okay, that's I love you ghost. Monkey, tell me your spook stories.

380
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,960
Well, first I wanted to say about these mediums and these psychics back when I was doing a video

381
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,680
over a documentary called My Monkey Baby, there's a scene where a psychic she's like an animal psychic

382
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,840
who can talk to the woman's monkey and tell her if the monkey ate her pills and all this

383
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,680
I remember watching this. Yeah, so I wanted to prank call one and all the places I called,

384
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,320
of course, like didn't answer, like they didn't put up with my bullshit. But I looked at the prices

385
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,000
and they charged these motherfuckers, these con artists were charging $25 for every 15 minutes

386
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,840
of advice. I thought you're gonna say hour and I was gonna be like, that's not that bad, but okay,

387
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:15,160
yeah, fuck that $100 an hour to talk to these con artists. If you're if you're gonna manipulating

388
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,320
people, that's the career field to jump into hell. I want to go do that shit. It's just such a

389
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,480
parasitic thing to take advantage of people's like gullibility. It's not I think it's just

390
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,680
natural selection at work, though. But the problem is like because of our goddamn welfare state,

391
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,240
the dumb people keep living and breeding and we're going to get overrun with shitty people who

392
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:42,680
believe in Jesus. Nate, isn't it your responsibility then to believe them out of their money so

393
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,600
they have no choice but to die in the streets after they floundered even their state given money?

394
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Aren't you doing God's work? But they'll get on fucking welfare and they'll drain it from the top,

395
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,840
they'll drain it from the earners. Okay, I'm getting on a weird political rant. Let's not

396
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,280
get into that shit right now. What are you saying, Gib? What's up? I was saying, I feel like it takes

397
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,840
a certain special type of person who does kind of believe in it to calm these people because

398
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,800
I can't imagine somebody who does know that it's bullshit actually making any money doing it.

399
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,720
Not due to guilt. No, no, no, no. I feel like you have to kind of believe it too much because the

400
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,120
way it is is that these people, they keep it up like so much that it's hard to imagine that they

401
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:34,680
don't believe it. They indoctrinate themselves. It makes sense to kind of condition yourself to

402
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,200
unbreak the conditioning. You have to be a really good actor and if you're doing that.

403
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,720
But they know that there's not a ghost telling them things in their ear. They're just making

404
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,240
shit up. So how can they have that cognitive dissonance? They're making shit up but they believe

405
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,720
that the thoughts that they're making in their heads are things that are being planted by spirits.

406
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,200
I think there are definitely people who do that. Humans are really good at tricking themselves.

407
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,440
I was going to say, no, I think there's both. I think there's definitely people who think

408
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,800
that the random thoughts that come to them during those whatever encounters are actually

409
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,840
the dead. But I think there are other people who are acutely aware of like, I'm fucking this person

410
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,760
over for $25 every 15 minutes. I feel like the ratio is more in favor of people who believe that

411
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:25,320
it's working. Because to be successful in doing that, you have to be a really good actor.

412
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,280
And I don't know how many good actors there are doing that.

413
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,160
I'm inclined to believe, Gib. I agree. I think people are really good at doing that. But even

414
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,680
if they don't actually believe, there's also like, they could think that like, because I've heard

415
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,000
some people say that they are like entertainers. And so like, they're here to like-

416
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,680
That's the legal defense they have to do.

417
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,000
I fucking hate that so much. That fucking cowardly, just admit. Just say you're a goddamn actor and

418
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,320
it's all a lie. Don't be like, oh, I'm an entertainer. Like, it's up to people to believe what they want.

419
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,400
Like that dude who wears that weird giant like blonde wig, poofy hair thing, you know that guy

420
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,480
who was in that H3HC video. Oh, those fucking cowards, bunch of fucking cowards.

421
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,840
Yeah. There's a Dateline NBC special about this where they went undercover and like,

422
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,360
they paid this psychically thousands of dollars for crystals and magic rocks and all this bullshit.

423
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,480
I can't get it on that, bro. Yeah, you should. It's the perfect job for Munch.

424
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,080
And of course, like for, I mean, I'm just going on a thing, but like there's the James

425
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,360
Randy Foundation that for like decades was offering like a one million dollar prize.

426
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,880
If you can just prove any of this shit's real in any way and nobody ever fucking did,

427
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,160
nobody took the million dollars because they fucking lying. They're all fucking liars.

428
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,360
Of course. What can you do?

429
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,040
All right. Here's my dad's ghost story. Word.

430
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,480
So it's a tragic story because when my brother, or I guess when my dad was 15,

431
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,440
his brother was fucking shot to death on the street by some, yeah, it's pretty sad.

432
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,040
This gang banger piece of shit. And no, I'm not just telling the story of that movie again.

433
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,720
Oh, that's the first thing I thought you were going to do. I'm not telling Moonlight again.

434
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,200
This is real life events. Okay. All right. If you say so.

435
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,360
So it's a year later, my dad's 16 on the one year anniversary of his brother being shot to death.

436
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,400
He is driving to school with his friend and they look, there's a big semi truck like behind them.

437
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,120
They see in the rearview mirror and they swear to God to this day, my father still believes this,

438
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,480
that the guy driving the truck was his dead brother. So what do they do? They're driving to

439
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,840
school. They turn that fucking car around and they spend the next hour and a half following

440
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,000
that truck trying to catch up to it when they finally do they look in the window. No, it's just

441
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,160
some old guy. It's just some old man. Some of my dad now thinks that it was a ghost. His brother's

442
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,280
ghost was driving a semi truck and I'm like, okay, dad, I'm not gonna make fun of you to your face,

443
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,160
but that's retarded. That's a bit silly, but yeah, you know, that seems like the kind of stuff

444
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,760
people believe. Yeah, it's kind of cute. I mean, both him and his friend swear they saw the brother's

445
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,920
face and it was the one year anniversary. So can you even blame my dad for believing this shit?

446
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:06,840
It's like too much of a coincidence that they both saw it. My dad has a story where he, you know,

447
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,960
he backs it up by saying, yeah, it was him and his sister, they both saw the same thing and it was

448
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:20,840
like a spooky man or something. And but at the same time, he tells that story and then at the

449
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,840
end he says, but it was probably just, you know, a car passing by and the light shining through

450
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,720
the window somewhere and going down the hallway. So he knows that it's probably not real and it's

451
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,560
just something, but he still likes the freakiness of it. How two people saw exactly the same thing

452
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,200
and thought it was this exact same thing. And then they were like, ah, so yeah. Yeah, I mean,

453
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,120
that does make it weird. It makes it seem very convincing if two people come to the same conclusion

454
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,040
about something. There are, though, I mean, just, you know, again, to beat my own dick about this

455
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,760
stuff because I've done a lot of reading about it. Like there are tons of things that have happened

456
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,680
historically. Like there are phenomenon where I think in like there was a South American village

457
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,520
one time where like the entire village witnessed like something happened, like the sun, like they

458
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,760
saw the face of God like over the surface of the sun, like everyone in the village did this the

459
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,920
exact same time. But like there are there are many ways to explain it besides like God exists and

460
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,160
decided to look at this village from the sun one time. It could have been like a sunspot or

461
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,240
like some sort of visual phenomenon. It also could be like the power of, you know, if everybody says

462
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,960
they saw something and then you feel like, well, I saw it too. Yeah, they just want to be part of the

463
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,520
group. Yeah, see, there's just so many problems. You have to like isolate. If you want me to

464
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,160
believe any of this shit people, you got to make a fucking proof and there has never been any ever.

465
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,520
So good luck with that. But yeah, okay, cool.

466
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,160
One time I was possessed by the devil. How'd that go?

467
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,160
Besides like continuous one that continues to this day. Right now I'm just being possessed by a

468
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:08,920
lowly ghost, but I was once at Bealzebub's court himself. I was over to like like test out my

469
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,080
cousin's new house that they bought a while ago. It's like, you know, you know, bash some shit in,

470
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:20,520
you know, break some windows and get it home broken as in breaking the home. And I became

471
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,520
like incredibly ill for no reason. And they live in the high desert. So everything's like super dry

472
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:31,720
and in like hot all the time. So I got I got I got a mad fever, a delirious fever. And I

473
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,680
could barely see it was all like fuzzy, like even fuzzier than if you like took off your

474
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,320
glasses and then like poured Clorox in your face, which I do every single day to practice my religion.

475
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,280
But it was it was awful. I could barely hear anything. And I slipped in and out consciousness

476
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,720
a ton. And you just thought, well, you know, this is probably the devil. Like that, like, you know,

477
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,880
I have a fever. The devil probably gave me a fever. That's probably what is occurring right now.

478
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,840
So I might as well be possessed. I might as well go out and just allow myself to be possessed.

479
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,800
So I was just like, All right, prove to me, God, if you're real, make the devil be real, too,

480
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:18,920
please. And so I like to think about like the next like out like like day, like a day was just

481
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,800
about how like, okay, the devil is in my head now. And he wants me to fucking kill all my friends

482
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,960
and family. That's what he wants. And I couldn't move or anything. So all I could do is just like

483
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,400
watch Isle of Lucy and like think about how the devil is commanding me to like just like fucking

484
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,960
get a knife and kill everyone near me and what and then watch more Isle of Lucy and Fresh Prince

485
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,880
of Balair and like transformers. And it was the greatest experience of my life. And after my

486
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,600
fear went away and the devil's subsided, the devil now like lives inside my body, but he doesn't

487
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:56,600
have full control. Every once in a while, he'll come back into my headspace. He'll become he's

488
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:02,760
one of my most prominent headmates and every every every smile to his little friend. And it's

489
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,800
pretty great. And I would recommend to everyone, please let the devil into your heart. This is all

490
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,400
I have to say on the matter. All right, well, sick dog. Let me Okay, here, let me tell you my the

491
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,520
only story I have. It's not me against my dad. And it's about the Holy Ghost. It's not about

492
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah. So like, have you killed your dad yet? My Well, I mean, he didn't even put in those terms.

493
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,840
He like my dad is a religious guy, which I continue to find baffling because he's so

494
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:34,360
wanted. Don't I don't I don't understand how anyone intelligent believes. Okay, but but like

495
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,880
one day while I was grill them, I'm like, dad, you got to tell me like, I don't understand why you

496
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,200
believe in any of this shit. You got to tell me because I'm see I'm drawing a blank here, dad.

497
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,120
What's the deal? It's like, okay, Nate, I've had some experiences in my life that made me think

498
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,000
there's some spooky shit going on. And here's here's here's here's the one that that he chose.

499
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,440
This was his best example. Okay, so it was he's he's with like, I believe my mom and

500
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,760
her sisters like my aunt don't don't remember which one. And they were hanging out and they

501
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,520
were like in a city somewhere. I don't know which one. And like, oh, so they're just they're back

502
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,000
to cross the road, right? They're just standing there, ready to cross this fucking road. And like,

503
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,160
like, so my my mom and her sister like start to walk across because they don't see a fucking car

504
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,600
coming. And then like, according to my dad, he felt something he felt a presence, warning him

505
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,480
specifically warning him that like something bad's about to happen. Stop them, you know,

506
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,760
pull them back. And he listened to it. And he grabbed them and he pulled them back. And then

507
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,560
like a car came by like, oh, shit, they would have died or something. That's been a bit of an

508
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,200
intuition. That's I mean, that was of course, I didn't challenge him because I could tell he

509
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,360
was you know, he's deep into the shit, unfortunately. And there's no way I could convince him just by

510
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,400
arguing. But like, yeah, I mean, they obviously there are plenty of other things that could have

511
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,280
been going on in the man's brain. I just feel like like something like that you said you could have

512
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,200
thought to yourself. Yeah, I'm so cool. And I have spidey senses. That's why I saved their life.

513
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,160
No, it was some other guy. It was just some gods. He did it. I'm not actually cool. Why do you have

514
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,160
to do that? Why can't you be spider man? I don't think they're not spider man. I think the only

515
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,600
reason the emphasis I got from it was like that it was like a voice that he heard. Like that seemed

516
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,840
to be like the impression I got from how he told the story. And that's why he like attributed it to

517
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,400
like God. And I asked him, so like, why into Christianity? Like what's, and he's like, well,

518
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,080
I'm not really, I mean, who the fuck knows if that shit's real. But like, I did feel like it was

519
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,640
like a godly presence or something. So, so that's good. Because like, why would you ever believe

520
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,960
that like one specific religion is true if you don't have any actual evidence for it guys? So,

521
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,200
you just remember guys, you happen to be in the religion that your parents are, because it's a

522
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,680
fucking cultural thing. You just raised that way. It's not fucking real. Break the conditioning.

523
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,680
Okay. Break the conditioning. The whole like hearing voices in the head thing. I think a lot

524
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,520
of people who say they hear voices hear a voice, which is them with that, which is that in a monologue.

525
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:06,360
And the only reason they say the words out loud in their head is because they've read that people

526
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,200
hear voices and that's what they think God is. So they, when they, when they have an intuition

527
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,840
and they think, I should probably change this, they think to themselves, you should stop doing

528
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,080
that. I'm God. And they're like, Oh my God, God's speaking to me, but it's just them. But they just

529
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,960
put the voice in their head because they think that's what a voice, you know, that's what's

530
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,960
supposed to happen. I'm telling you, man, it's that it's that human, like we humans have an

531
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:35,480
incredible capacity for pattern recognition and like anthropomorphization. I love thinking about

532
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,400
it. I love thinking about why people do it. I love thinking about ghosts. I love thinking about

533
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,880
spooky shit. I love it all. It's so cool. I don't even hate it. I don't even think it's stupid.

534
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,480
It's great. Can the thumbnail for this, can the thumbnail for this episode be Danny Phantom

535
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,240
tipping his fedora? If such an image exists. No, hippos are going to draw it for us.

536
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,600
Yeah, I will draw it by copy pasting a fedora onto an image of Danny Phantom.

537
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,840
That sounds perfect. That sounds perfect. If we're talking about our parents now,

538
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:13,400
my mother is a goldmine of gullible actions and insanities. You convinced her to let you go to

539
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,120
fucking Brony Connellone when you were like 12. Absolutely delusional. You know, completely out

540
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:28,840
of her mind. I'm sure she's just putty in your hands. Oh, you know it, bro. I have those mad

541
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:35,480
manipulation skills, bro. I'm mad. Absolutely mad. I can imagine now. Mom, where are my tendies,

542
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:43,720
mom? Where's my slime? Where's my ecto coolers? Okay, go on. Go on. Where's my fucking juice?

543
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:55,320
My soup, my correspondence. Where's my crystals? I need them to do a baptism over the internet, mom.

544
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,600
I'm going to a J.O. sesh right now, mom. I need my crystals. Okay. Okay. Anyway, tell us the tale.

545
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,800
So we never, she's never been that religious. She grew up religious, but it's not that she

546
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,600
doesn't, you know, she isn't the religious herself. She's just too lazy to convince me to be one.

547
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,640
That's good. That's preferred. So we go to church a little bit, but you know, not too often,

548
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,720
mostly just for each certain, you know, big events. But anyway, she had a sort of like,

549
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,280
like second wave, you know, like second wind, like, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to be religious

550
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,640
again. It's going to be really, really going to be it like a couple of years ago. And instead of

551
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:38,120
just like getting back into like a church, she started researching online for like, what is Jesus

552
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,840
really? What is like real Jesus? Okay. All right. All right. She's breaking the conditioning a

553
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,360
little bit. Yeah. Oh, dude, the conditioning is fucking shattered by the point, by the end of the

554
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,680
story. That's not existent anyway. So she, so she finds out like all the, the, the mysticism,

555
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,400
the, the, the modern mysticism, you know, like you're, I'm talking, you know, you got your

556
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,320
cosmic beings of light powers. You got your, you know, church of euthanasia. You got your fucking,

557
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,560
you know, uh, what's that guy's name? Something, something Apple white. You got those kind of

558
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,040
people. You got that one, uh, uh, Colton, Colton Tokyo that tried to, you know, raise the sarin

559
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:21,160
gas on the bus. That kind of shit. You know, uh, like, like crystals and all that kind of stuff,

560
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,840
which is where like, I was, you know, I had known about that culture, but from my mom,

561
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,600
you know, starting to practice, I really got like a taste for it. And I realized it was my

562
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,880
favorite thing in the entire world. Oh, okay. Okay. And I, you know, I, I love crystals and I

563
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,480
love chakras. They're my favorite. Let me find spirit science. My greatest discovery of all time.

564
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:47,320
Yep. And the rest is history, but from her, uh, she created a sort of like monument to Jesus,

565
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:54,520
but not like, when you like, not like Jesus, Jesus, more like, like slime, like ghost Jesus,

566
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,520
like, like the soup, like super Jesus, basically. Right. And it was, it was basically just like a

567
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:06,760
bunch of J pegs of Jesus, like super cross posterized. So it's just like fucking undecipherable.

568
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,960
And a ton, like, like it was just like neon green, uh, cardboard, like slab, I guess,

569
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:21,400
with a ton of J pegs of Jesus, you know, pasted on. And just some like, um, if you believe hard

570
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,720
enough, Jesus is real. And, uh, and, and, and like fucking like in like Microsoft word, like,

571
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,240
like word art, like change it to like make it look cool. Your mother is a master of aesthetics,

572
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,200
dude. This sounds amazing. Okay. Okay. It's incredible. And just a, just a ton of crosses,

573
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,640
but like most of them are broken and they had, and she had to glue them back together.

574
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,320
And, uh, it's just, it's a bunch of like literal just rocks, but like somewhat,

575
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,760
somewhat sparkly if you put them in the right light. Uh, and yeah, just a ton of shit like that.

576
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,280
And she hung it like over her wall. Uh, and the way the house is positioned, she hung it like,

577
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,400
her door would always be open and like you could like see, trust me when you say, uh,

578
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,800
every time I go to the kitchen, I had to look at that fucking poster of Jesus. Okay. Uh, you know,

579
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:14,120
Jesus, just, just believe hard enough and Jesus is real. Jesus is magic. You are magic. And if,

580
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,760
and if you just fucking align your chakras and go vegan, then you'll be able to see the spirits.

581
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,600
You'll, you'll be able to see in 4D, bro. You'll be able to get all four dimensions. Yes. Yes.

582
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,520
And she was super into it. And she, and she kept, when, uh, when we visited Denver a while ago

583
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,360
to visit family, she was like, you know, this is pretty good, you know, being with family,

584
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,720
but, but I buy the seminar I need to go to and, you know, you just hang out, just hang out around

585
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Denver while I go to this, this cool ass seminar where they, the Dalai Lama, you know, jacks off

586
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:51,160
all over me and I'm able to find, I'll be able to speak, I'll be able to speak to Nazis in their

587
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,360
sleep. I'll be able, I'll be able to find out where Hitler stashed his fucking ghoul and where,

588
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,080
and where, and where Hitler's like personal fitness trainer, like, like, like, got all the

589
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,560
crosses in the nation together and made like one supercross. And I'll be able, I'll be able to

590
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,760
know everything, bro. I'll be able to, I'll be able to personally fund global warming myself.

591
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,560
I'll be that ghost powerful. And, uh, she did it. And this continued for a while until I was just

592
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,920
like, uh, you know, you should probably, you know, that's not really a good idea. I don't think.

593
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,040
So she went to like a bunch of seminars or was just one? Yeah. Okay. No, a bunch. Like, yeah. Well,

594
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,600
by a bunch, I mean, like, one time my mom went to a Harry Potter seminar in Canada. That was pretty

595
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,280
cool. Yeah, by yourself, by yourself. I mean, I mean, I mean, that's going to give her mad

596
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,520
spirituality. No doubt, dog. Which isn't shit, bro. Yeah. Shit's crazy. But, uh, yeah, eventually

597
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,160
she kind of tapered off because, uh, she, she, she read something like one of like the leaders

598
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,240
she was like listening to about spirituality had like raped like 70 children. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

599
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,480
He's got to absorb that ectoplasm from him. He's got to do it, dude. Ghost should leave

600
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,560
it inside children's testicles. He just needs to get inside, bro. And, uh, okay. And, and she was

601
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:10,040
like, uh, well, you know, I guess it's still, it's still like real, but I, you know, I might get

602
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:19,880
focused on other stuff. Yeah. Anyway, great. Thank you, mother, for allowing me to understand

603
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,320
spirit science, the only thing that matters in the world, and align my chakras to such

604
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,840
decent that I have. But dude, if you think my Christ consciousness is like high, her talk was

605
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,240
or so fucking bliss that it was hard to even look at her. She was just like a glowing, a glowing

606
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:40,360
white fucking like spectacle to observe. Fuck, yes. To the level like eight, bro, like level eight.

607
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,280
Holy shit. All right. Well, you got to get her on one day to really weigh in on this shit. Yeah.

608
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,680
When, when we start our long awaited, uh, spirit science analysis series, uh, you know, we'll

609
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:55,800
get the expert in. Well, that's, that's dope. Um, yeah, it's great. Well, shit team. Uh, well,

610
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,640
can we come to any conclusions here? What, what have we learned here today? The parts of the

611
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,680
Caribbean, the first movie with a heart ghost is really good because they also skeletons, but

612
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,840
I was about to say, they're skeletons and ghosts. They're not even ghosts. They're not even dead

613
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:14,920
for real. They're all dead. They're just they're cursed. They're not even full skeletons. They're

614
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:21,400
barely even. We're all full skeletons on the inside. That's true. They're fake fans, if you will.

615
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,760
They're fake fans of being a ghost, not of like fans of the idea of being a ghost, but they are

616
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,800
fake fans of like being a ghost that they are a ghost. Right. Okay. Yeah. All right, boys. My

617
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:41,720
belief ghost of all time. Oh, Moaning Myrtle. Wait, did you say worst? Worst. Yeah. Moaning

618
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:47,400
Myrtle. Worst ghost of all time. She's pretty bad. I mean, I was never, I was never too oppressed by

619
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,440
Casper's. All right. You know, he was plucky. He was adventurous. Yeah. Friendly punk ass bitch.

620
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,000
He didn't tell me where all, he didn't tell me where all the gold was.

621
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,240
He wasn't a 40 year old woman pretending to be jailbait floating around a girl's locker room,

622
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,880
for sure. Well, that's why I like Moaning Myrtle. You know, I know, I gotta say, I've never been a

623
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,280
fan of nearly headless Nick. Like, okay, he's a nice guy, but like, I'm never going to get over

624
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,000
the fact that he got cucked out of the whole headless thing. He's just he'll never, he'll never

625
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,440
be a full headless boy. He will never achieve that. But yeah, I'll always make him the worst.

626
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,920
Because he sucks because he can't even do it right. He can't do anything right. Instead of

627
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,720
tipping his hat, he tips his whole fucking head. It's amazing. You could do that if you were headless

628
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,000
to him though. He's played by John Cleese, the famous John Cleese. Yeah, he was in Rat Race.

629
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,160
I love Rat Race. And nothing else. Rat Race is my favorite movie. Me too, dude. We should listen.

630
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,640
Give me your Rat Race episode. We absolutely have to. I love Rat Race. It was my favorite movie

631
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,920
growing up. Yeah, me too. Well, that's what we learned, guys. Rat Race is the greatest movie

632
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,520
ever made. It's the best movie. It's so good. I think my favorite ghost is myself in the future,

633
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,160
when I become a ghost, which will happen. Oh, wait, wait. I have the worst ghost. Arania

634
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:10,040
Circuit? What have you said? Oh, Arania Circuit? It might actually be Arania. Okay, whatever.

635
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:15,560
We know the one. Spider bitch number two, right? Yes. Yeah. I mean, she was hot. She was really

636
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,160
sexual and Jake should have fucked her. I don't know. There was something wrong with her. There's

637
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,280
something wrong. I don't know what it was. I mean, what was wrong about her was that she turned

638
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,120
into like this evil psycho for no reason. Yeah, but even before that, she was just sort of like,

639
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:34,760
I'm so smart. I'm so smart. All of the dancers are the worst character ever made. That's not true.

640
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,120
Every single one. Mina sucks. Wait, wait. Who's a good one? No, Mina's all right. No, Mina's the

641
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,040
literally the best character. You take that back, you piece of shit. She sucks. She sucks shit.

642
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,840
She is only number two to Roxy in terms of girls and homestuck. She's great. She's fantastic. I love

643
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,040
her. Dude, just because you're a race trader doesn't mean we're all race traders, Nate.

644
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,360
Look, just because Vriska couldn't hack it and got blown the fuck out by how badass Mina was,

645
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,840
and Vriska was like, no, why don't you love me? I'm just going to pretend I'm as cool as you,

646
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,600
Mina. God, that was so pathetic. Vriska trying to be cool like Mina all along. Fuck you, Vriska.

647
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,400
Do you remember when Andrew Hussey got literally cucked in Canon and he watched them have sex

648
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,920
and wasn't literally cucked? I do remember that in general. That was great. Upvote.

649
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,680
We should probably stop talking about stuff that Monkey and Tom have no idea what it is.

650
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,280
Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's go to our questions here. All right, it's time for questions.

651
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,480
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Before the questions, I got a bit. Go for it.

652
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:34,680
We did a very official Twitter poll who is the worst PCP member and we've got the full results.

653
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,400
How many votes? How many votes did we get? Man, I didn't even get to vote.

654
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,280
We got 850 votes total. Okay, pretty good. That's pretty good. Should I go in order from

655
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,120
most hated to least hated or least hated to most hate? I mean, let's go from least hated

656
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:53,400
and then go all the way up to our winner, the most hated member. Okay, so with 16 votes,

657
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:00,120
the least hated PCP member is Hippo. Hey, what do you know? Who are those 16 people?

658
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:07,160
I'll kill them. That's an easy amount of people to kill. 16, I can do that. Those are all my alt

659
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,240
accounts. I'll turn them into ghosts. Okay, keep going. Who's next? Next we have with 21 votes,

660
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,040
Mr. Best Guy Ever. Yeah, all right. Yeah, I'm actually shocked. I'm actually shocked by that

661
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,080
because I talk so much. You just think that's a lot of material for people to hate me with,

662
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:27,240
but hey, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Then we have Mage at 55 votes. I guess they don't like

663
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,640
women because there's nothing to hate about Mage. Those are the 55 misogynists in our audience.

664
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,440
Yeah, okay. Oh, there's a small number. I know, pretty good, pretty good. At 73 votes, we have

665
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,640
Mr. Tom Oliver. Yeah, I'm an easy hate. So you might have noticed, most of the least hated people

666
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:49,160
are on this podcast and I have a feeling the other two participants might be on the other end of the

667
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:57,000
list. Let's find out. All righty. I think this is, it's like sixth place, whatever. It's Digibro

668
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,640
at 73 votes. Digibro and Tom are tied at 73 votes. Oh, really? Oh, shit. What do you know?

669
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:08,520
Their destined bond continues to this day. It's true. All right, the fifth most hated member

670
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,360
is Endless Jess at 85. You know, Jess was leading that poll for a while, so all things

671
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:19,080
considered, I think he came out pretty, pretty well, pretty well. Good job, Jesse. We have

672
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,720
Davout at 92 votes. What can you hate about Davout? These are all, so far, those are all

673
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:34,200
people with less than 100. Now we go to the people with the big votes, baby. I'm ready,

674
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:43,640
I'm ready. Lay it on me. Tied for second place at 133 votes each is both Mr. Ben Saint and Mr.

675
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:52,600
Munchy. Our union continues to this day. Our spicy bro pack. I was really sad. I was really

676
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,680
sad Ben didn't win this one. I was really rooting for Ben. I voted for Ben on all my devices that

677
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:06,440
I could. I really did. I really did. And the undisputed most hated PCP member with 163 votes

678
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:16,040
is Munchy Jones. I did it. I won. I'm so proud of this accomplishment. Is he just gone?

679
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,480
You totally cut out there. Just repeat that whole thing. Well, they all heard it, but it's me,

680
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:30,520
Munchy Jones, I won. Yeah, Munchy Jones did it. Way to go. You are. What our audience didn't

681
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,120
realize with that poll is that you're not allowed to hate any of us, so you're all dead. We're

682
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,880
going to kill you all. You're all turning into ghosts. You're all banned. You're all going

683
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,160
ghost. We should have done the second poll so we'd have the other results. Maybe this week

684
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,400
we'll do the opposite poll and see how that goes. That's good. Wait, wait, wait. Before we go to

685
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,000
questions, Ghostbusters 2 is my favorite movie of all time besides the other ones that I like a lot.

686
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,280
For a lot of reasons. Number one, Slimers there. Number two, there's a sea of slime. There's like

687
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:03,240
a ton of slime. Number three, they use slime to control the Statue of Liberty, much like how I

688
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,160
use my influences with slime to destroy and dismantle local government and slowly take over

689
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:14,360
the country. And control women. Yeah, and control women and blacks and whites, especially white

690
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:21,320
people. And, you know, I just control everyone with my intense charisma, my intense slime based

691
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,040
charisma. Dude, dude, fucking the Power Rangers first movie has so much slime in it. It was the

692
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,160
big giant slime man. Dude, I would probably love that. I would probably love that. No, you should

693
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,080
definitely watch that. Slime controls people and it's great. It wasn't slime though, it was ooze.

694
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,760
Our close allies at the very least. Yeah. By the way guys, if you smash centipedes,

695
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:46,040
then you'll get like a couple EXP and you'll get mad slime. So fresh all the centipedes you can.

696
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,120
Reach into your spine and then tear out the centipedes. Control on your thoughts. Oh no.

697
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:56,360
Oh God, don't. Don't pull out that Toblerone folks. Leave it alone in there. And Ghostbusters 2

698
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:02,680
is also good because like a baby almost dies. Fantastic. Yes. All right, let's go to our questions.

699
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:11,240
All right, here we go everybody. Here's number one at Adamualpha asks thoughts on crystal Pepsi.

700
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,520
Did you try it? Did you like it? Are you a fan of the concept of clear cola in general? Love

701
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,080
how specific this one is. This is a great question. He's really obsessed with crystal Pepsi. He

702
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:26,680
loves this disgust. I love the idea of crystal Pepsi of cola that is clear. I think it's the

703
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,000
coolest thing in the world. Isn't that what's seven up in sprite art? Well, those aren't cola. Those

704
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,480
are like fruit drinks instead, you know. Oh, okay. I've never tried crystal Pepsi, but I would love

705
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,640
to. Does it have a different flavor or is it the same thing? It's got to taste different, right?

706
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,040
Have any of us actually tried this? Has anyone tried crystal Pepsi? I have not. None of us have.

707
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,200
Wait, wait. I haven't tried it, but I would say to this person who asked this question,

708
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:58,920
check out the Examined Life of Gaming YouTube channel. He makes reviews of sodas. He's called

709
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:05,880
the new do review. I think he tried crystal Pepsi in a recent video, like it was a new thing.

710
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:12,040
And he tried it and he reviewed it. He reviewed sodas and video games and you might like what he

711
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:17,400
has to say. Pretty great. Fantastic. He's got a place to go for his crystal Pepsi fandom.

712
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:23,960
All right. Well, I have never tried crystal Pepsi. I have about, you know, I would say about 48 bottles

713
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,120
here all blessed by a priest. So they're holy holy water. Is this what you use instead of actual

714
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,200
crystals? Because you can't afford them? Yeah. Yeah, I can't afford the actual crystals. They're

715
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,600
too hard to mine from Africa and I don't want to wind up dead in a ditch trying to get them. So I'm

716
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,640
as old, you know, there's a body tone of crystal Pepsi. I mean, it has crystal in the name. So,

717
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,080
you know, it's probably the same properties. Yeah. So I just pour that all over my body

718
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:52,360
when I'm trying to get an extra boost. It's good plan. Good plan. Yeah. Okay, here we go.

719
01:05:52,360 --> 01:06:00,360
Questions from the world's greatest procrastinators fan artist, Ms. At Jane Moreau asks, do you guys

720
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:06,280
like camping? It's Jane Moreau, yeah. What did I say? Did I say J? You said Jane. I said

721
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,760
why would I say Jane? Oh, I fucked. Okay, I'm sorry, Jade. I love your work, Jade. At Jane Moreau

722
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:18,360
says, do you guys like camping slash hiking? Who's who's a camp guy? No, are we all city boys? We

723
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,360
all city slickers here. I have camped. I have camped a couple times. Quite a few times in a tent

724
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:31,320
and shit. And I do love, I do love a big old, if I see a hill and I got some shoes and they're not

725
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,360
wet shoes and they're like good walking shoes, I will climb all the way to the top of that hill

726
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,480
and then all the way back down and be like, oh, I don't know why I did that, but I like it. So I

727
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:47,800
love hiking. It's fun because I just, you know, it's good. So I guess I do like it. Yeah, I don't

728
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:54,120
mind going for a nice little nature hike or to go exploring, but there's no excuse to ever

729
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,720
sleep anywhere other than my comfy bed. Why would I want to sleep outside in the dirt?

730
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:07,640
It's pretty not good, but I appreciate the feeling of waking up in really early two to the

731
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:13,480
birdsong and the cold air and it's like, oh yeah, yeah, early man. I'm like coming out of my cave

732
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:20,360
and with my sticks and stones, I'm gonna build my life. Let me tell you guys, I was in the Boy Scouts

733
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:26,200
for a thousand years, Eagle Scout represent, and I did a thousand camping trips, did a thousand hikes,

734
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,320
mountain climbing, skiing, all that kind of shit. I love camping. I think camping is super

735
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,720
fucking fun. The only thing that's kind of a pain is you kind of got to like put time aside for it,

736
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,600
but I mean, I'll take any excuse I can get to get out of nature because I just don't

737
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,640
experience it whatsoever. I fucking love going camping and sleeping in there. I mean, I'm a guy

738
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,720
who can sleep anywhere pretty comfortably. So like the whole sleeping thing is never a problem for me.

739
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,880
I don't mind the kind of fucking bugs. I don't mind. I like sitting on my tent. I like cooking

740
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,840
outdoors on my grill. I fucking love everything about it. I haven't done all that sort of like

741
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,440
intense like doing everything yourself sort of thing because when I go camping, it's like with

742
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,320
a big camp troop. Like I said, that's the agunary thing I was talking about. They have a kitchen

743
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:14,360
tent and they make breakfast for everyone and you have patrol tents and stuff. When you just sit

744
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,360
down, you can just play with a Rubik's Cube while you wait for the next activity or something,

745
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:24,600
but like literally going on a quest into the wilderness and living off like a can of beans.

746
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:31,320
I'm not sure I could do that, but I do that without going into the woods. I'm the bean boy. Yeah. Okay.

747
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,800
Well, when I was a little kid for like school, you had to like go on a camping trip like that was

748
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:43,320
like there was like a camping trip a week that everyone went to a camp. And one of the many

749
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,920
misadventures I had, the most interesting one was I, there was like a sculpture class where you

750
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,520
got like a rock and you were supposed to mold it into something. I got a twig, I got some tape,

751
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,720
and I just made a hammer and I threatened to kill anyone who looked at me. Well, that's sick dog.

752
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,280
Let's go to Jade's other question here. Hair goals. She simply states hair goals. Question

753
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:13,720
mark in one word. Who's got hair goals? Gabe, do you have any hair? You're a hair guy. What are your

754
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:20,280
goals? I have hair on my head. I, my goals are to keep it long until it starts thinning too much

755
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,120
and then shaving it all off because I don't want to be like a bolding guy. I just want to go straight

756
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,320
from having long hair to being bold. I don't want to go through that. That's going to be a big change.

757
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:32,440
That's going to be a transformation. Yeah. And then when I'm like got no hair, I'm going to grow my

758
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,440
beard out. So I'm going to be like opposite. I'm going to have a big beard, big bushy beard.

759
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,880
And that's going to be like my hair just, you know, swelled round. That's what happened. It's

760
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:45,240
like, it's like a 3D model that just sort of glitched out the hair bit. When Gib gets older,

761
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:51,640
losing his hair, he like a 3D model. Okay, that's enough of that. Yeah, that's a good song.

762
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,760
He'll become Heisenberg. Yeah. Anyone else have hair goals? I got none. I'm just going to do

763
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,480
exactly what I'm doing. It's fine. I don't care. I want to get better facial hair. I've tried

764
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,360
product. It doesn't work. My face is perpetually broken and it really pisses me off every time I

765
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,240
see Gib's glorious beard. I just want to like cut it off and tape it on my face and pretend

766
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:16,760
that's the best I'll ever get. It sucks. I hate it. I totally forgot about that. But yeah,

767
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,680
I can't grow a decent beard. So one day when I'm an old ass man, I want a big Dumbledore beard.

768
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:26,760
That'd be sick. I want that now. If I could go full Gandalf now, I would like not even. I could

769
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:33,080
potentially get a Dumbledore beard. Oh my God. Hey, you. Yeah. One of those 16 people who voted

770
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,640
it was me. It was me. I voted because you had the beard.

771
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:43,480
And like if we get soup in it and twigs and it'd be horrible, horrible.

772
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,840
Fuck you. I want to look exactly like Steven Sugar besides the beard part.

773
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,440
Is that Rebecca Sugar's husband? Yeah. Brother, but close enough. Basically the same.

774
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,200
They had the same sort of leadership. Hey, I've got a question

775
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,960
from at Bottle Cape. And I really wish Jess was here because he has the best answer,

776
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,440
but we'll do it without him. What do you think of your audiences and what do you think of each

777
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:19,800
other's? Uh oh. Well, I think my audience, the give and take audiences like that, they're nice

778
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,040
people that, you know, I like them. They're good. They're nice and the hypocrite audiences like people

779
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:30,840
who they don't really know anything, but they're not dumb, but they're just sort of like oblivious

780
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,280
to the internet as a whole. And I'm like, well, you know, you stumbled upon this because you're,

781
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:43,880
you know, the YouTube algorithm gave you my video because you're English and you also clicked on it

782
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,880
because it's like something you know. So I got a lot of English fans who don't really know the

783
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:53,640
internet very well. But yeah, they're cool. You got a lot of, you got a lot of like Mary Poppins

784
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,600
who were like, oh, what's this computer box? I'll try to click on it and watch the game reviews.

785
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:05,320
Oh, these are some silly children. Yeah, exactly true. Yes. If you look at your demographics,

786
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:11,320
it's like male, female, and then Mary Poppins is a third part of that. Yeah, epic joke. Okay.

787
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:17,960
Let me see. Monkey, your audience is full of misogynistic, racist, bigoted pieces of shit.

788
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,600
They're the worst people because they follow their leader. They know what you want and they

789
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:28,360
follow suit you. You did this, you're bad. If anybody here has an audience full of leader

790
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,000
followers, it's literally everybody but me. You think so? I click on any of your guys' videos.

791
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,280
It's an 80% like ratio to the views. That's true. Every comment is, oh, man, I love you. I can't

792
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,720
wait to buy one of your fucking stupid mugs even though the month was over. Oh, you go to my channel.

793
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:49,640
It's like almost no likes. It's probably 20% likes for the views. And every fucking top comment is,

794
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:57,880
hey, monkey, fuck you. Hey, monkey, this video is fucking shit. Yeah, I know. I mean, I encourage it,

795
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,800
but I'm not going to say that they're following the leader as opposed to your fucking,

796
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:07,880
your drones and your audience is over there. Your audience is, they suck your dick way too hard.

797
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,600
I don't get it. The thing with my audience, it's developing a bit like Jesse's where like,

798
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,560
the only thing I do is shit on them and tell them that they're gay. But I also

799
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,320
give them like life advice. So they, it's like a, it's like a push pull going on there.

800
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:26,200
And I think it makes, it endears myself to them, you know? I think there's some of that going on,

801
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:44,440
which is good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel the same way about myself. Like when I see someone

802
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,680
who's got really great content, I'm like, yeah, I'm on board with this guy. I want to be like them.

803
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,280
Of course, I mostly overdoing that because I've been on YouTube for a while now. And

804
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:57,880
like that's that was with John Tron. And then, oh boy, then it turns out he's a goddamn bigot,

805
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,080
a goddamn racist. And no, I'll, all that matters is that his content's boring. That's the only

806
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,400
guy. Have you guys seen the rumors that he's working at Bed Bath and Beyond now?

807
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:13,320
That can't be true. What? He keeps posting pictures of products at Bed Bath and Beyond,

808
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,040
but he's behind the register. I'm going to go check this out. I don't believe that. He's got

809
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:23,160
three million subscribers for fuck's sake. All he has to do is just make good. That would be

810
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:29,480
unfortunate, but also rent is very expensive in New York. I was about to think like, oh,

811
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:34,840
that's funny. He's fallen on hard times. Wait, that's kind of sad. That is kind of sad. I don't

812
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:41,160
believe it. I don't, I do not believe it. How is he making money, Tom? He hasn't made a video in

813
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,960
three months. Okay, I was, I was actually looking this up the other day.

814
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,240
I heard he makes like, I heard he makes like $25,000 per video. That might be a totally made up

815
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:58,040
number, but like, he does a lot of like ad stuff and sponsorship, and he gets paid a substantial

816
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,520
amount per video that he does, as I understand it. I mean, that's made up number, so. I hate talking

817
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,320
about Jon Tron, fuck that guy, he's gay. Yeah, I mean, really, the only thing I care about is he

818
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:12,520
doesn't make good content anymore, so I don't care. So fuck that guy. My, my audience to go back to

819
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:21,960
that is like small and cult like and very devout and very like superstitious and easily manipulated

820
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,040
and just you're describing half of the PCP audience. I mean, there's a lot of overlap there,

821
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,600
you know, a lot of overlap. Yeah, when they say there's a new arm retrieval, they're like,

822
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:36,920
yes! Oh my fucking god. It's time. That's been like unironically like that. For a while now,

823
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:45,320
so I hope they're happy. I am unironically one of those types. For red matter media.

824
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:52,120
That's dude, I'm the biggest red matter media fan in the world. Yeah, it's pretty great. I love

825
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:57,880
them all. They're a little bit too meme-y for my taste, which may sound funny, but you know, I'm

826
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:03,880
not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I, contrary to popular belief, I'm not the biggest meme guy. I think,

827
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:11,320
I think they're fine, but I'm not, I'm not the biggest meme guy. Hillary, I love you.

828
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:16,120
Not Hillary. No. Uh, Momke, can you, I'm sorry, Munchy, can you just do me a favor? Can you give

829
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:21,320
us a quick average value? You know, don't acknowledge it. Uh, if you, what, what, what would you say is

830
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:26,120
the average Christ consciousness of your audience, you know, as, as a whole, what would you put that

831
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:33,160
pretty low, pretty low? No, they got some work to do. One or two. Okay. Okay. So maybe, you know,

832
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:39,320
like level one or two. Yeah. Uh, there's probably like a few fours in there. All right, you guys,

833
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:44,920
like, like a, you know, high five to a low six. Okay, good. All right, not bad. Well, cool. Um,

834
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,920
how about you, Tom? What do you think about your audience?

835
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:54,680
Mm hmm. Yeah, they got pretty mad at you. Hey,

836
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:02,440
hey.

837
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,440
Ah, yeah.

838
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,000
Mm hmm. That seems to be the way to go.

839
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,600
I'm, I'm just gonna be more potent, Tom. You're not potent.

840
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,560
You know, I've really been thinking about it and I've come to the conclusion that, um,

841
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,000
what's the benevolent fuck? What is it? It's like the benevolent dictator is really the best kind

842
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,480
of system of government you can hope for. And I've elected myself to this office. So I'm going to

843
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:56,840
use my, yeah, that's of course, of course. So I'm going to use my, my objectively best ideas

844
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:02,360
and create a cult like falling around myself and, and make and indoctrinate them with the best ideas.

845
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,760
They'll just be sheep, you know, they'll just be doing exactly what I tell them,

846
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,200
but little do they know I have their best interests in mind as well as the world.

847
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,200
And that's how it's going to go. And it's going to work out great.

848
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:17,480
I don't really want to get into a big thing, but every time I see like people saying you're like

849
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:23,880
literally like God and then like this into Jesse. Well, you know, like similar sort of things. I'm

850
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:29,240
like, why don't people do that to me? And then I see on my videos, they do kind of do that to me.

851
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:34,120
And I just realized that I look at other people's comments on their videos more than I look at my

852
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:39,720
own because I don't make any fucking videos. Yeah, you know, that's why I don't have like a fan base.

853
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,280
I have like a couple of people who are PCP fans on their occasion. They're like, Oh yeah, Gibb's cool.

854
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:49,240
Yeah, I like Gibb's stuff. And then, you know, they go back to not having watched any of my videos

855
01:18:49,240 --> 01:19:01,080
because there are none. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.

856
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:16,360
Yeah. Yeah. It's it's kind of the kind of great kind of great people make PCP fan art, you know,

857
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:21,560
it's time. It's time to put the money where your dig is draw the shit. I think I think I think Tom needs

858
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:26,840
to Tom needs to be like in a in one of the many double podcasts that we have. We need we need a Tom

859
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:33,240
plus a one podcast. Me and Tom are going to do a depression suicide podcast. That's a good one.

860
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,320
That's a good one. Oh, by the way, before we get away from the topic, I just wanted to say that

861
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:43,320
about the whole like your audience really giving a shit, like I think that's a consequence of like

862
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,520
the audience reacts with strong emotions, too strong emotions like shown in the video. And I'm

863
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:54,040
a big like shouty boy and and like you're you're less of that. So like I'm a subtle boy. I love

864
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,720
your content, but I just think it's kind of like the nature of like people like, yeah,

865
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:02,680
oh, this guy's yelling, I want to yell my money right into his wallet. You know, that's that's

866
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:10,680
that's the way you can do like there's I it's working for me. Jesse was always like a big

867
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,600
passion guy and people got really passionate into his stuff. And like did did you was more of like

868
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,920
just like an absurdly prolific guy and people just like felt immersed in his content that like

869
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,120
achieves a similar sort of effect. And you know, if you could find you can do one of those and

870
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,640
I think it's a good way to go. And I and I'm sort of a chuckle boy, they come to me, they just

871
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:35,240
chuckle, they just type haha. And they leave. I think another thing more content. Another thing

872
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:40,520
to think about also is that like I'm a die hard red letter media fan, but I have never in my life

873
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,000
commented on one of their videos. So I mean, I think for every good commenter you get, there's

874
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,240
probably 20 people who love you just as much, if not more so, but they just they just don't

875
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,160
comment because they don't care about typing shit out. You know, I comment on like videos with

876
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,880
low numbers of comments, I guess, because I feel like I don't know that it matters more, I guess.

877
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,480
Like I've yeah, I also just I'm realizing I've never commented on one of their videos, even though

878
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:06,680
I consume everything they make because they're fucking love it so much. And yeah, that's interesting.

879
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:10,040
I have bought a bunch of their merch though, which I think is telling I was willing to spend money

880
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:16,120
on their shit. That's true. I think about that, like I wouldn't comment on one of their videos

881
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:21,080
because I don't expect them to read the comments at all. Yeah, yeah. So I don't think they would

882
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,840
ever get anything out of what I would put down. So I don't I mean, that's why I don't leave comments

883
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:30,120
in general. But when it's like, you know, one of you and I feel like, well, I could say this on

884
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,920
on discord or whatever, but it would make sense for it to be in public so people could see what

885
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,240
I'm saying as well. Yeah, I put a comment on there because I know that you would read it.

886
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,680
So I don't know. That makes sense.

887
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:51,880
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's nice. Comments are cool. The only comments I like are when Nate comments

888
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:57,080
on my Yu-Gi-Oh series. Otherwise, I don't give a shit. Monkey, you forgot you were distracted

889
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:02,280
from the tits. You have to go back. I commented like every day for like two weeks about that shit.

890
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:09,800
By the way, I want to real quick here encourage, you know, fan arts great. It's fine. It's I

891
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:17,800
like it a lot. But if you make songs or something, fan songs is greater than fan art objectively.

892
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,680
Most of the time. Most of the time. Sure. Sure. It's cool. I love that shit. I make them.

893
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:28,840
So yeah, fan songs are great. Any sort of fan project art is great. You don't have to just

894
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,560
be an art guy. If you anything you can offer is great. Anything that you can alter to the

895
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:40,040
alter of Munchie. You know those ring far like to worship me. I will appreciate those PCP

896
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:44,040
openings that those guys are making the anime openings for the PCP that were a big while back.

897
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:50,280
Those are great. Yeah. You know what? We don't have like a remix of our ending theme of the PCP.

898
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:58,760
Well, other than the ones you make, I'm supposed to be crapping my pants, you know, those.

899
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:06,040
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot about that. Yeah. Somebody made like a I remember now

900
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,640
like an orchestrated version. It was great. It was good. It was good. It was uploaded by me on Reddit.

901
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:21,160
Well, I certainly would have if I had been aware of it. I don't know. We should check though.

902
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:29,640
That's true. Okay, let's go to let's go to some other questions here. Okay, here's one from

903
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:35,880
at strange CIG asks, why is Ben St. still alive? I don't know, dude. I've been worrying. I've been

904
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,720
wondering about that question for a long time. I've been worrying about that fact for a while.

905
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,640
Yeah. Wasn't that our $2,000 Patreon goal was kill Ben?

906
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,480
That's yeah, he's like a starfish. You break Ben in half, you just get two more Ben. So,

907
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,600
you know, I don't really know if we want to go down that road. He's trucking along,

908
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:59,160
bro. He's trucking along. He's trucking along. He's trucking. Oh my god. It'll be out by now,

909
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:04,200
but apparently the word on the street is a week ago when this comes out, the new fucking Nuzloc

910
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:09,000
ending to his genocide run is going to be out tomorrow for when we're recording this. I've

911
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,920
been waiting for it. I'm the biggest fan of that in the world. I can't fucking wait. Then he could

912
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:19,080
die. Then he could die. Imagine if that comes out and it's just like a HD remake of the first

913
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,760
Nuzloc you did. Like the back video. Gotcha. Yeah. That would be very interesting.

914
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:32,280
Well, I know that it's not because I'm a guest star on the episode. Oh man, I'm so excited.

915
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,800
Very hype. Ben and I had talked a bunch about it because I'd been like, oh, Ben,

916
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,120
I want you to do this. I want you to do this on the fucking thing. I've been being a creepy fan

917
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:46,360
of that Nuzloc. Okay. Okay. Here's the last question. We got one more from our good buddy,

918
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:53,560
the deadmine on Exilevich asks, oh shit, what are some of the worst jobs you've ever had? I know

919
01:24:53,560 --> 01:25:03,400
some of Tom's. I don't want to Tom's. Yeah.

920
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:29,400
Yeah. Yeah.

921
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,400
Okay. Fair point.

922
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:46,920
Well, I am in between leaving school and going to uni. I had a year where I didn't know what

923
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:53,080
the fuck I was going to do. And I was just depressed. And I was forced to work volunteer work

924
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,400
to buy the government because that's how you get

925
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:06,520
because you're unemployed or whatever. And I had to sign an online form to like tell you people

926
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:15,960
sign up for this shit, idiot. I was a young boy. I still am really, but I typed in the wrong

927
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:22,280
county and well, not county, just sort of the wrong sort of area, the wrong town.

928
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:29,560
And they sent the forum online. Then they sent me because I typed the wrong town,

929
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,720
the commute was like a two hour bus drive all the way. Yeah, I told it before.

930
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:41,320
And working in that place, it was like a charity shop. And I had to like work in the back,

931
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:48,760
shoveling shit and deciding what the bags of trash that people send in, you got to

932
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,680
sift through it and find stuff and sort it out. And you know, that was boring. But that was at

933
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:01,400
least work. A lot of the time I was told to man the store, which meant just standing in the store,

934
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:08,200
there were no seats, there wasn't a seat behind the register. So I just had to just walk around and

935
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:12,600
sort of lie on the floor occasionally because my legs hurt. Yeah, I've been there. And I did that

936
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,440
for hours and I didn't like it and I didn't get paid and I ran away at one point. You don't get

937
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:27,640
paid for that at work? It was like the law was like, if you want job seekers allowance, if you

938
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:33,080
want grants for not having a job and you're looking for a job, you have to do a minimum of a

939
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:44,600
certain like, like three, four days of volunteer work a week. Yeah.

940
01:27:44,600 --> 01:28:06,200
Yeah, yeah. So it was, it was, it was my first real experience of like a nine to five. And it was

941
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,440
so boring just standing in that shop because nobody really came in. And I didn't really sell

942
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:16,600
anything. I was just sort of waiting, you know, waiting to die. I was glad when I just didn't

943
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:25,400
come in and broke the rules. Way to go, dude. Excellent. My hardest job that I ever worked was

944
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:31,560
not going, was never not having, I'd never had a job before. That was the hardest job I've ever done.

945
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:38,600
A wee lad, a wee lad. When the hell put you to work, boy? I'll put that butt to work. Oh no, dad, don't

946
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:45,560
get out your belt. Munchies. Munchie, for you. Specifically, since you're a school man, did you,

947
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,840
did you ever have like a terrible homework that you just hated so much?

948
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:57,000
Literally every single homework. Homework is the work, I would rather go to school all day. Like,

949
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,280
like for like, for like 12 hour school days than do a single piece of homework.

950
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:13,960
Okay, just imagine being, yeah, the homework is fucking retarded. Yeah.

951
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:28,680
Yeah, yeah. I used to try, I used to try like when I first got into secondary school, I used to try

952
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,720
thinking, all right, I got to get on top of this homework. I hated homework all through primary

953
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:37,960
school. This time, I'm going to do the homework before I come, before I walk home, because I

954
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:43,880
walked home every day. And so, you know, the first few days I managed to do the stupid homework,

955
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:51,800
which is draw a page and do some words. And then I drew that and wrote some shit. And then I went

956
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,440
home and then, you know, obviously homework gets more and more and more and more. And I was like,

957
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:03,320
yeah. It just sort of became impossible to do it before I went home, because it would have been

958
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:10,120
like, oh yeah, just stay at school for two hours and have no friends. You know, I, yeah, I hear

959
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:15,480
you. I've had some shitty jobs myself over the years. I worked at Best Buy for a while. That

960
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,720
wasn't like that bad, but it was like retail and I hate, I fucking hate pushing things on people,

961
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:27,320
not downvoted. I worked at several pizza places. I worked at Papa Geno's, which is like a chain in

962
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:32,840
Massachusetts and like the Northeast region. Oh yeah. Nothing beats Papa Geno's besides an all-out

963
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:39,560
race war. I'm actually, I love Papa Geno's pizza. God, I would kill for some. It's so thin. It's

964
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:47,480
the thin. It's delicious. Okay. I know, I know. Gibbs is very concerned about that. I worked at

965
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:52,120
another pizza place that was like a mom and pop one that was, it was okay. It was kind of shitty.

966
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:56,200
I worked a bunch of like temp jobs, like after I, you know, the last like four years when I was

967
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:01,560
like doing stuff, when I was doing pony stuff, I worked at like, just like a temp agency being hired

968
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,080
for various jobs. It was never very good at them. Oh, it was all garbage. Did you demand they call

969
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:12,920
you keg? Of course. Okay. I'll just wrap up my point. I just wanted to say that like about my

970
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:19,800
current job. So my current job is not like the worst job in terms of like the hardest or I don't

971
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:25,800
know any of that shit, but like what makes it a unique challenge is like it's a real, it's a real

972
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,920
job. Like I'm a member of a team working on shit and like there are expectations of me. So like

973
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,280
when there's work to be done, it has to get done. Nothing else matters. Like there is no excuses to

974
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,520
like not do your shit. If you got to spend an entire weekend working on something to get it

975
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,200
fucking working for the Monday morning meeting, that's how you're spending your weekend now.

976
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,920
And that's exactly what I have to do this weekend and is what I will be doing as soon as we're done

977
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,840
fucking recordings. I have to fucking finish this program. It probably won't even be used in the end,

978
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:59,080
but I literally, that's what I'm getting. Yeah, that's like part of what I get paid for though,

979
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:04,360
that like I'm basically on call that I have to just do whatever. It doesn't happen most of the

980
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,400
time, but sometimes it does. And when it does, it's the worst and interferes with the things I

981
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,560
actually want to be doing with my life. But okay, whatever. That's enough of that.

982
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,080
Let me just quit your job and don't get on Patreon either. Just go away.

983
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:18,920
I'll just die. Yeah, patreon.com slash best guy ever. People set me free. Okay. Next is

984
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,520
what we say in time. What was your horrific nightmare job?

985
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,880
Hmm. Yeah, yeah.

986
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,080
That's cool. Yeah.

987
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,320
Oh, Lord.

988
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:16,120
Mm-hmm.

989
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,120
Cool.

990
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:58,360
Oh, at that point, tell them to fuck off. Yeah, that's too much. So how long did you do it for?

991
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,000
Just two weeks.

992
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,240
What the fuck?

993
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,960
These people didn't know what the fuck they're doing.

994
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:27,240
Yeah, that's uh, what the fuck? Okay. Well, cool. Dope.

995
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,080
Well, I didn't monkey have anything to say. No, he didn't.

996
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,560
The worst job I've ever had is, um, once every week or two, I get on this fucking podcast full

997
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:42,920
of these autistic little faggots. And I, I, I pretend to put up with their stupid bullshit

998
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,840
for like an hour and a half and then I get paid like what 20 bucks for it. Oh, whoop-de-dee,

999
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,800
what a great fucking gig. Kill me. 20 bucks for an hour ain't bad. Okay. Well, um, uh,

1000
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:57,560
fuck, what was I gonna say? Something important. I don't fucking know, whatever I give up.

1001
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:03,320
Subscribe to Monkey Jones. Yeah, that's, that's the thing to do. Do that. Uh, I guess we're done.

1002
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:10,200
Subscribe to Monkey Jones. Hey, yeah. I just couldn't think of my own name. Shout out to,

01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,920

1004
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:20,040
I didn't read them. So, uh, keep working, guys. Keep working on that shit. Shout out to ghosts.

1005
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:25,640
Shout out to ghosts. Yeah. Yo, Danny Fenton, he was just 14 when his parents got a very strange

01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,760

1015
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:22,040
They love it when you do that. Yeah, that's a good idea. Have they said anything about it?

1016
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,440
Are they freaking out? I hope they're crying. I hope they're upset.

1017
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:36,600
Oh my God. Yeah. Dude, I want that fucking PR rep lady to like respond to those.

1018
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,160
Fuck you. That goddamn idiot. She's so much shit. Well, I think, I think if they actually be all

1019
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:45,640
cheeky and coy with it, I'd prefer that to them like being sincerely like that.

1020
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:52,280
Like if they're being sarcastic, like, oh, I love a fucking logo, you prick. If they're like that,

1021
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:58,680
then I'm like, okay, they have like a soul, but I still hate you. Yeah. Go back. We have to go

1022
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:05,000
back. Taren. Hashtag. We have to go back to PCP. Oh, your logo is so good. I mean, pod. Yeah, whatever.

1023
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:13,320
We're still going to use that goddamn thing. It's going to exist. I'm going to sell it,

1024
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:18,520
whether I like it or not. No, we have not. It's not been done yet.

1025
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,520
I know we're letting it slip away. We have to do it like immediately. So we need to

1026
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:28,280
fucking do this shit. Okay. Things are happening, folks. We're going to get on this shit.

1027
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,520
Hopefully we'll have some updates. Oh, wait, wait, someone else did a question.

1028
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,880
Shit. No, just let it out. Okay. This was just relevant. This was just like somebody

1029
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,320
added a question. I'm sorry. I can't find it, but they just asked like, Hey, what's the status with

1030
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:43,560
the iTunes? I just want to let everybody know like the iTunes thing. Okay. So we've had a couple

1031
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,240
issues. There's been some problems getting it set up. It's entirely on me. I just have had

1032
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:53,080
and had the time because of me and Mavin shit to fix it. So iTunes is coming someday soon. So

1033
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,880
just stick around. It'll happen at some point. There you go. Okay. That's the end. Thanks for

1034
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:03,080
the list, everybody. What's up? No, no, no. We'll say goodbye, but I need to sync.

1035
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:06,680
Oh, okay. Yeah. We'll sync before we add. Okay. Thanks for this, everybody. We'll see you next time.

1036
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:12,440
Make sure you send more questions. Use the hashtag. Hashtag ask PCP. Bye.
