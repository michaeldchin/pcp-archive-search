00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,240
the best guy ever. Oh, who's in the Rapscallion crew today? Nope, it's Gibbontake. What's

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
up?

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,520
It's me, the host of the show. I'm the main attraction. The guy who can fire you all with

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,600
a moment's hand wave. His managerial powers are unparalleled. We've got Ben Saint. Who?

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,040
Don't ask me. I'm sorry, what? I thought we killed him. Tom Oliver, welcome. Welcome

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,280
again. Did you know that I have a long running podcast series on my Patreon? 23 episodes so

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,240
far and more, new one every week, new I am Games video coming out in three days, probably

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,080
out by the time you hear this. Go give me money and watch. My spine is back. My will

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,120
is back. Everything is back. Back puns. Get it? I'm back. Let's do it.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,320
Tom Oliver pulled off an epic Zandatsu, stealing and crushing those electrolytes from his enemies,

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,880
and now he's stronger than ever.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes, it was fucking great. That's what I have to do tomorrow. I'm going in for a post-op

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,960
tomorrow and I have to crush my surgeon's spine and get the electrolytes to finish

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
the...

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,200
You can only graduate if you show that your spine is stronger than his.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Yes.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,440
Well, so we got a mage, of course. A mage is here. Hello.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,800
Hey, hello, Pokemon. Am I right, guys? I want to talk about it.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,960
T-minus five days. When you hear this, it will be out, I think.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, that's why I want you to bring it up.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Let me just stop for one second and say that I was so mad yesterday on Twitter. I saw that

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,640
the trending hashtag was like, thank you, hashtag thank you, Game Freak. And I just

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,520
thought that was so vile, so utterly loathsome.

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't care. They're a fucking business. They do not deserve your love. If you like

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
their products, cool.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,280
Oh, let's celebrate. Let's celebrate how much money they extracted from us.

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,200
There was the inevitable backlash, because everyone was mad at Game Freak for fucking

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,760
up the National Dex, but now that that dust has settled on that, people are now swinging

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
in the other direction.

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Oh, yeah. Oh, maybe they fucked it up and ruined everything, but oh, but they're giving

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,400
us a new game, though. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, master.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,120
Can I have another, please?

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Look, I'm in, look, Ben, they cut, they cut scissor, all right? They fucking cut scissor

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
for the fucking game.

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Thank you for only belting me across the face 23 times instead of the traditional 24, sir.

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,560
Everybody, let's clap, consume product and then consume next product.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Yay.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Okay, but Mega Gigantamax Gengar is really funny looking at you like that. He's really

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,640
funny. And Google it, you know, let's find an image. He's, he's, he's like doing that

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,320
thing where he's like, he's like in the ground, like Mega Gengar, but like only the top half

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,440
of his mouth is like open like a big cave in front of you. Can you, can you like that?

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Fuck?

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Ben, it's sick. It's totally dope.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
No.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
I'm just ignoring all of that. I'm just like Corviknight.

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Please look at this Gengar.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm sticking to my guns. Still, still Corviknight is badass and is one of my favorite people

50
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
in the world.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
I don't even remember who Corviknight is.

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Corviknight is the, the fucking Demo Dark Goth bird.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
It's, it's the Goth, it's the Victorian Dark Souls bird.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Yeah.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Isn't it, isn't it weird when they present like Corviknight was like first introduced

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,680
and you know, we all thought pretty cool, but that's like the third evolution of the

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,720
line and it feels weird to me that they introduced the like third evolution before we ever saw

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
the first or second.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,240
Because they know that the third evolution is the only good one in the line.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,520
I think it's probably because they like doesn't like Corviknight like do something in the

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
lore of this world.

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,520
It's used as like a transport bird all over the place.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
That is true.

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
It's a taxi bird.

65
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Um, okay.

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,520
So, so Gigantamaxing and Dynamaxing are like different things, right?

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Cause I, cause I see, cause I see a Gengar and I'm assuming this is a Dynamax?

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,960
No, wait, wait. Dynamaxing is making the Pokemon big. Gigantamaxing is when they have a specific

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,440
form. Cause I see a giant Dynamax Gengar, but he doesn't look any different from normal.

70
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
So I'm not seeing what you're talking about.

71
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Yeah.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,600
Certain Pokemon can Gigantamax, which is when they get a different form.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Dude, I'm, I'm searching for this right now and I actually cannot find the image I was

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
looking at yesterday.

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Yeah.

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,960
That's just big Gengar, but that's not what I was looking at.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
There was one with Gengar's mouth.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Was it a fan at it?

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Was this not real?

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
No.

81
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
You've been duped.

82
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
It was 3D models.

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Oh, I mean, okay.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
That's really cool, but that's not, that's not what that looks funny as well.

85
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll get back to you.

86
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I love that.

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,480
Gengar is a hilarious great boy and I'm way into him, but you know, whatever, I'll get

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
back to you.

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm just getting my fucking Tyranitar if he's in this game.

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I haven't checked.

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
He's going to get fucking Tyranitar back.

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
He is in the game.

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Tyranitar is in the game.

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,160
And that's the only reason I'm buying this game.

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,320
Oh, that's going to be good.

96
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,320
There was, there was a thing I was, I was thinking the other day, like, you know, some of these

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,960
new Pokemon look pretty good.

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,160
Corviknight, you know, nice, nice looking design.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,880
It's such a shame that it's in a Pokemon game, you know, like that was my first thought.

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,000
Like, what a shame that all these like nice designs are in a game that sucks.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I don't like-

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Damn.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Give with the harsh fruits.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,280
And I'm not saying that, I'm not saying that because like, I'm a, I'm a bandwagon Pokemon

105
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,920
sucks because of this or that.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,600
I just haven't liked Pokemon since Emerald.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
So you know.

108
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,920
I, I was very critical of Sun and Moon as well, because Sun and Moon had tons of stuff

109
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
to infuriate me.

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Sun and Moon was a nice little thing, but that was like the first time I'd played Pokemon

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,320
for like 10 years or something.

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
I got a set.

113
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I have not seen this before.

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,560
Surfetched is fucking awesome.

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,400
It's the evolution of Farfetched.

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
It's so good.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
Oh, with the really long fucking leak.

118
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Yeah.

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I mean, yeah.

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Farfetched finally got an evolution.

121
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Super.

122
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
I can't wait, I can't wait for him to come out in Pokemon Go, so I can just look at him.

123
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
It's always good for.

124
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Yeah.

125
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Yeah.

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
It's going to be in Pokemon Sword Farfetched, I think.

127
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm getting Sword.

128
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
So let, let's just go down the line.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Let's self-segregate as we like to do.

130
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Shield, pony.

131
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Sword boy, sword over here.

132
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Shield.

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Mage.

134
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Pony, pony, pony.

135
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm getting it.

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Fuck it.

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,520
I'm getting Sword, but, but someone's getting it for me as a gift.

138
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
I would not be buying it otherwise.

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I still haven't got to have found a reason to get a switch.

140
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Okay, fair enough.

141
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Fair enough.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
But all the ports give.

143
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Don't you want to pay for game again?

144
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Nope.

145
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I know I do.

146
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Poltergeist is pretty, pretty cute, I guess.

147
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
It is.

148
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I like it.

149
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I like it.

150
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
And it has a pre-evolution that's a little teacup.

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Does it?

152
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Yeah, that one's cute.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't see that.

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Poltergeist.

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Yeah, it's, it's a T.

156
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
It wasn't the leaks.

157
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh, sorry.

158
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I like MLP ponytail a lot.

159
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
That's in shield.

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I mean, that's, you know, that's cute.

161
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I like it.

162
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
What can I say?

163
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Which version has sandile?

164
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
A sandile even in this game?

165
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Am I going to get mad now?

166
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Who knows?

167
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm not sure.

168
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Disgusting.

169
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
They cut scissor.

170
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
They cut scissor.

171
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
And they cut fucking all my favorite Pokemon.

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Scissor is the one who usually does the cutting.

173
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Cause he slice and cut with the HM.

174
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I was like, I was thinking to myself, guys, scissor, incredibly popular Pokemon.

175
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,420
Like one of the most iconic bug, but he's one of the only reasons why anyone likes

176
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,920
bug at all, right?

177
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,920
There's no fucking way they're cutting scissor, right?

178
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
No, it can't be.

179
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,920
There's no, and then I see the big black, red fucking X on his face.

180
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
You know what?

181
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
It's really a shame.

182
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Can't believe it.

183
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,920
That the Pokemon company didn't have the balls to do the really hardcore move and cut Pikachu.

184
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Let's just fucking move on.

185
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
We've had a lot of fucking Pikachu's.

186
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
It's time to move on.

187
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Can you imagine if they just cut Pikachu?

188
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
They just was not there.

189
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,920
There was a, this idea doesn't make sense in practice, but I did see some fan art of

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Mimikyu, right?

191
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
A Gigantamax to Mimikyu.

192
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,920
It sure would be funny if, when a Gigantamax is, it's now wearing a costume of Raichu.

193
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Instead of its costume of Pikachu, but nobody cares about Raichu at all.

194
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,920
People only like Pikachu is that doesn't actually make sense.

195
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Even though Raichu is objectively better.

196
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,920
I have a feeling that Pikachu has like almost all the shares in the company and he's like

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
calling all the shots.

198
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Oh shit.

199
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
He's the Mickey Mouse basically of the Pokemon company.

200
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Yeah.

201
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
That's fair.

202
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Yep.

203
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Yep.

204
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I will get it and I will have at least a kind of decent time as I even do with the worst

205
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Pokemon games.

206
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I'm sure.

207
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Why?

208
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Because I, look, they're making a product and I do want to be part of the conversation

209
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
of the discussion of the game.

210
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
What's that worth?

211
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
And I just enjoy Pokemon.

212
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,920
If you notice that discussion worth when most of it is people going, ugh.

213
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Because frankly, I think you guys are slightly exaggerating how bad this game looks.

214
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Oh no, it's fine.

215
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,920
It's just, it's just like the same old shit and therefore it's like.

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Yeah, I agree.

217
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah.

218
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
You know, Pokemon, whatever.

219
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
They're still going to have A&M's, right?

220
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I like Pokemon and to be honest, I ain't too bothered.

221
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Fuck it.

222
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I don't know.

223
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
No, I don't think so.

224
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Have they removed A&M's from this game?

225
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
There's no way they did.

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I can't remember what their...

227
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
They removed them from Sun and Moon.

228
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I don't think they would...

229
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
They weren't in the last game though.

230
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
They were removed.

231
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Yeah, I'm sure they'll fuck it up.

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm sure they'll only do bad things.

233
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah.

234
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Well, if they have the taxi Pokemon and the Corvik Knight, then there's no reason to have

235
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
flies, so I'm guessing, you know, they're going to remove them.

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Well, they got the whole thing with like open world, you can sit and have a curry or whatever

237
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
and camp out in the wilderness.

238
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Traditional English dish curry.

239
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
So like fast travel might not be a thing.

240
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
But they might have trains.

241
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Have you guys seen this?

242
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I found this.

243
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
It looks kind of legit, but it's really bad.

244
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
It's really low res of like all the new Pokemon or something.

245
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh yeah, that's based on the leaks.

246
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Yeah, I think that's all the ones, at least at this time.

247
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh, Karkol.

248
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Karkol is the best one.

249
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
What's that?

250
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
I hate his eyes.

251
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
He is the middle evolution of the rock faggot thing.

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
The small one looks like another one.

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
The big one looks like Raihorn or whatever.

254
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,920
But the middle one is like a golem head, like decapitated and put it on a bed of coals

255
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,920
on like a stone slab and he's got tiny little leg things.

256
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
And he's got a really stupid expression.

257
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
He's pretty good.

258
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I love how stupid he is.

259
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
The edges of his eyes are protruding.

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I don't like it.

261
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I think I really like...

262
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Have you seen the fucking apple?

263
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Are you seeing this fucking apple on the left?

264
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
It's a fucking apple.

265
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
All right.

266
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,920
I really like the snow version of Darmanitan with its big orb head.

267
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
It's good.

268
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Although I am keen on having Pokémon in my life again, one thing I want to complain

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
though is the Pokémon designs.

270
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,920
I don't want to say they're ugly necessarily, but they don't give me like most of them,

271
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
most of the new ones, don't give me that Pokémon vibe anymore.

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
They kind of look weird.

273
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I mean, look at fucking impendip and his two weird evolutions.

274
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
What is that thing?

275
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Morkrim is like a sex demon, I'm pretty sure.

276
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Did he find a revolution of impendip?

277
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I mean, I think it's that weird purple one.

278
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Oh yeah, the middle one.

279
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
I don't like the green.

280
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Why did he add green?

281
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Otherwise, I would like it otherwise, but that green is just...

282
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Just green screen it away.

283
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Key it out.

284
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
It's okay guys.

285
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
We've got all the original Kanto Pokémon in, so you can just use those exclusively

286
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
like you do every game.

287
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,920
The only ones that anyone cares about.

288
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I know.

289
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Hey, I just want to rent.

290
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I just want to rent for one second.

291
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I hate Goldeen.

292
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I can't believe they put Goldeen in again.

293
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
It is.

294
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
It is.

295
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Probably to fucking kill my Pokémon with Horn Drill again.

296
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
The new evolution of Corsola.

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
The new evolution of Corsola just is the white lady from Hollow Knight.

298
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, and it's dope.

299
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
It's dope.

300
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,920
It's like it turns into Sea King, which is uglier, and it's a generic boring fish

301
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,920
in every single game, but Magikarp also is one of those.

302
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
It turns into a cool thing.

303
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Goldeen is the worst Pokémon in Pokémon.

304
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
That's great.

305
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
That's good lore.

306
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
It's definitely up there.

307
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
No, it gets a horn.

308
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
It's not just a fish.

309
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
It had a horn.

310
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
No, man.

311
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
The horn is consistent between evolutions.

312
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
It's got a horn.

313
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Yeah, yeah.

314
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
It gets a horn.

315
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
That's what I'm saying.

316
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I'm saying it's got a horn though.

317
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
It's not just a fish.

318
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
It's got a horn.

319
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,920
We know you are hung up about horns, Ben, but other people don't have that tism.

320
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Look, I got a horn, but you don't see me waving it around everywhere.

321
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm tugging on my horn right now.

322
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I really don't like Santa Conda.

323
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
It's fucking...

324
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I really don't like Santa Claus.

325
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
This fucking image is small.

326
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Silly snake.

327
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Don't like it.

328
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay, I mean, I've just got...

329
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,420
Have you guys noticed the fucking B-52, like the semi-legendary dragon, ghost type of this,

330
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,920
that launches fucking dragons out of its missile launchers on its fucking stealth jethead?

331
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
No, no, no.

332
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
It's a dragon puts, dragon quits, whatever it is, in the middle there.

333
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't like it.

334
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I mean, I think it's fucked up, but I'm way into it.

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Yeah, I like it.

336
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
I don't know.

337
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I like that one.

338
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I don't like the literal penguin was just an ice cube on its head.

339
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
It's just an ice cube head.

340
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Yeah, that one's actually really bad.

341
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Man, have you seen it?

342
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I thought that was like...

343
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's all just formed directly below it with the melted head.

344
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh, my God.

345
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I'll defend fucking vanillax, and I'll defend clefty, but I think I have to draw the line

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
at ice cube?

347
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Ice cube.

348
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Ice cube.

349
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
It's very bad.

350
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
It's an ice cube with a penguin for a body.

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,920
I mean, aside from obvious habitat things, what is the significance of like a fucking

352
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
mascot looking ice cube?

353
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
That's like what a fucking elementary school I would come up with.

354
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
It really is.

355
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Unironically.

356
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Unironically.

357
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
I don't like it.

358
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
I do like it.

359
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
It's so that purple thing.

360
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Oh, it's all shit, boys.

361
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
We're going to hell in a handbasket.

362
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,420
I guess I'll just say spoilers or whatever, but have you seen the big mega-ultra-legendary

363
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
attorneys or whatever?

364
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I mean, that thing's pretty sick.

365
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
It has a fucking city on its head.

366
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
It looks like a fucking...

367
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,420
What do they call it, an Eldrazi for Magic the Gathering?

368
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
The Cthulhu fucking demons?

369
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Those are pretty sick.

370
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
It's got like two different forms, and it's other...

371
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
I want to know the lore behind that thing.

372
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,420
What the fuck is it?

373
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
I mean, it looks like an Ultra Beast.

374
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,920
You said Eldrazi, and now I just want to play Magic, because it's cooler than this.

375
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,420
It just looks like an Ultra Beast, basically.

376
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
It looks like...

377
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
It does.

378
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
100% true.

379
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
100% true.

380
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
I don't know.

381
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,420
There's like some deep King Arthur lore about like interdimensional Cthulhu demons or something

382
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
that I'm not aware of.

383
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,420
I guess we'll find out soon.

384
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Maybe there's no.

385
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Find out in five days, or after you're listening to this, because it's already out, you can

386
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,420
tell us how we were totally wrong about all these things in the comments.

387
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
I can't wait.

388
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,920
I mean, you know, I'm just thinking back.

389
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Now is the appropriate time.

390
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,420
I'm thinking back to my experience of playing Sun and Moon.

391
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Core gameplay loop.

392
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
You know.

393
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Good.

394
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Fine.

395
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,420
I hated the reduced number of gyms to four, effectively.

396
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,420
There was those trainers that each one around the world was the one elemental boy, but those

397
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
weren't real gyms.

398
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
Wait, and Sun and Moon?

399
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Yeah.

400
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Remember, they were only like...

401
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
No, they had the Kovunas.

402
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
The Trials.

403
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
The Trials.

404
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Yeah, they had the Kovunas with the big boss, and the Babunas, the small ones.

405
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,420
But they also had the guys who would give you the Z-Crystal, the different elemental guys

406
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,420
who were sort of like gym leaders, kinda.

407
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Okay, that all sucked.

408
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't want any of that.

409
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
I just want gyms.

410
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Gyms are classic.

411
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
They're good.

412
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Well, there's definitely gyms in this one.

413
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
We know that.

414
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Thank God for that.

415
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Thank God for that.

416
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,760
You have the perfect formula.

417
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,420
I would buy just like a new Pokemon game of the exact same formula as like Heart, Gold,

418
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
and Soul Silver, basically till the end of time.

419
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,660
If you just give me new thing of the same style, because it's a fucking winner, and I

420
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
love that game.

421
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm really...

422
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,420
Just the way I buy every Metroidvania I can find, and I play them, because I just love

423
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
the game.

424
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm really curious as to how this curse can end.

425
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
People...

426
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,980
There have been alternative games that have come up and tried to be Pokemon that do the

427
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,420
things that the fans are looking for, or whatever, better gameplay and not shit and good and

428
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
stuff.

429
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Pokemon's a monopoly.

430
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
We need to break it up.

431
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,920
Because it is not the designs that people have grown up with, and grown old with at this

432
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
point.

433
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,360
They just never get off the ground.

434
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,920
They never grab people's hearts and attentions.

435
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,920
It's like, how are we going to stop giving the Pokemon company money?

436
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Gabe, I've got it.

437
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I've got the solution.

438
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,220
The designs are kind of bad, though.

439
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Have you guys seen fucking Mr. Mines Evolution?

440
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Mr. Rhyme?

441
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,920
What the fuck is Mr. Rhyme?

442
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Buster.

443
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Okay, but I have the solution.

444
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,280
I have the solution to this, and here's what it is.

445
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,600
It's that we pull a Teddy Roosevelt, and we bust this fucking trust, and what that means

446
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
is...

447
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,480
In the old days, there was Pokemon Red and Blue, right?

448
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,320
We're going to split the fucking games along company lines.

449
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,400
Certainly half the Pokemon Game Freed gets to keep.

450
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,480
Half the fucking Pokemon you put in a separate company makes a competing Pokemon game, but

451
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,600
you can trade between the two.

452
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,040
And with this new system, we'll get two different games, and it's going to be the competing

453
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,480
gameplay development styles that each game does.

454
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,520
But you can trade between the two, and this is how we make actual competition.

455
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,000
We could do more than two companies.

456
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
We could make each Pokemon have its own game.

457
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
We got enough Pokemon.

458
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,600
It makes sense to me.

459
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,440
This is... do that, Game Freak.

460
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Sell half Pokemon or something.

461
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,440
We just got to release Pokemon a Lightning Edition with all the Soniches in it.

462
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
That's it.

463
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
That's the solution.

464
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
Well, that's just going to top the charts.

465
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
It's not even a fair competition.

466
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,280
Oh boy, I sure do hate Pokemon.

467
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm going to play it.

468
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm kind of interested to see if they've learned any lessons from the last one, or if things

469
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
have gotten worse.

470
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm very invested in that.

471
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
I'm not.

472
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
So I'm real curious.

473
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,800
Everything I've seen that's new in this game looks bad.

474
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,960
You can change their natures now.

475
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I like that.

476
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
That's nice.

477
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
That's a plus.

478
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,040
Forcibly time-warping their backstories.

479
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,560
You would never shy.

480
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Yeah.

481
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,480
I mean, that's kind of a negative thing, because now we're just saying that we're making it

482
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,280
more gamey and less personality-y, and there's some trade-off.

483
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,880
People do like the gamey-gamey shit.

484
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,440
Have you seen the 7-hour Omega Ruby review?

485
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,160
A couple times I've started, and I've gotten 20 minutes, and I've been like, I'll definitely

486
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
get back to this.

487
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,080
I know what you're saying about how it's gamey-er, but he makes a pretty good argument towards

488
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,320
the end that, okay, it's cute, and everything that, once you catch a Pokemon, you're stuck

489
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
with it.

490
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:46,080
But the practical effect of not being able to change anything is basically just, like,

491
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,760
if you want a particular nature, you can get it.

492
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,080
It just takes you 14 hours or whatever.

493
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Yeah, it's not good.

494
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
But what if you want it on a shiny?

495
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,120
Well, that's going to take you forever.

496
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Infinite time.

497
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Yeah.

498
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,640
I think the implication of the game is that you're not supposed to grind until you have

499
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,720
the right nature.

500
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
You have to just work with what you find.

501
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,360
People like min-maxing, so they will play the game for 14 hours to get the right thing.

502
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,200
I feel like the game as it exists now could exist parallel along something like Pokemon

503
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,360
Showdown.

504
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,640
And I'm perfectly comfortable for all competitive Pokemon to be played on Pokemon Showdown

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
or something like that.

506
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
To me, I don't know.

507
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
If you...

508
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Okay, something like...

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm sure that changing your natures is a post-game thing that's not available right away.

510
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,760
You probably have to grind for it at some kind of battle arena.

511
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Items.

512
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Items.

513
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

514
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
I just don't know how you get those items.

515
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
It's probably...

516
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Probably post-game.

517
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,680
There was the thing that you could change a Pokemon's ability.

518
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,240
You could switch between if a Pokemon had two different abilities.

519
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,160
And to do that, you needed an item, and you had to earn that item in the battle arena.

520
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,640
So it's probably something like that.

521
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
It's not going to be something that just any casual can do.

522
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
It's still going to be something that only hardcore players would care about.

523
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
I think it's probably good.

524
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,200
I think it's probably good for more options like that.

525
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,160
I'm just wondering the fact that it's going to be the hardcore players doing it.

526
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,240
It's hard to object that much, but at the same time, canonically, it's like we're changing

527
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,520
Pokemon's personalities, which is supposed to have...

528
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
It's already fucked up.

529
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
I mean, it's a little fucked up.

530
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
It's already fucked up.

531
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Kind of.

532
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I guess that's true.

533
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
I mean, like all you do, I think you give it a mint.

534
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,520
I think that that's the item, and it's a specific kind of mint.

535
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,560
So you're just giving them a treat, and that affects them.

536
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,920
It's such an impact in their life.

537
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
I won't, sir.

538
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I won't.

539
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,120
Well, we shall see.

540
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
We shall see.

541
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Let us know, folks.

542
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
What do you think of New Pokemon?

543
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
I'm honestly excited.

544
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,640
I'm probably in the very vast minority of this, but...

545
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,920
I wonder if there's going to be a new Pokemon for Smash for this game.

546
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Definitely.

547
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,360
I want you to see Ice Q's true form.

548
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Okay.

549
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
This is like a larger version of what's in that.

550
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,040
I was thinking it looked like a fucking Internet mascot thing or an Android device.

551
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay.

552
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,360
Ignore the stuff on the left, but the two on the right, these are the images from the

553
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
leak.

554
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
They are.

555
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
They are.

556
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Yeah, that's right.

557
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Incredible.

558
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
It's a nightmare.

559
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
I hate it.

560
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
I know.

561
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
It's really bad.

562
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's really bad.

563
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,320
Look, I feel like this is on a new level from Klefki.

564
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Everyone complained about Klefki.

565
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Fuck off.

566
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
It's fine.

567
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I like it.

568
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's cute.

569
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Yeah.

570
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
But everyone hated it, and everyone hates Garbador, and everyone hates Vanillux.

571
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
It's cute.

572
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,160
And I just feel like compared to this, those don't even bear mentioning in terms of bad

573
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Pokemon.

574
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah.

575
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,980
It's like, I guess the idea, like concept behind this, is a penguin fell into the ice

576
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,080
and got frozen head and different kind of head based on what's something, but like...

577
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
That doesn't make this Pokemon.

578
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
It doesn't make it an animal in pain.

579
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,640
It's like the ice doesn't have any relation to the rest of the body, even in color.

580
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,240
It's just a fucking penguin.

581
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
It's shit.

582
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
It's real shit.

583
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
It's not great.

584
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,840
I think it might be related to the melting ice caps, environmental message and stuff,

585
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
because...

586
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Disgusting.

587
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Because it doesn't justify...

588
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,080
Keep politics out of my video game, goddammit.

589
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,800
You could have done a fucking better job with that concept.

590
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
No, okay.

591
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I got it.

592
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I got it.

593
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,200
It's a new form of Avalog, and it's ice water, and it's just sort of drooping, and it looks

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
like it's had a stroke, and it's like in constant pain.

595
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
That makes sense.

596
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,960
All you need is a fucking emaciated Polar Bear Pokemon to show like, oh, it's bad.

597
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
We already have one.

598
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
Okay, an entire line of Pokemon just based on the melting ice caps.

599
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,360
You have horrifying melting Avalog.

600
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,320
You have emaciated, like losing its fur, mangy fucking, oh, what's the Polar Bear?

601
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,480
The big Cub Chew evolves into...

602
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
It's like Volar Bears.

603
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,360
No, that's the fucking League of Legends character.

604
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Okay, you know the one I'm talking about.

605
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
I know it's done.

606
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,200
I think we literally made a better ice Pokemon in like an old procust, the freezer one,

607
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
right?

608
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Yeah.

609
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
The cooler, the ice steel type.

610
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Yeah.

611
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
The refrigerator.

612
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,040
Don't we already have one of those with what's-his-face Rotom, the refrigerator version of some

613
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
30-dice?

614
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Yeah, but ours was cooler.

615
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Okay, all right.

616
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Fair enough.

617
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Ice Rotom is electric.

618
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Wait, what form?

619
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Fridge form.

620
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
He's an electric ice.

621
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,640
It started as a cooler, it evolved into a fridge, and then it became a fucking iceberg.

623
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,040
It just went from human size to continent size.

624
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Sick.

625
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,800
Now, okay, so just despite all our misgivings about Pokemon and whatnot, now that's all

626
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,160
true, it's dead boys, but the spirit of Pokemon lives on.

627
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,760
The real Pokemon game is over on PCP Minecraft server, patreon.com, PCP Minecraft.

628
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
It is the greatest place.

629
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,920
You can ride your Pokemon, you can sail through the sky, and it's literally where Pokemon

630
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
lives on.

631
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,720
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're listening to this on Friday, then tomorrow, Saturday,

632
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,920
we will be streaming, right?

633
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,160
No, no, no.

634
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
We're streaming before that.

635
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,400
That's when we're recording the bonus episode, which is unrelated.

636
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
But when are we streaming?

637
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,160
Like on Tuesday, a few days before this goes out.

638
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,040
Okay, we shouldn't discuss this on the show, but that's not what you said.

639
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,480
And the bonus episode, Claude, that is what he said.

640
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,040
We will read back the transcript, and that will be vindicated.

641
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,400
Okay, well never mind, ignore everything I just said.

642
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
You will have seen a stream and come play with us on the stream, and there will be

643
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,480
more to come, so, you know, get involved if you want.

644
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,880
I'm fine, I'm fine with this, because that's not what you fucking said.

645
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,280
Okay, fine, and Mage actually is looking forward, or is in the planning stages of a Pokemon

646
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,680
tournament on the server, so we're gearing up for that at some point in the future.

647
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
I need to work out some details.

648
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,400
I worked out the prizes, thankfully, so...

649
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
What are the prizes?

650
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
I'm immediately curious.

651
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,960
Okay, because people were a little bit wary about getting like OP Pokemon or something

652
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,920
that has prizes, the elected that maybe I should look into giving away like statues

653
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,480
of Pokemon, which could be doable, I just wasn't sure if I could do it on the server.

654
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,120
And with a little bit of fiddling and stuff, and googling things, I managed to find out

655
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,640
away how to do it, so yeah, I'll be giving prizes like statues of certain Pokemon.

656
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
You get to choose which Pokemon or something?

657
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Well, I mean, for each...

658
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,560
You should have your team of Pokemon erected as statues, and put, oh, wouldn't that be

659
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
amazing for all time?

660
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm sick.

661
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,480
Well, if we're going to do this monthly, which people have been actually asking to do it

662
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,920
like bi-weekly, but I said I couldn't be able to do it, yeah, so monthly, so no, I think

663
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,080
like each tournament or so will have its own Pokemon as a sort of like the theme mascot

664
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
or something.

665
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Okay.

666
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,000
And that Pokemon will be the statue that you receive.

667
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That is a...

668
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,120
We have like a pedestal where that Pokemon stands, and then next month it gets traded

669
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,640
out with the next person's winning in like a plaque or something.

670
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,120
I mean, that would be a great idea.

671
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,200
The thing is though, with the statues, they're not the kind of items you can put in your inventory,

672
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,320
so I'd have to place it somewhere in their claim, and they won't be able to move it.

673
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I was wrong.

674
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
You said Monday.

675
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Hey, there you go.

676
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm the genius.

677
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I did it.

678
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,480
So it's Monday now, Tuesday?

679
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,040
We are doing the stream on Monday.

680
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
That's correct.

681
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh, okay.

682
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Yes.

683
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,540
And this will be long past for all you people.

684
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
No, it'll be on Monday.

685
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
We'll do more in the future.

686
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Wait, no.

687
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
No, it will be here.

688
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
We'll have happened on Monday.

689
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Whoops.

690
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Okay.

691
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
Fuck it.

692
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
All right.

693
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Now, Pokemon talk.

694
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
No, never enough Pokemon.

695
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,560
Let's discuss other things in our lives.

696
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Who's got some?

697
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
What else?

698
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
What else is there in our lives that there's in Pokemon?

699
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:53,960
Well, there's Slime and Punishment, which continues apace, developments are occurring,

700
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,800
Chris is tampering in the continuity some more.

701
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:06,000
My goal now, I will never compromise my artistic vision, but part of that artistic vision,

702
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
part of something that I find adds value to it, at least for me personally, the more of

703
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,520
Chris's lore that I can incorporate into it, the better.

704
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,720
So I'm eager when Chris does things or says things or says such and such about it, I'm

705
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,160
eager to be like, hmm, how can I work this in?

706
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Because it's funny.

707
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,000
But he's making that complicated for, I mean, she is making this challenging for you, as

708
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I recall.

709
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,680
I have mulled it over, she made a, yes, she made a, she drew another card showing Chris

710
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Chan Sonichu retrieving Phantom Horn from the Time Void.

711
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,880
And I was distressed by this, because it, well, it wasn't what I had planned.

712
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,320
And also, because I, like, it was, I think she thought the comic was over, I think she

713
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,920
thought that was the end.

714
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,800
Like that was where that was the end of Phantom Horn's fate, which is so ridiculous.

715
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,760
You should have said to be continued.

716
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,160
I guess I should, I guess I should have not assumed that it wasn't obvious, that was obvious

717
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,560
that there was going to be another update.

718
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,440
Like, why would I even, why would I even show that version of Phantom with the Podron Horn

719
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,840
if that was going to be what ended, he would, if he just had no relevance to anything and

720
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
he just ended up drifting.

721
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Because it's dark, dude.

722
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,000
I, you know, I guess, you know, I guess maybe, but no.

723
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But it's fine.

724
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,760
I've mulled it over and I think I can work with what Chris made actually just this morning,

725
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,040
this morning before the show, before this recording, I cranked out another four panels

726
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,400
and posted them incorporating my redrawn version of that card.

727
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,600
And we'll, we'll, you know, maybe later today, there'll be more developments.

728
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Excellent.

729
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah.

730
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,880
By the way, people do your favor.

731
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,920
And also, I guess I might as well mention this, Chris did suggest that she might show

732
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,280
up to my stream tonight, as in tonight when we're recording this, which would be really

733
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:04,240
fun and really funny and cool, but who knows if it'll actually happen, but she said it,

734
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
so I'm hopeful.

735
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,520
Does she mean like in the call or just in the chat?

736
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,840
She said she would be on Twitch.

737
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,880
So I mean, make of that, which you will.

738
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,440
You gotta make sure to add her when you post it your live, last ditch attempts to pull

739
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
them in.

740
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Yeah.

741
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Very true.

742
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Very true.

743
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I probably will.

744
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,880
But I think you'll find yourself swallowed whole, Ben, all by the sheer power, much like

745
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,520
if you go to the gross disgusting audio links where I just posted the picture I was looking

746
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,320
for of Gengar with this giant gaping mouthful.

747
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Oh my God.

748
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Isn't it glorious?

749
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
Now, that's what I'm talking about with Jaycanta Max.

750
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I'm way into that.

751
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Okay.

752
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
I can get excited about that.

753
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Mega Gengar is like a little...

754
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
His little hands.

755
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Look at his little hands.

756
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Yeah, it is.

757
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
He's going yes.

758
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Yeah.

759
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
It is.

760
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,640
It's Mega Gengar, but just like with his mouth really wide open.

761
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
No, it's not Mega Gengar.

762
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Mega Gengar has three eyes.

763
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Oh, that's...

764
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Yeah, that's true.

765
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
And he's not.

766
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,640
It's just because he has those Mega Gengar Liggies, that's why I assumed.

767
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
No.

768
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Okay.

769
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
No.

770
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
I mean, maybe this is...

771
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,640
No, this is just regular Gengar hands sticking up out of the ground going, boo.

772
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Oh, okay.

773
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm sorry.

774
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,080
But while we're on this, just look at this other art I found.

775
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,800
This would also have been a dope-ass Mega Gengar, but this is not real.

776
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
That's cute.

777
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
It's pretty cool.

778
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Yeah, I saw that one.

779
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,440
I can Google things too.

780
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
All right.

781
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Good work.

782
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Okay.

783
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Enough of that.

784
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Enough of that.

785
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Yes.

786
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
We did it.

787
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,600
I was just going to say, I'm putting fucking slime and punishment up on Topastic and Webtoon.

788
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,040
I would really like for it to get followers and especially likes on Webtoon, and it's

789
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,480
very hard and I hate it.

790
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,000
It's got like 40 followers, which is like nothing, and I'm depressed.

791
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's pretty low.

792
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,760
What I'm going to do is say like when you update from Twitter, just say go over to Thing

793
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,200
to read it, and then they'll have to go in.

794
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Yeah.

795
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
But a lot of people just don't do that.

796
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
A lot of people wouldn't do that.

797
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
You've got to force them to do that.

798
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Otherwise, they just won't.

799
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
They just won't follow you.

800
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I would do that.

801
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I would do that.

802
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
But in particular, the thing about that is that Chris would never see it.

803
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

804
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,480
Chris would never see it if I weren't posting it on Twitter.

805
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,600
What if you just post a preview of the page without the whole page and just like if you

806
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,720
want to know what actually happened, go to this page.

807
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,680
You can expect only a bare minimum of effort from Chris, I think, and other people might

808
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
work.

809
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,200
I mean, you could do like a, you know, it's live now for people who are following and

810
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,120
then, you know, three, four hours later, you post it on Twitter for Chris, just so it's

811
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,440
all there on Twitter as well.

812
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,160
Even though I have been doing more and better work than I have ever done in my entire life,

813
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,240
for months now, my Patreon has stagnated and in fact only gone down a bit.

814
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,440
So that's cool.

815
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,560
That's good.

816
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Life's gone great for me.

817
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I feel that, dude.

818
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,480
I feel that hardcore the worst.

819
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
But you know what?

820
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
I don't care.

821
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm going to do it anyway.

822
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,680
I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing my thing.

823
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
And that's it.

824
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
There and out.

825
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
That's what I've been thinking.

826
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
That's what it's about.

827
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,180
That's how it's done.

828
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,640
In terms of like public things, I've been doing really nothing, but I've been working

829
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,640
very hard on comic things in the background.

830
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,200
Uh, yeah, I have, I have a vaporette to draw now.

831
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,600
I have read no art to finish.

832
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,960
I have a whole thing, uh, I won't say.

833
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,680
But then after that, after all that, I've gotten more comics and more things and more

834
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,520
scripts and writing and it's like, ooh, I wish, I wish I was like, um, posting stuff

835
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:53,960
regularly and being like, you know, keeping up with, uh, stuff and, and, uh, engagement

836
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
or whatever the fuck it is.

837
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Mm-hmm.

838
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,200
Engagement is good.

839
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,600
You would, which you can find plenty of over on me and Digi's new channel kind of intent

840
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,280
with, with, you know, I was thinking, if I put up a green screen, would you throw me

841
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,760
into an episode?

842
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,600
Oh, we, we made this specifically with the hope that we could involve you guys in various

843
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
projects that would be of note to you.

844
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,120
For example, Tom, uh, talking about Beastars is already intended to be done at some point.

845
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Uh, I didn't see your video about it, but I wanted to because I like Beastars.

846
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
It's worth it.

847
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
It's worth it.

848
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Beastars is fucking sick.

849
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah.

850
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Tom will tell you all day.

851
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Oh, I'm glad.

852
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm glad.

853
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,040
Shout out to May for dropping into my DMs like two weeks ago.

854
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,320
I was like, can you to watch Beastars?

855
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
Main character is you.

856
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
And the first episode you was like.

857
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Oh, she told you to watch, huh?

858
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
She, she did.

859
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,000
She was the one who turned me on to it and then I became addicted.

860
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,720
She's the one who turns you on to it and then you got turned on all by yourself.

861
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Yeah.

862
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
The rest is all me, baby.

863
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
Are you, I'm interested.

864
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,480
Now I'm kind of curious because I've seen some of the show.

865
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,040
How do you relate to Lugosi?

866
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,560
Do you, I mean, you are a very tall boy.

867
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Similar to Lugosi.

868
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Uh, I don't know.

869
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,440
I didn't, uh, uh, uh, just, I asked May like what, how I was the main character because

870
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,560
the two main characters are just like sad, not socially functioning people.

871
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Kinda.

872
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
And I was like, I guess that's true.

873
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I guess that makes sense.

874
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,440
And that was just like, he's like tall and awkward and has like moments of rage.

875
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm like, yeah, that's about right.

876
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
I guess so.

877
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,420
He doesn't, and it kind of looks like you a little bit.

878
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
I guess so.

879
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,680
This is a tall thin thing, I guess, but, um, I'm okay being compared to Lugosi, especially

880
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,240
as his arc continues throughout the manga and becomes fucking sick.

881
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,280
Does he ever go beast mode and unlock his superpowers and, you know, I will not spoil

882
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,640
anything, but if you think that this show is what it appears to be, you are so mistaken.

883
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
It's not even fine.

884
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,720
People have been saying that it's, I thought it was just a high school drama.

885
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
People are like, no, no, no, no.

886
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
And I'm like, okay.

887
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
All right.

888
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Fair enough.

889
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,240
I've been watching it and I, and I keep thinking just like, I still don't have a feel on this

890
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
show.

891
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,400
It just, I don't know what it, what I'm supposed to feel about it.

892
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Like, what is this?

893
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
What is this show?

894
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
I don't know.

895
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,640
You know, cause I was so just thinking just, oh, like it's literally just a J drama, but

896
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,320
with animal boys, but I, and it's hard for me to imagine how it's going to not do that.

897
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
But I guess it's going to.

898
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,600
Wait, haven't, didn't you do a calm turn?

899
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,720
On Beastars with Digi?

900
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,160
Well, yeah, but it was only four episodes long or three.

901
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,160
You couldn't get a feel for what it was about from four.

902
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Well, yeah.

903
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,120
What we're saying is what the feeling we got seemed very much like a J drama, but everyone

904
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,120
is saying, nah, nah, nah, you guys don't know what you're in for.

905
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Well, okay.

906
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Okay.

907
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Just like, okay.

908
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
The show is a drama.

909
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Like that is what it is about.

910
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,400
It's just that the scope and the stakes and the scale expand far beyond what it initially

911
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
seems to present.

912
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Sure.

913
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh, so it's like Homestuck.

914
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
I wouldn't know.

915
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Shut up.

916
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
So it's like, it's like, it's like Dogstock.

917
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
It's like Catstock.

918
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,520
I mean, Homestuck from the very beginning was about, at the very least, all of Earth

919
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,000
in jeopardy of, yeah, I mean, it was destroyed or, kind of, kind of.

920
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
It escalates real quick.

921
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
It got to like multiversal stuff though, so fair enough, I guess.

922
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,200
Act One is like a boy in his room, fucking around, and then at the end of Act One, there's

923
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,920
a meteor coming to kill him, and from there it escalates.

924
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,320
All right, Gib, riddle me this.

925
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,880
Who would win in a fight, Homestuck or Gurren Lagan?

926
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,400
Who wins that fight?

927
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,480
In terms of like the characters and their power levels fighting each other, or like...

928
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,680
You know, we already thought too much about it, never mind.

929
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:32,760
No, I think Homestuck would win, because of Kaliope, of dead Kaliope making the big black

930
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,760
hole that would suck up a giant, universe-sized camera.

931
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Well, here's your problem, Gib.

932
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Kaliope is a weak...

933
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
She's destroyed.

934
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Could never defeat the masculine energy of God-community-spirited.

935
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,280
Nah, she'd suck him right up.

936
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,960
She'd suck him right down into that black hole, if you know what I'm saying.

937
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
She'd probably give him...

938
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,000
I was gonna say she'll give him a Me Too moment, he'll never forget, but I just hope to be

939
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
a part of it.

940
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
All right.

941
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What are we talking about?

942
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I can't remember.

943
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't know.

944
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We got here.

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Obie Stars.

946
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,640
We subscribed to Can-Tent to watch our fan page.

947
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Recently.

948
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
We subscribed to Can-Tent.

949
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh, but Gib, you were saying if you could be on a green screen, yes, and I'm curious

950
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,000
if there's anything that you are interested in.

951
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,560
Well, I don't know whether I'm interested in discussing anything, but I have recently...

952
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,920
My brother bought like five green screen sheets a while ago, but he's never had a use for

953
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,560
them, and we were clearing out his room, and he gave them to me, and now I have enough

954
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,880
green screen to green screen an entire room from all around me, and I was just thinking

955
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
of...

956
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Nice.

957
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,520
Green screen is like the progenitor of creativity.

958
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,880
If I have a big green screen, and I'm thinking, I want to make a video now, I'm just going

959
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,000
to sit here with a microphone in my hand in a void of green and talk about nothing in

960
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,520
particular, and I want to film it.

961
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,960
You know who does this good work with that formula?

962
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,840
Green screen power, and yet here we are, a whole room at your disposal.

963
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Indeed.

964
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Truly terrible.

965
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,500
Nakey Jakey, with his writing and stuff, people like him a lot, but he generally sits

966
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,840
on a bouncy ball in a green screen, and then edits himself moving around.

967
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah, it's a good thing.

968
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,920
I like his style with that shit.

969
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:17,120
I probably do a combination of that top-down green screen thing, but also the stupid...

970
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:23,160
If you remember all of the green screen videos I've made, I forget the names of them, but

971
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,240
there's all give and take videos where I'm just holding a green thing, and I'm fucking

972
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,480
around and saying stuff to the camera, and it's just fun.

973
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,680
It's just fun keying things.

974
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,560
The spirit was continued into a GRPJ to increase that.

975
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,440
GRPJ throwing the final fantasy, I just threw the green screen in the background, and that's

976
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,040
the green screen, that's the game footage.

977
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
It's really fun.

978
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
It's good.

979
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:53,240
And then obviously the huge universe-shattering video, GRPJ Super Mario RPG, where it's just

980
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
my floating head.

981
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,520
Right.

982
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,800
Some people, maybe you guys, I don't know if you saw this or anything, but on some of

983
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,560
the content videos that Digi and I have done, the initial ones were in person with a green

984
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,080
screen, but in the later ones, the whole premise is we green screen ourselves separately so

985
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,800
we can kind of add them together.

986
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,040
Digi's video quality is so much better than mine, and yet you still have people being

987
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,360
like, or rather on one video, where we actually were together, that was released after this,

988
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,240
where we were like, man, this one's weird, because it's weird to see Digi and Nate pretending

989
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,080
to be in the same room together, because now I know they're not, but no, we actually

990
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,960
were in the same room in that video.

991
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,680
Look at the fucking film.

992
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
It's amusing to see.

993
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
So people are fooled.

994
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,960
People are convinced by the rudimentary trickery of the style, so low bar to cross for all

995
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,040
that stuff, I guess.

996
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,600
Ooh, and I'm happy to report, folks, we have crossed the threshold where we now are applying

997
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,080
for monetization on content, and the pennies are just going to roll in, baby.

998
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Very excited.

999
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,720
Speaking of monetization on content, so I had trouble when I was uploading the Ben

1000
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:14,480
Saint vs. Digi Bro stream, it kept, man, I was so careful with it, I would go in and

1001
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,200
I would change the title, and I would change the thumbnail, and I would change the description

1002
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,320
and the tags and stuff, and I would like, and sometimes, and it kept tagging it as unfit

1003
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,880
for monetization, limited monetization, and I uploaded it, and I re-uploaded it a bunch

1004
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,880
of times, and I finally got it, I finally got it, so that it was not flagged for that,

1005
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,880
and then I released it, and then immediately it gets flagged, and this happened twice,

1006
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,200
this happened twice, but, you know, I actually, I, okay, it sucks, because, you know, it's

1007
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,400
already got a couple thousand views, and those were not monetized, but I applied for review,

1008
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,560
and they approved it, so it is monetized now, like I wanted it to be, so I guess that's

1009
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
a win.

1010
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,520
You know, I don't know if people are aware of this, but public service announcement,

1011
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,560
like just for example, the PCP, now the PCP does not always get monetized, but, or rather,

1012
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,440
it'll get like the yellow lower monetization thing or whatever, which just means it doesn't

1013
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
run ads, right?

1014
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Which basically just means it doesn't run ads, right?

1015
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,960
Or it doesn't make money from ads?

1016
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,520
It gets like the very lowest bottom tier ads, or none at all, I think, is, I think that's

1017
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
the idea.

1018
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,160
So, so when I upload the, right now, we try to get the episodes done by Wednesday, because

1019
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,600
the episode needs to go up Friday, and the reason we give it a big window is specifically

1020
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,560
so we have like a full day at least, to, we upload it, it will basically always get limited

1021
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,040
monetization, we appeal it, and then most of the time, in that day or two, it will get

1022
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,480
like, you know, manually reviewed, and then it'll be monetized.

1023
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,360
So like, we have to build in like a day or two of waiting period for this shit, for the

1024
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,400
whole system, which I do on my channel too, and I don't know, you guys probably do on

1025
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,440
yours, it's a big fucking pain, but now that just seems to be what you gotta do to make

1026
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,440
sure you get, you know, all the full money you're trying to get from it.

1027
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,840
It doesn't even guarantee it, because you can always get re-hit later.

1028
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,400
That's, yeah, I mean, it's always true.

1029
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,120
And I guess I will double this by saying, use this opportunity to say, go to my channel,

1030
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,000
watch me debate Digi about Yang and Bernie and stuff.

1031
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,360
Did I tell you that video got 1,000 views on the VOD on Twitch, which is like, ridiculous

1032
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,440
for Twitch, to get 1,000 views on one VOD.

1033
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,240
Like 20 views on a VOD is like, wow, this is really, really popping off.

1034
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
That's pretty normal.

1035
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,680
Maybe 50 for like a real humdinger.

1036
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Yeah, yeah.

1037
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,180
I don't know.

1038
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,000
Nobody watches anything on Twitch, because I can't watch VODs as much.

1039
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's terrible.

1040
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,360
The player is terrible on Twitch, so I don't blame them.

1041
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,320
You have all that live content right at your fingertips.

1042
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,600
I'm not going to watch something from a while ago.

1043
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
That's bullshit.

1044
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Make some sense.

1045
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Make some sense.

1046
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,040
There was one time when I went on to like an RFCK stream, and I didn't realize that

1047
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,440
what was playing was an old stream that I hadn't seen before.

1048
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,920
And the chat was rolling, and I was talking to people as if they could hear me.

1049
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,600
You can type in the chat while it's like past history chat.

1050
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Yeah.

1051
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Nobody responds, because you weren't there.

1052
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,640
And I was like, what the fuck?

1053
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I'm getting flamed by everyone.

1054
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,360
When was an old stream playing on RFCK?

1055
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,560
No, it's just the thing that happens.

1056
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,520
If you go to a streaming channel when they're not currently streaming, it will like maybe

1057
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,080
auto-play like the last thing that was like saved.

1058
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,080
I have never seen it do that, but perhaps it's true.

1059
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,880
I mean, maybe I clicked on it, I can't remember, but like either way, I was really annoyed

1060
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,320
at everyone, and then I paused it.

1061
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:46,040
I paused the stream and realized that the chat stopped as well, and I felt stupid.

1062
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,680
I just wanted a response of some kind.

1063
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,200
I was thinking of going to Discord, and I was like, wait a minute, they're talking about

1064
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
old shit.

1065
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Oh no.

1066
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Weird.

1067
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Yep.

1068
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Yep.

1069
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
How very dehumanizing.

1070
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:07,120
You're making like real solid posts, you're like having a real good time with your friends,

1071
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,280
and like hours later you suddenly realize, wait a minute, it's fake.

1072
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
Nothing was real.

1073
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,640
Like I don't know why they allow you to chat unless like VODs can have-

1074
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
That's strange.

1075
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
It's like-

1076
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,880
Why would you want to?

1077
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,040
I think potentially it's like if multiple people watch the video back and they add their

1078
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,920
chat in the moment, then it shows up if somebody watches it again.

1079
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,920
So like you can continually add to the chat, it's just the chat is no longer talking to

1080
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,840
each other, really.

1081
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,120
You're just going in and adding your thoughts or something.

1082
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Yeah.

1083
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Very weird.

1084
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,120
You're changing the stream.

1085
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,720
So for other people who watch it back later could see it, I guess, I don't know.

1086
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,560
I don't know if it displays separately, because you can do this on YouTube too, if you like

1087
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,080
watch back live streams, I mean at least you can see the chat going.

1088
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,280
I'm not totally sure if you can comment or not on those.

1089
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
I don't think so.

1090
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
I'm not sure, honestly.

1091
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Yeah.

1092
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
I don't think so.

1093
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
I'm not sure, honestly.

1094
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Imagine if you made the mistake of sending a super chat of an old stream.

1095
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,000
They didn't even say your name on stream.

1096
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,560
Somebody did cheer me while I was sleeping on stream.

1097
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,760
Okay, but that was a live stream.

1098
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,080
Yeah, it was technically live, even though I was dead.

1099
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:27,880
You were probably saying, Ben, we're reaching out to you from the real world.

1100
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,880
You've been unconscious for 50 years.

1101
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,600
We're trying to wake you up, but oh, but you've missed out too bad.

1102
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,160
How did you fall asleep on a stream?

1103
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
Did you, what happened?

1104
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
Did I not talk about that?

1105
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Maybe you weren't here.

1106
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
I did talk about it.

1107
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
You got drunk.

1108
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,520
I just accidentally, yeah, I got really drunk.

1109
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,520
I ended the stream.

1110
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,200
I accidentally restarted it.

1111
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,920
I have no idea how, but I did.

1112
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:58,480
Then I went to bed and slept for like six hours in a pitch dark room, and that's what

1113
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
happened.

1114
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
You should upload that to YouTube.

1115
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
You got a lot of watch time on that.

1116
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,840
No, I deleted it because I was embarrassed.

1117
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
I don't blame you.

1118
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,840
What did the camera show, just like an empty chair or something?

1119
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
No, it was just blank.

1120
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Because I turned the lights off.

1121
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,880
Did the people hear you snore in the background?

1122
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
I don't know.

1123
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
I mean.

1124
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
No, no, no.

1125
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Now it's gone.

1126
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
It's been banned.

1127
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,240
Some devious man has like a bank now of Ben snore clips.

1128
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,760
No, don't even joke about that.

1129
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,520
I don't think I snore.

1130
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,840
No one's ever told me that I snore.

1131
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
At least not regularly.

1132
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Yeah, so you'll never know if you snore or not until people tell you.

1133
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,560
I mean, everybody does it sometimes.

1134
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,600
People are going to start like, here's some proof.

1135
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,200
Like a black video and then just a snore sound effect.

1136
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
This is Ben.

1137
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Oh yeah, you just play that.

1138
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
Proof.

1139
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,520
So that's what's up.

1140
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,520
What else is on your mind, ladies and gentlemen?

1141
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,920
Well, speaking about that YouTube stuff, what was that the p-score thing?

1142
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
I watched that video Tom mentioned.

1143
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
It was fucking weird, right?

1144
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:12,280
There was this thing, people, like a community of people, there was this video of this guy

1145
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,800
talking about it.

1146
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,760
Remember that there is a hidden p-score that you can find that is basically, I don't know

1147
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,520
how it's calculated, but it's definitely tampered with to inflate on YouTube, right?

1148
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
On YouTube.

1149
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,080
To inflate the importance or whatever.

1150
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,000
I forget what the p stands for, I think like profitability or something of that.

1151
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,720
There's like four or five different p's that they average, like you rank your channel on,

1152
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,440
then average them out to give you your p-score and that determines whether your ads are limited

1153
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,040
even if you have green monetization on them or not.

1154
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,360
Just as one example, you've seen Munchy rack up a significant p-store score on this very

1155
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,840
podcast on occasion.

1156
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
Yes.

1157
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:59,320
But like the gist of what they found was people with lower p-scores, they get a green monetization

1158
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,760
ding or whatever.

1159
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,880
They're not like yellow box demonetized, but the ads they get, the rates are lower than

1160
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:17,080
people with higher p-scores because their work is like dubbed less or more ad-friendly.

1161
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,800
Ad-friendly stuff that's still technically monetized, like the PCP, I'm sure, has lower

1162
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,760
ad rates than a baby cat channel or whatever that is completely safe and gets exactly the

1163
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,880
same amount of watch time.

1164
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,680
It would get more money.

1165
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:39,600
And they found this out through inspecting the metadata of the website.

1166
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,160
And that video was, I watched it a week after it was uploaded.

1167
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,000
By that time, it was completely gone.

1168
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,720
You couldn't actually do it anymore.

1169
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,160
The YouTube stuff were very quick to act and edit the code so that you couldn't see it.

1170
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,440
But they made a huge list of a bunch of notable YouTubers and their p-scores.

1171
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,240
And of course, the very, very, very top of the list where people like Stephen Colbert,

1172
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:14,240
the late show with some fuck, this, that, and the other news thing, the BBC news or whatever.

1173
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,320
All these big companies that are varying levels of watch time viewers, ship and subscribers,

1174
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,960
but they've all got perfect p-scores regardless of the content they post because YouTube wants

1175
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,960
to promote them and give them money so that they will stay on the site and bring viewership

1176
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,160
to the site, I guess.

1177
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,320
But it's shady, shady and shitty, and I don't like it.

1178
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,600
I mean, I get it, I get the reasoning, but it's just like, why'd you gotta be so sneaky

1179
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
about it?

1180
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,920
Obviously, we don't like it when we find out.

1181
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:53,320
You're gonna, when you're gonna learn that, like, they talk so, they talk such a big game

1182
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,560
about like, we're gonna be transparent with you.

1183
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,040
That was all in 2018.

1184
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,800
Such transparency, Susan Wojcicki was going all over the place saying, we're gonna be

1185
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,880
so straight with you, and then we find out this, and it's like, okay, sure.

1186
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,920
I'm like, you're not even surprised, you're just disappointed, you're just like, of course.

1187
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Yeah?

1188
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,520
Well, let me play Hitler's Advocate for a moment, as I like to do.

1189
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Your favorite game to play.

1190
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,480
I mean, every company is gonna have some things they don't share with everybody, and we know

1191
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,360
that there's these degrees of, oh, okay, like, a company has to decide, like, YouTube.

1192
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,720
Obviously, they're gonna have some algorithm for, at the very least, to determine, like,

1193
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,760
they've got ads, companies pay them to put their ads on videos, okay, they've now got

1194
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,560
to determine what goes where.

1195
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,960
Presumably, not everybody's paying the same amount, and I mean, there's multiple ways

1196
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,480
they could decide which ad goes in which place, or whatever the fuck.

1197
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,680
So they need some system, and I guess this is that system, in effect, anyway.

1198
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,280
I mean, the literal number is not really, like, nobody could find out how the number

1199
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:03,560
was calculated exactly, it was just the fact that channels, based on something, were determined

1200
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:12,560
to be teens, or for kids, you know, suitable for kids, or teens, or adults, or there was

1201
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:19,160
like a scale, and you were in a number of classes, the more risqué you were, the less

1202
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,600
money you would make.

1203
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,760
But you know, it's one thing to not have the information of what your channel is deemed

1204
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:36,120
as, like, but it's also very confusing, because some of the channels were like, that they

1205
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:44,120
looked into were like, they're seen as like teen channels, I forget the terminology, but

1206
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:52,840
like, suitable for teens, not for children, some swear words, this or that, but the content

1207
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,720
was not like overtly anything bad, it was actually quite safe.

1208
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,520
You have to be, like, strangely safe in order to get the super safe category.

1209
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,920
I see, I see.

1210
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,320
I mean, maybe you could link to the video, because it was pretty in-depth, and I liked

1211
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,320
the discussion.

1212
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,720
It was just sort of like, I don't know, I mean, I'm not in the YouTube game anymore,

1213
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,760
but this stuff still annoys me.

1214
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,000
It concerns me, I mean, at the very least, if you're on YouTube as I am, like, you really

1215
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,360
need to know these things, and watch, like, the Creator Insider videos that they release

1216
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,640
about like updates, and just be aware, because like, you know, it's their platform, and you're

1217
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,760
a guest, and you want to make sure you are aware if your efforts are being used in the

1218
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,320
best possible ways.

1219
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,800
But this reminded me of a couple other things I heard about this recently, like, I mean,

1220
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,320
for one, Filthy Frank's vomit cake got taken down, specific, like, there was a specific

1221
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,080
reason for why it was taken down, that I think, like, Bedhead Bernie noticed or something

1222
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,840
retweeted, and it was like, due to it being not in alignment with like, YouTube's values,

1223
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,760
or like, something like that, it's available online, maybe we'll see if I can find it later

1224
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
on.

1225
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
And then there was another thing.

1226
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,280
There was something about how, like, there's a, I don't know if this is manifested in any

1227
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,400
negative ways yet, but I heard some people, I think Sticks, Hex and Hammer talked about

1228
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,000
this, there's a new, there's a new, like, degree of determining if YouTube channels

1229
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,600
are like, wanted on YouTube at all, or possibly for monetization, it's not quite clear yet,

1230
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:32,240
but the criteria for this now is specifically commercial viability of YouTube, not of the

1231
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:38,160
channel, of YouTube, like, so seemingly the idea here appears to be that, will this channel

1232
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,840
being here be commercially viable for YouTube itself?

1233
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,320
Sounds like they're being a bit of a publisher right now, sounds like they're not being free

1234
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,160
speech boys, I mean, that's fine, make your choice, but you know, let's not have it both

1235
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
ways.

1236
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,200
But there's a lot of shit that comes with it that they're not proven to at this point.

1237
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,240
So I mean, I don't know, again, the full ramifications of that, I don't know yet, I just heard about

1238
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,440
that recently, but well, I mean, you know, we're just marching down the path of, I mean,

1239
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,120
again, it's fine, it's fine, be a publisher if you want to be, but it's just frustrating

1240
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,760
to try to have it both ways.

1241
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,360
Yeah, it's always been about like, they couldn't possibly explain that they are like, they

1242
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,960
have values, because then everybody who doesn't share those values will be upset, so they

1243
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,280
have to keep everything secret and just tweak things in the background, and it's like, everyone

1244
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,000
hates that, everyone dislike that, stop.

1245
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,440
Yeah, there it is.

1246
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,840
Well, just got to know that going into the game, baby, I'm aware, I'll keep that in

1247
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,760
mind as I make business decisions for myself involving YouTube going forward.

1248
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,680
Yeah, that's all there is, I guess.

1249
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh, fuck YouTube.

1250
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,080
Why'd you say fuck you to me?

1251
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,520
Because I want to get demonetized.

1252
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,400
Are you calling it a tube as well?

1253
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
How rude.

1254
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,920
Oh, guys, what's the point of it all, you know, what are we doing it for?

1255
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,240
Oh, you want to get a secret of NIMS, a reason to live?

1256
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,680
You want to know the meaning of life?

1257
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Right.

1258
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Please.

1259
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:17,240
Okay, here's the meaning of life, it's to play the new Pokemon.

1260
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:23,880
Oh, we're so starved for Pokemon, we need that to live.

1261
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:31,240
I can't wait until next week's episode where we'll talk about Pokemon again.

1262
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,880
We will discuss it to some degree, I'm sure.

1263
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,880
Why?

1264
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Oh, because the game will be out.

1265
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,880
It'll be out, it'll be out, you know, things to say.

1266
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,560
Like, yeah, it's good, like, huh, yeah, it's Pokemon.

1267
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,240
It's pretty good, I got a Pokemon, you know, I caught one, that's pretty good.

1268
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
I got Pokeballs.

1269
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Yeah, it's a hell of a life.

1270
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:55,920
It made me remember how I liked the other games, because it was the same, 10 out of

1271
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,920
10.

1272
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,360
It was able to distract me enough from playing this game to remember the old games that,

1273
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,560
you know, pretty positive experience overall.

1274
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,680
The meaning of life is stupid, like, as a question, so I don't care anymore about it.

1275
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,640
I'm just going to live, and I'll find out after I'm dead, I don't need to think about

1276
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,560
it at the moment, I'll figure it out later.

1277
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,480
In terms of philosophical discussion, you know, I was playing on stream, Twitch.tv

1278
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,680
slash definitely best guy ever.

1279
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,680
What was it?

1280
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,440
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, and there was an intellectual philosophical discussion

1281
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,200
between Monsoon and our boy, Raiden, and they were like, why do you kill Raiden?

1282
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,160
People, they don't choose their circumstances, why do you kill him?

1283
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,320
And he just said, I'm going to let her rip, baby, I'm just born to kill, and I kill to

1284
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,120
be born, basically an appeal to nature, which is a logical fallacy, if you ask me.

1285
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,840
But nonetheless, just do what feels good is basically the argument.

1286
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,120
Nade's trying to make his stream out to be like, it was like, you know, a deep philosophical

1287
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,480
conversation, but Nade over here is like the maestro of memes with the whole soundboard

1288
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,480
of like constant reaction sounds, oh wait, this conversation's going on, so I'd use them,

1289
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,800
but you guys wouldn't be able to hear it before recording them, too bad, too bad.

1290
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,480
I've thought about like having a soundboard, just so that I can have my own lexicon of

1291
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,120
funny sounds.

1292
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:22,920
My vocabulary has expanded a dozen fold based on this meme menagerie I have in my fingertips

1293
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
on my streams.

1294
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,600
Oh, I know how I deal with blobs, because my language would not be complete without

1295
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,240
including blobs every now and then.

1296
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,240
I have one of you, Mage, in mind as well, it's you going, she's such anormy, as famously

1297
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,400
everyone knows.

1298
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,960
It's a wonderful little clip.

1299
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,400
No, no.

1300
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,120
You know what, there was one classic Internet Nate boy, you know, the other day, Michelle

1301
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,960
got a call from her boss and the boss just said on the phone, I could hear it, because

1302
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,480
it was just loud, she just said the clip, you're a rockstar, just like that, and I wanted

1303
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,680
so bad, I mean, she was, because she like agreed to like take a shift or something,

1304
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,440
and just you're a rockstar, and I just wish I had that captured, because it was so fucking

1305
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
funny.

1306
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
What's that?

1307
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
Needlessly.

1308
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,400
I mean, it was her voice, she was saying, this is a human being, she was speaking to

1309
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,920
you on the phone, there was no recording, there was no...

1310
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,040
Oh, you wanted that to be a sound, I see.

1311
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,920
I wish I had captured that in some way, so I could make it a meme sound, because it was

1312
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,680
really funny.

1313
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,360
Maybe I'll use my own voice, saying it here on this very podcast.

1314
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,080
You've just got to have Odess seem like recording at all times.

1315
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,720
I wish I, if this was going to be like Michelle, okay, call her back and just ask, what am

1316
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
I again?

1317
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,680
Michelle, I'm going to need you to walk through that conversation one more time, and I'm going

1318
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,320
to be recording this time.

1319
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,600
That would be ideal, I wish I could do that.

1320
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,600
I wish I could do that.

1321
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,280
Oh well, that's life, baby.

1322
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,280
Fuck, yeah.

1323
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,920
I'm gamifying my whole life.

1324
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,520
We got any more shit to talk about, do you want to go to voicemails, is it too early

1325
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
for that?

1326
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,920
I'm curious, I'm curious if the quality of the voicemails improved since the last time

1327
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,920
we did.

1328
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
We had one last week, didn't we?

1329
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Just one.

1330
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
I can tell you one.

1331
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,920
Well, I can tell you we have six this time, so that's an improvement.

1332
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,360
Hang on, I'm wrecking my brain right now.

1333
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,920
I thought I had a topic right here, right here in my brain, in my noggin.

1334
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Is it coming?

1335
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
My topic is the tropics.

1336
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Is it here?

1337
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Is it going?

1338
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Is it going?

1339
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
That's gone.

1340
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,840
I mean, if you think of it, we can get back to, if you think of it, let's fucking talk

1341
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
about it.

1342
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,760
But all right, let's fucking go to the voicemails, and that'll take a good two, three hours to

1343
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,320
get through, so let's see how it goes.

1344
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,920
All right, let me see here.

1345
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Okay, first one.

1346
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,920
Oh, of course, everybody, speak pipe, link down below in the description, leave us your

1347
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
epic voicemails.

1348
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,720
Make some short and sweet, baby.

1349
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,120
Brevity is the soul of wit.

1350
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,560
I can tell you most voicemails that otherwise might have made it are just too long.

1351
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,920
They're just too fucking long, and they're not fun.

1352
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,680
A joke gets so much less funny when it stretched out over like a minute, as opposed to being

1353
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,080
20 seconds long.

1354
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,920
Keep that in mind, folks.

1355
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,920
That is the biggest determiner for me, if you get on or not.

1356
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Oh, wait, I remembered it.

1357
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,320
It was tangentially related to meaning of life.

1358
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:14,360
Meaning of life is to work hard and be cool, and I have, for the past month, two months,

1359
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:24,080
I actually remember, I have been strictly regimenting my online habits, my internet usage, my phone,

1360
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,520
and it has been really good.

1361
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:32,720
I've got that schedule, I've got that lifestyle, and I think I said a while ago I was going

1362
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,120
to do exercising.

1363
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:42,240
I've kept that up every other day, 20 minutes on the exercise bike, on the old leg thing.

1364
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,520
That's got to the point where it's not even a question.

1365
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,840
I just get up, if it's like, did I do it yesterday?

1366
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
No, I didn't.

1367
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,160
And then I go, and I do that, and I'm exercising, so that's one good thing.

1368
01:00:52,160 --> 01:01:01,200
Two good things is the cold turkey thing I have, so I've made it so that, because today

1369
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
is a weekend.

1370
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,600
It's a weekend as a free day, and I was planning to work a bit on the weekend.

1371
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,840
But of course, I was spending the entire time watching on cinema at the cinema and playing

1372
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:18,600
Kenchi all day, not doing the work I was going to do, but that's okay, because throughout

1373
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:26,680
the whole week, I have been like keeping with, like been unable to not fuck up my work schedule.

1374
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,680
I've been making great progress on my comic things.

1375
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,560
The other, yesterday, I drew like five pages, sketched five pages of the thing, and there's

1376
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,840
like, yeah, it's really good.

1377
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:51,280
And also going to bed, and waking up at the right time, and having a cup of joe, and uh...

1378
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,280
I got mine right here.

1379
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
Like a real boy.

1380
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,240
Yeah, I'm like a human being or something.

1381
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,200
I'm waking up early enough so that I get the early morning news and be like, ah yes, Brexit.

1382
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,200
Yes, that sucks.

1383
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Ah, the election.

1384
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
Yes, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson.

1385
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,880
Oh yeah, we're past Halloween.

1386
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,880
That didn't happen, did it?

1387
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
No, it didn't happen.

1388
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,200
There's an election going on now.

1389
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,600
Oh yeah, right, right.

1390
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,120
I could talk about the politics of that, but I don't think any of you know, maybe Mesh

1391
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,120
does a little bit.

1392
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,120
Who are you voting for, Gil?

1393
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,120
Are you voting Corbyn?

1394
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
Are you going for Corbyn?

1395
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,960
I'm going to wait until the manifesto is out, and I'm going to actually read it before

1396
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
I decide.

1397
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,640
Because Jeremy Corbyn, you know, he sounds pretty good compared to all the other candidates

1398
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,160
that are out at the moment.

1399
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,800
And in terms of like who could win, it's either Boris or Jeremy, most likely.

1400
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,880
And I'd rather Jeremy just on the face of it because the Tories are...

1401
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,920
There's lots of things that they do that I don't like.

1402
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:51,160
And it's generally like the other party of the rich in a very broad sense.

1403
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:56,600
They improve structural things in the, you know, they do things so that they can say

1404
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,600
that they're improving like schools and hospitals and stuff.

1405
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,640
But it's usually just like schools and hospitals in certain places that are already pretty

1406
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:11,760
good and that they're sort of like letting lower money areas sort of turn to dust and

1407
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,640
all the people die in the streets in a sense.

1408
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:21,040
And you know, they'll get around to that in a while, but you know, that's how it seems

1409
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
anyway.

1410
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,320
I've been keeping up with the news and it seems like that's the Tory idea.

1411
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:33,440
That's consistent with my impression of the Tory party and like Boris versus Jeremy.

1412
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,280
I have the feeling that Jeremy is the better of the two, but I don't have a lot of knowledge

1413
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,280
about it.

1414
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,280
Yeah.

1415
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,280
I mean, I don't know how good he's going to be at running the country.

1416
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:49,160
All I know is that people hate him and the people who hate him are usually people, fat

1417
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,280
old white men in suits.

1418
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,480
So I have a feeling that he's a man of the people and the same people that hate Bernie.

1419
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Yeah.

1420
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,480
Yeah.

1421
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
It feels like that.

1422
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,480
It feels like that.

1423
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,480
But I need to read the manifesto.

1424
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,280
And if I don't like it, I'm thinking I'll read the Lib Dem manifesto.

1425
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:10,160
And if I don't like that, I don't know what I'm going to do because either the Tory party...

1426
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Are you not going to read Boris's manifesto?

1427
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,160
Do they already have one or something?

1428
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,320
In like a list, they will have one.

1429
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,160
Like in the next few weeks, they're all going to have those.

1430
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
I don't know how this works.

1431
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Like policy and all that.

1432
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
Like I'm going to read the Labour one.

1433
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,360
If I don't like it and I don't want to vote Labour, then I'm going to look into Lib Dem

1434
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
and maybe vote Lib Dem.

1435
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,160
If I don't like that, I might look at the Tory one.

1436
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:36,840
And if I don't like all those, I guess I might just vote Brexit party because as much as

1437
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:45,360
Nigel Farage is like a crazy evil man, probably a big racist, he is one of the only politicians

1438
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,560
that is really like clear about his intentions.

1439
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,560
And I was like...

1440
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,560
Okay, but are they bad?

1441
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
They sound bad.

1442
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
Well, they're like a single party, right?

1443
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,560
I mean, I really don't expect the Brexit party manifesto to be appealing to me.

1444
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,560
It should be one fucking word, right?

1445
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Brexit.

1446
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,560
Well, no, they got to have all like policies on schools and health and all that sort of

1447
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,560
stuff.

1448
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:14,160
But like in terms of Brexit being a good thing or a bad thing, I've heard so many conflicting

1449
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,920
reports on whether it will be a good thing for the country or a bad thing for the country

1450
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,280
from all types of people that I don't actually know whether I want it or I don't want it.

1451
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,600
So voting Labour is like, there's going to be a referendum that they're going to do.

1452
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:32,360
So the people will vote and I will just, I'll see then what I want to vote for.

1453
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,520
Wait, what's the referendum for?

1454
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
The referendum will be after the election.

1455
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,800
Labour government say, if we win, we're going to have a referendum to put the Brexit to

1456
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:48,120
the people after they've gotten a better deal than the one Boris Johnson has with the European

1457
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Union for leaving.

1458
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,320
Do we already have a referendum on that?

1459
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,160
It's not like the whole point Brexit's supposed to be happening.

1460
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
I know.

1461
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,880
There's been a lot of talk about like the people generally have changed their opinion and is

1462
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:05,600
it right to go back and do it again without actually doing it in the first place and people

1463
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,600
were misinformed before, people are going to be misinformed again.

1464
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,400
It's like, it's a whole big fucking mess.

1465
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,760
I think at this point, a referendum would be all right.

1466
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:24,680
I don't think it would be a terrible abandonment of democracy because maybe the referendum

1467
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:29,200
will show that people still want to leave and then it'll be like, okay, well, we're

1468
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
leaving.

1469
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,480
That's tricky business.

1470
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,080
Did you guys hear about, Bernie tweeted about this.

1471
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:43,640
The former president of Brazil was in jail and everyone says, everyone that I've talked

1472
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:49,400
to says that he was like, they trumped up some corruption charges to get this guy in

1473
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,360
jail, to get him out of the office so that they could elect their guy, Bolsonaro.

1474
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:00,880
And Bolsonaro is like a far right fucking monster, apparently.

1475
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,960
And I guess Lula, just the Supreme Court, just were like, yeah, we're actually going

1476
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
to fix that.

1477
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,840
So they got Lula out of jail.

1478
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,120
Sorry, the Supreme Court of Brazil, I guess.

1479
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,120
No, of America.

1480
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,120
I don't know.

1481
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,120
I was checking.

1482
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,640
And Bernie tweeted about like, he's like, fuck yeah, Lula, you're my guy.

1483
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,680
And Lula was like, Bernie, you're my guy too.

1484
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:25,440
And I'm like, fuck yeah, dude, this fucking epic, I don't know.

1485
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,000
I don't really know much about it other than that.

1486
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,680
I just saw that Bernie was happy and I was happy too.

1487
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
I see Bernie smile.

1488
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,680
I hope it works out for everybody.

1489
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Yeah.

1490
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,040
Hey, to your point though, Gib, at the very beginning of this, that worrying about the

1491
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:48,160
meaning of life specifically is less cool and good to do generally than doing the work

1492
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,040
and being a good boy and doing things.

1493
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,280
Reminds me of the legendary Bestie Boy video, existentialism is a dangerous thing in which

1494
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,520
I geniusly clipped Casey Neistat saying that existentialism is a dangerous thing.

1495
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,120
Forget about it, get back to work.

1496
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,120
So true.

1497
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,560
Great clip boys.

1498
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,320
Real editing shots, clip that on Twitch.

1499
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,320
Clip that everybody.

1500
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,800
Okay, that's all I have to say about that.

1501
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,320
All right, let's get to these dang old voicemails over here.

1502
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,320
Yes.

1503
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,320
Let me see here.

1504
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,720
Okay, as I said before, speak pipe, blah, blah, blah, you know the drill.

1505
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:26,120
Okay, first one is of course from Hero of the People, racist Elmo calling back in.

1506
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,520
Let's see what he has for us this time.

1507
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,520
Go.

1508
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,520
I'm gonna say it.

1509
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,520
No, no, don't do it, Elmo.

1510
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,720
I'm gonna say it.

1511
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
No, Elmo.

1512
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
I swear to God, please don't.

1513
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
Please don't do it.

1514
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,720
I don't know anything about it.

1515
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,720
I'm gonna say it.

1516
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,720
I'm gonna say the bad word.

1517
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,720
Okay, Burmer.

1518
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,720
Yeah.

1519
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
That's it.

1520
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Yas, clean.

1521
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:53,120
How could anyone find that offensive?

1522
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,120
Have you guys heard about this?

1523
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
Yes.

1524
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
Burmer being a new slayer.

1525
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Yes, it's disgusting.

1526
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
A new N-word for old people.

1527
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
What?

1528
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,120
What?

1529
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,120
It's not acceptable.

1530
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,120
It's like old people have heard about it and are now actually angry.

1531
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Some people are pushing for it to be considered hate speech, to call someone Burmer.

1532
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,220
Did you guys see that New Zealand member of Congress who's like 25 or whatever, and while

1533
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,420
she's giving a speech about how fucking what assholes all the Boomers are, like the real

1534
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,040
Boomers, like someone's like heckling and she just goes, okay, Burmer, and then just

1535
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,720
keeps going with her speech in fucking Parliament or whatever.

1536
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,520
I didn't see it, but I heard about it pretty fine.

1537
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
It was New Zealand Parliament.

1538
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,320
New Zealand Parliament, you know, one of those funny states, one of those funny places.

1539
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,760
It is really funny that they exist over there.

1540
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,760
Absolutely true.

1541
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,040
What do you think, Ben?

1542
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,040
You're a Boomer.

1543
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,040
You're old.

1544
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,040
You're dead.

1545
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,040
You know.

1546
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,040
What do you think?

1547
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,040
Well, I mean, obviously we shouldn't ban okay, Boomer, because Boomers are bad and we

1548
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,120
should mock them all the time.

1549
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,120
Right, of course.

1550
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,920
Don't you find it a tad hypocritical that after surviving a decade of having millennial

1551
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,920
be used as a backhanded term, as soon as it comes back to bite them in the ash look,

1552
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,920
that's the new end word you can't say.

1553
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,920
You can't call me that.

1554
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,920
Obviously ridiculous.

1555
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
You can't say mean.

1556
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
You can't use that word.

1557
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
That's our way.

1558
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:18,920
I'm really curious who is pushing for this to be considered hate speech, because I think

1559
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,920
people on Facebook are starting petitions or something like that.

1560
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Which obviously means nothing, but yeah.

1561
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,920
Boomers do not even understand social politics.

1562
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Boomers are all over Facebook.

1563
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,920
No, that's what I mean.

1564
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,920
They wouldn't even understand that you could get something classified as hate speech.

1565
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,920
Would they?

1566
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,920
I'm not sure.

1567
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,920
Probably at this point.

1568
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Yeah, I would think so.

1569
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,920
I mean, my parents are Boomers.

1570
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,920
Certainly they would understand the concept of, well, it's different between making a word

1571
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
hate speech.

1572
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,920
That's a political thing they'd probably understand, versus specifically banning it on Facebook.

1573
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,920
That they might, I don't know.

1574
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,920
I feel like this is such a strange, stupid idea, because boomer is...

1575
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,920
Maybe they're probably just being blown out of proportion as an issue.

1576
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,920
There's so many other words you could use.

1577
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,920
They can't fucking hate speech all of them.

1578
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Okay, old man.

1579
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
Okay, pensioner.

1580
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,920
You can't hate speech all of us.

1581
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,920
That's a challenge, sir.

1582
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,920
Okay, creaky bones.

1583
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,920
You could say all sorts of things.

1584
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Well, but this is the leg they're standing on, and it's caught on as a pinnacle of this

1585
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,920
ageist side.

1586
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,920
Okay, skeleton.

1587
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
This oldist.

1588
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,920
That one hurts, my creaky old bones.

1589
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,920
Yeah, they just...

1590
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
I mean, whatever.

1591
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,920
It's obviously fucking retarded and ridiculous, but...

1592
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
Dude, hate speech.

1593
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,920
I mean, I don't like when people's ideas are dismissed based on their immutable characteristics,

1594
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
such as age.

1595
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Well, but nobody says okay, boomer, to someone just because they're old.

1596
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,920
They say it to them because they're acting like a boomer, and they're being stupid.

1597
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:58,920
They're being stubborn and old-fashioned for no reason other than to be stubborn.

1598
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,920
Don't you think that an accusation could be made is, let's say, of me in this group for

1599
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,920
like, I like to plan things, I like to nitpick, and I'm like, I need details.

1600
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,920
Is that me being a boomer?

1601
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Am I going to be okay boomered by...

1602
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
Am I going to be Judas by one of this group?

1603
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:12,920
You might be.

1604
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,920
What's your point?

1605
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,920
My point is...

1606
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
You're not a boomer.

1607
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,920
That's rude.

1608
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,920
And I will destroy people who say things I don't like.

1609
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,920
I am in the Teen CP fan group, and I am labeled cruelly a confirmed boomer.

1610
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Dude, you just got mocked day in, day out by those people who are not fair.

1611
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
Just own the word.

1612
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
Own the word.

1613
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,920
Just say, yeah, I'm a boomer.

1614
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
What of it?

1615
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
Yeah.

1616
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,920
Some day, Nate, we will be the boomers, and then we'll show these kids how it's done for

1617
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,920
you.

1618
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,920
We're millennials.

1619
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,920
We'll be the boomers when we were dropping the fucking bombs on their communes, these

1620
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
fucking zoomers.

1621
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,920
We're already called boomers by the zoomers.

1622
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,920
I mean, boomer is just a funny word anyway.

1623
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,920
I wouldn't mind being called a boomer.

1624
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,920
It's funny.

1625
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
We're millennials though.

1626
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,920
I know, but...

1627
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,920
The words just change.

1628
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,920
It's simply changed now.

1629
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,920
It's bullshit because it's...

1630
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,920
I don't like it because boomer is actually a bad thing.

1631
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,920
But it referred to a specific group of people who are bad and should be oppressed with hateful

1632
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,920
speech.

1633
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,720
But it sucks that people joke that the fact that it's expanded just mean anyone.

1634
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,960
The fact that I don't think it applies...

1635
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,920
It's not that I'm thinking, oh, you shouldn't be able to say it to me.

1636
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,560
I just really don't think it applies to me, but people use it for people like me.

1637
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,080
So Ben, if I'm one of the good ones, then I'm not a boomer.

1638
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,640
It's about a state of mind as opposed to a demograph.

1639
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,800
You wouldn't say okay boomer to someone who's not acting in that shitty boomer way.

1640
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,800
But I've seen so many people just call to boomer simply for being old and for no other

1641
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,800
reason.

1642
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
No, you're lying.

1643
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,800
Okay, but listen.

1644
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,320
There's people who get dismissed for having an anime icon on their Twitter.

1645
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,840
It doesn't matter what.

1646
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,000
You ban boomer, something else will crop up.

1647
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,160
People will dismiss other people based on very superficial things.

1648
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,160
It's stupid.

1649
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,160
We'll share.

1650
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,160
We can all agree on that.

1651
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,160
The thing with boomer...

1652
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,000
But I'm saying it's not superficial.

1653
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,160
People don't say okay boomer for superficial reasons.

1654
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,800
You say it when you're acting shitty.

1655
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,800
When someone...

1656
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,680
Anyone ever says it for superficial reasons.

1657
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,680
It's great.

1658
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,680
Believe them acting shitty.

1659
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,400
They're disagreeing with whatever the other person is believing, so they're dismissing

1660
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,320
them and their points by saying no.

1661
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,240
Okay, but disagreeing with your ideas is not superficial.

1662
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,920
It's not just because they're old.

1663
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,920
That's what I'm saying.

1664
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,200
It's not like the N-word, which is just something you can say to someone because they're black

1665
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,080
and it is bad for that reason.

1666
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,080
You don't use boomer in the same way.

1667
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,520
Wait, I can say it because they're black?

1668
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,080
Okay, I've got license to say that.

1669
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,640
I'm loading my barrels, boys.

1670
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,640
Here we go.

1671
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,640
It's not like that at all.

1672
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,640
That's my...

1673
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,640
Okay, there you go.

1674
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,640
It's definitely different.

1675
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,640
Yeah.

1676
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,920
All I'm going to say is, if someone ever calls me a boomer simply for being old in them,

1677
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,280
I will say, my big brother said you're not allowed to say that to me.

1678
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,280
That's really fucked up.

1679
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,280
What are you talking about?

1680
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,800
That's not what I said.

1681
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
No?

1682
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,600
Isn't that the point that it's about...

1683
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,600
No, you got everything wrong.

1684
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
...the things you're saying?

1685
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Okay, what?

1686
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,400
The point is that it's not just about age.

1687
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,880
Aren't we agreeing on that?

1688
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
Yeah, I'm saying, yeah, you can say it.

1689
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,880
Yeah, you can say it.

1690
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Okay.

1691
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,880
You can say it.

1692
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,840
The point is that you don't just say it because someone's old.

1693
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,280
Nobody fucking does that.

1694
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,680
I was literally called a boomer in the Teen CP fan chat because I'm older than them because

1695
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,680
I'm like 29.

1696
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,680
But they didn't mean it.

1697
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
That's it.

1698
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,680
But they didn't mean it.

1699
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,680
Oh, okay.

1700
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,680
Oh, my man.

1701
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,680
They didn't mean it.

1702
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,680
They didn't mean it.

1703
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,680
They didn't mean it.

1704
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,680
They didn't mean what okay boomer means.

1705
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,680
That's the problem.

1706
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:41,000
They'll learn the word from meme sites and they won't know what the context is fully.

1707
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,960
As the word gets circulated more and more, people will misunderstand its usage more and

1708
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,160
more until it doesn't actually work as what it was initially intended to be.

1709
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Yep.

1710
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,160
Oh, boy.

1711
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Nothing means anything.

1712
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,840
It's just gonna be a phrase of dismissal of someone's point.

1713
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
Well, sometimes it is.

1714
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
No matter the reason.

1715
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
Sometimes.

1716
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
That's what it's gonna become.

1717
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
Do we agree?

1718
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
Yeah.

1719
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,840
Do we agree?

1720
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,840
Okay.

1721
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Okay.

1722
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Anyway.

1723
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Got another voicemail here.

1724
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,840
Let's go.

1725
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:09,840
Oh, shit.

1726
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,840
All right.

1727
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Here we go.

1728
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,880
This is how tanky is Ben.

1729
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,880
Let's hear what he has to say.

1730
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,880
All right.

1731
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,880
Here we go.

1732
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,380
Nate only likes musical mail.

1733
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,600
So here's a voicemail as a song.

1734
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:30,480
What are all of your hot takes on revolution in Hong Kong?

1735
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,480
That's it.

1736
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,720
Cool message.

1737
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,720
See, short and sweet.

1738
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,720
This is fun.

1739
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,720
Good.

1740
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,720
I've heard.

1741
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,720
I've got no hot take.

1742
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,920
I saw this fucking YouTube channel called Nathan Rich, who is this American expat living

1743
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:51,040
in China, who sort of debunked a lot of the claims made by the Hong Kong protestors.

1744
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,280
I can't remember exactly what it was about, but it was interesting that they're bound

1745
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,000
to exaggerate as every side will.

1746
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That is like...

1747
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Nathan Rich.

1748
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yeah.

1749
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,360
I mean, he looks like an evil man, like a skinhead.

1750
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,760
Oh, I don't like the look of this guy at all.

1751
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,680
But there was a video that was like...

1752
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,240
He was just looking at policy and like the reason for the thing in the...

1753
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,240
I don't know.

1754
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,600
I remember it being compelling.

1755
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,360
It was a while since I actually looked at it.

1756
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:24,440
But worth checking out just to see what argument there is against the protests.

1757
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,200
Everybody's diesel position is going to be...

1758
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:32,800
I've heard nothing of this position from anywhere because no, I don't follow Chinese

1759
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
media at all.

1760
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,480
So like, I don't know what they would think.

1761
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,840
Look, even if Hong Kong turns out to be 100% right, everything China is doing is fucked

1762
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
up.

1763
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
Like, okay, that's fine.

1764
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,440
But I have actually never heard China's argument.

1765
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,040
I've only heard the Hong Kong argument and I'm just saying, I'm just, I'm a little bit

1766
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,040
agnostic.

1767
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,360
Seems to me probably this seems wrong, but you should definitely hear at least the argument

1768
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,360
if it's just, no, we own you.

1769
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
That's it.

1770
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
We're going to do whatever we want.

1771
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
Then I'm like, oh, okay.

1772
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
Then I mean, that seems a little unfair.

1773
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,120
Well, if they haven't said anything other than that, then I guess that's all they got.

1774
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,520
I have paid no attention.

1775
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,520
Well, maybe Nathan Richier will open my eyes to why China is a benevolent dictator.

1776
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:15,360
The initial thing Hong Kong was built for was like a UK base of operations in case the

1777
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,200
UK wanted to invade China.

1778
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,200
They took the land from China.

1779
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,440
They built it up and it became its own thing.

1780
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:28,480
Then they had like, you know, you can't really have this said China and UK was like, yeah,

1781
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,600
colonialism was kind of bad.

1782
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,240
We're going to stop doing all that stuff.

1783
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,040
So we're going to give it back to you.

1784
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,440
Here's a contract for how this is going to happen.

1785
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:42,320
And then the year came when that happened and it happened and it was just sort of like,

1786
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:47,400
it's supposed to be to come back to China from what I understand.

1787
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,040
So it's not like Britain is like, no, this actually still is ours.

1788
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,520
It's that Hong Kong itself wants to be independent, which is fair enough.

1789
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,200
But, you know, like I can definitely see that there is a lot of case on the Hong Kong side.

1790
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:06,560
I'm not just suddenly saying, I saw this YouTuber and I'm like a big evil man now and I fully

1791
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,840
support China.

1792
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,840
Not true.

1793
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,160
I just was interested to see that.

1794
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:18,920
I mean, it's quite handy to have like a Chinese, like an English speaking man saying the Chinese

1795
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,920
point of view.

1796
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,520
That's otherwise I would never, I would never know.

1797
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,760
Apparently, we all agree, fuck Hong Kong, which we're, you know, take it over China.

1798
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,000
Apparently, one of the things that the protesters want is universal suffrage, which I guess

1799
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,480
they don't have.

1800
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,840
Oh, it's because like, I think if they were absorbed into China, I think that they would

1801
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,880
lose the current like democratic system that they have.

1802
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,800
And obviously they're kind of into that.

1803
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,320
They want to maintain that.

1804
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,600
It's hard to argue against that.

1805
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,520
That seems like a pretty reasonable, you know.

1806
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:54,800
I think the thing Nathan said was like in the contract, there was no guarantee of universal

1807
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,920
suffrage to be given.

1808
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,240
So like in any case, like it seems like the UK was just like, yeah, just fucking deal

1809
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,240
with it.

1810
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,240
And they left.

1811
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,160
And Hong Kong was just like, they didn't like that.

1812
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:12,240
They wanted more out of this deal and they're kind of getting fucked over.

1813
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,640
It seems like China is scary.

1814
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,640
China is scary.

1815
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:24,120
It seems like China wants to do its like fucking like silencing of dissidents and journalists

1816
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120
and activists.

1817
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,120
It sure does.

1818
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,240
It wants to do that in Hong Kong.

1819
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,240
And this is like part of what started the whole thing.

1820
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:35,960
I mean, I linked a video, you know, maybe if we link like whatever, this guy, Nathan

1821
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,960
Rich's video.

1822
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,960
Okay, great.

1823
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,080
I saw another video that was like way on the other side about like China.

1824
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,040
Like I, when people say China is bad, I'm like, I believe that sounds reasonable.

1825
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,920
I actually know like nothing about how China operates, but I watched one video fairly recently

1826
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,760
and I was like, ooh, that's not so good, China, you really fucking over these boys.

1827
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,760
That's not cool.

1828
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,760
That's not cool.

1829
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,760
Like if it comes down to it.

1830
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,760
I forgot the specific link of video.

1831
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
That's the word on the street.

1832
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,760
That's the word on the street.

1833
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
That's all we need to know.

1834
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,760
Yeah.

1835
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,240
I mean, when it comes down to it, I like underdogs.

1836
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,720
So I'm generally in Hong Kong.

1837
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,720
Oh my God.

1838
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:14,240
Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China

1839
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,760
would end in, quote, bodies smashed and bones ground into powder.

1840
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,760
Yeah.

1841
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,920
That is a quote from the President of China.

1842
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,920
Maybe a red flag or two.

1843
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,920
I don't know.

1844
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,920
I don't know.

1845
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:32,480
I don't want to jump to conclusions here, you know, it seems, there could be some explanation

1846
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,480
here.

1847
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,480
Oh yeah.

1848
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Was it bones ground to powder?

1849
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,480
Jesus Christ.

1850
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,480
Body smashed and bone.

1851
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,480
Well, I don't want that.

1852
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,360
So I guess I shouldn't support separatism.

1853
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,000
You know, I like the cut of that man's jib.

1854
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,440
Imagine a Winnie the Pooh smashing your body to pieces and grinding your bones to powder.

1855
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,440
Isn't it funny?

1856
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,440
To make these delicious honey pots.

1857
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,640
Isn't it funny that Winnie the Pooh and the Chinese flag are the same colors?

1858
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,520
Oh, very interesting indeed, Tom.

1859
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
What a coincidence.

1860
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,520
Wait, which flags?

1861
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,000
The Chinese flag and Winnie the Pooh are the same color.

1862
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Same color scheme.

1863
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Hmm.

1864
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Well, I guess.

1865
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,840
Did you ever see Winnie the Pooh's label?

1866
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,000
Maybe it was made in China.

1867
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Oh.

1868
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Makes sense to me.

1869
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Okay.

1870
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,600
I think I'm pro Hong Kong on this one.

1871
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,360
I think I'm coming down on that side.

1872
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,520
This guy, he asked for hot takes, so you've got two hot takes.

1873
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,400
One, go Hong Kong and the second hot take.

1874
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Go China.

1875
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,400
Fuck yeah.

1876
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,400
Do it up, boys.

1877
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,920
My hot take is see the two sides of the story at least.

1878
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,920
That's my hot take.

1879
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,920
We can please everyone.

1880
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,920
We must.

1881
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,320
They said it couldn't be done.

1882
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,400
And they said bipartisanship was a myth.

1883
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,400
All right.

1884
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:45,000
Let's go on to the ghost of scumbag, Chris, is calling back once again.

1885
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Let's hear what he has to say.

1886
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Oh, wait, wait.

1887
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,880
Last time he called him, he was just scumbag, Chris.

1888
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,800
Now he's the ghost of scumbag, Chris.

1889
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,960
I guess he killed himself.

1890
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,440
Yes, he did.

1891
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,960
Maybe he was in China a little bit too long.

1892
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,840
Maybe he had his bones ground to powder.

1893
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,840
We can only hope.

1894
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,960
Maybe he killed himself like Epstein did.

1895
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,960
Of course.

1896
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,160
It all makes sense.

1897
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,760
Now there's a story I can believe.

1898
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,760
All right.

1899
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,760
Let's play it.

1900
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,760
Go on, Chris.

1901
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,760
Take it away.

1902
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,760
Yes.

1903
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,760
You're a piece of shit.

1904
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,760
Oh, shit.

1905
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:19,760
I tried to make an emotionally poignant finale to the scumbag, Chris Trilogy.

1906
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,760
You failed.

1907
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:27,480
After you said to tell more of it, but my third voicemail was never played.

1908
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,480
Quality always matters.

1909
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:33,480
You were worthy in favor of some garbage about the dimensional murder.

1910
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Better start drinking from the cup, because this is the final straw.

1911
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
Oh, shit.

1912
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:49,480
Now my character arc has been cut unjustly short by your hand, and I wander the PC purgatory

1913
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,480
as a vengeful spirit of vengeance.

1914
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,480
Get your shit together.

1915
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,480
Start taking better voicemails.

1916
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:06,480
For next time you're on, get ready for a mouthful of ghosts.

1917
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,480
Scary.

1918
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:13,480
I guess a current example, not a good example of these better voicemails that you're helping

1919
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,480
us to play.

1920
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,480
Halloween's over.

1921
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,480
Ghost of scumbag, Chris.

1922
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,480
Get the fuck out of here.

1923
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,480
This window was closed on this opportunity.

1924
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,480
I like how I half-assed that voice was.

1925
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,480
I know.

1926
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,480
He didn't even put any stank on it, which I mean reverb.

1927
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,480
That would be the way to make it easy ghost.

1928
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,480
I think we've just seen an example of exactly why your character arc was cut tragically

1929
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,480
short.

1930
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,480
Scumbag, Chris.

1931
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,480
Can't even do a little reverb.

1932
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,480
That's not much to ask for, really.

1933
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,480
It didn't need reverb.

1934
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
I liked how shitty it was.

1935
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,480
Really?

1936
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Scumbag to the bitter end.

1937
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,480
Appreciate that, Chris.

1938
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
Better luck next time, chief.

1939
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,480
Okay, let's go.

1940
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,480
We've got next up a humble request.

1941
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Okay.

1942
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Ready?

1943
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
One, two, three, go.

1944
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,480
Hi, guys.

1945
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:03,480
Please consider uploading your shit to Spotify or updating your Google Drive more often,

1946
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:09,480
because when I want to listen to the new PCP, there are usually two websites they use to

1947
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:15,480
convert your video to an mp3, so I can listen to it on my phone, but sometimes it doesn't

1948
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,480
work on the website for some reason.

1949
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,480
So yeah, please do Spotify.

1950
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:25,480
Spotify would make my life a million, a gazillion times easier.

1951
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,480
I will pray.

1952
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,480
Can we make money through Spotify?

1953
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Good question.

1954
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:35,480
You can make money, but last I checked when I tried to get the podcast on Spotify, they

1955
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,480
were not accepting podcast submissions at the time.

1956
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,480
I don't know.

1957
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,480
Well, shit.

1958
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,480
Just call it an album.

1959
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:48,480
I do grind my face against the whetstone that is the internet every week to get the podcast

1960
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,480
up on iTunes, Google Play, and a bunch of other things.

1961
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,480
It's just not on Spotify because Spotify is its own thing, and it's not on Stitcher

1962
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,480
either.

1963
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,480
Maybe that will change for a nominal fee.

1964
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Would that cost money to get it on Stitcher or something?

1965
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,480
I don't know.

1966
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,480
I'd have to look into it.

1967
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,480
Okay, well, fair enough.

1968
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,480
Is the Google Drive not up to date?

1969
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,480
The drive is up to date.

1970
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,480
The problem is, once it hits a certain amount of downloads, it stops working, and that happens

1971
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,480
almost instantly.

1972
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,480
Wait, what?

1973
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,480
That's why I wanted to play.

1974
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,480
What?

1975
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,480
Yeah, that's right.

1976
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,480
I wanted to link for a limited amount of times, which is why I keep saying, or I mentioned,

1977
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:30,480
like last week, we should put the iTunes and Google podcast links in the description.

1978
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Which is exactly why I wanted to play this, because I think I did it for the last episode.

1979
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,480
Did I?

1980
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,480
Remember to do that?

1981
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,480
I don't think you did.

1982
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,480
Oops.

1983
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,480
Well, okay.

1984
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,480
We can go back and fix that, and we'll put it in the future.

1985
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,480
We probably will stop linking the Google Drive one, especially because of this cap thing.

1986
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,480
Like, what's the point?

1987
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,480
It's not really very useful.

1988
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,480
That's the worst.

1989
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,480
Pretty good.

1990
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,480
It is bad.

1991
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,480
It is bad.

1992
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,980
But if we give you people the fucking iTunes link, and whatever the other one you said,

1993
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:54,980
I can't remember.

1994
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:58,480
If they're there, then I mean, that's the better option, just to use those podcast things.

1995
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,480
I don't know why we haven't been linking up to this point.

1996
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,480
So from now on, I think look for those.

1997
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,980
Those are better options overall.

1998
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,480
You have 4.7 out of 5 stars on iTunes.

1999
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,480
We're doing good.

2000
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,480
Not bad.

2001
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,480
Not bad.

2002
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,480
That's quality.

2003
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,480
That's quality.

2004
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,480
Guys, I have news.

2005
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,480
We sold a first loser of Fine Purpose November shirt.

2006
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,480
Yeah.

2007
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,480
He's the last loser.

2008
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,480
Yes.

2009
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,480
Show them out.

2010
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,480
There's one loser.

2011
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Who is it?

2012
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,480
I don't know who it was.

2013
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,480
I want to know so bad.

2014
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,480
Right into the show.

2015
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
Leave us a voicemail.

2016
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,480
Make it short because I won't play it.

2017
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Tweet yourself.

2018
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
Take a picture of yourself in the mirror.

2019
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,480
Please.

2020
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,480
We need that picture and tweet as soon as you can.

2021
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,480
I want to see it.

2022
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,480
Well, I mean, I'm sure it's in the mail right now, but...

2023
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,480
Well, okay.

2024
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
But as soon as you can, as soon as you can.

2025
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,480
We love those.

2026
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,480
We love to see the merch and the pictures and whatnot.

2027
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,480
Actually, it sold this morning.

2028
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,480
To day.

2029
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,480
Let me see.

2030
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,480
To day.

2031
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,480
The episode's been out like two or three days now, so, okay, that's not...

2032
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,480
I guess it's not that weird.

2033
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,480
That's not just right.

2034
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,480
Okay.

2035
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Yeah.

2036
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,480
Excellent.

2037
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,480
Anyway, just wanted to let you all know that the system works.

2038
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,480
It did.

2039
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,480
It does.

2040
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,480
And I just want to know so bad, who is the first loser of Fine Purpose November?

2041
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,480
Who could it be?

2042
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,480
And so far, the only one.

2043
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Who has found no purpose.

2044
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,480
He's got the title and the crown.

2045
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,480
I'm glad that everybody who is considering buying this shirt now will know it.

2046
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,480
For them, it is a lie that they are not the first loser anymore.

2047
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,480
That's true.

2048
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,480
No, no, no.

2049
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:20,480
To be fair, just because you bought the shirt, that doesn't mean that you, before this person,

2050
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,480
didn't, in your own way, lose Fine Purpose November first.

2051
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,480
At a minimum, you're going to need to buy the shirt to compete.

2052
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,480
Yeah, yeah, buy the shirt.

2053
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,480
So you really need to get on your game and buy the shirt already.

2054
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,480
You don't lose Fine Purpose November by buying the shirt.

2055
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,480
That's not what does it.

2056
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,480
It's already a thing about you.

2057
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,480
It's just a mark.

2058
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,480
Wait.

2059
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,480
It's like the mark of Cain.

2060
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,480
How do you fail?

2061
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,480
You have to not find a purpose in November.

2062
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,480
You have to be certain that you will not find purpose.

2063
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,480
I was the first loser.

2064
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:51,480
You must have disqualified yourself from possibly finding purpose.

2065
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,480
For the whole month.

2066
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,480
Yes.

2067
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,480
For the whole month.

2068
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,480
That's right.

2069
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Demonstrating.

2070
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,480
And that's up to you.

2071
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,480
I'd love to hear the story of how that was done.

2072
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,480
How did you lose Fine Purpose November?

2073
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,480
For good.

2074
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,480
Citizens.

2075
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,480
Good.

2076
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,480
Cool, cool.

2077
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,480
All right.

2078
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,480
Next voicemail, we've got, let me see.

2079
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,480
This is Lil' Bobo Spitten Facts Freestyle.

2080
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,480
Okay.

2081
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,480
Are you ready for this?

2082
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,480
Get ready for some straight facts from Lil' Bobo.

2083
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,480
Okay.

2084
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,480
Take it away.

2085
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,480
More gay facts, please.

2086
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,480
Yes.

2087
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,480
Obscended it himself.

2088
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,480
Good.

2089
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,480
All right.

2090
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,480
Nate is over in games.

2091
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,480
No.

2092
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,480
No.

2093
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:32,480
Mages of female.

2094
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,480
There it is.

2095
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,480
Gibb is probably a creep in your life.

2096
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,480
Ben is straight up writing fan fiction.

2097
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,480
No, come on.

2098
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,480
When you have bad taste in energy drinks.

2099
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
I don't like, end it.

2100
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,480
Cut it off.

2101
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,480
And I love it.

2102
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,480
There you go.

2103
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,480
All right.

2104
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,480
It's not fan fiction.

2105
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,480
It's a social experiment.

2106
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,480
It can be fan fiction if it's canonical.

2107
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,480
Yeah, which it all is.

2108
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,480
Yes, yes.

2109
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
And it's also a fact, everybody.

2110
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,480
That's right.

2111
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,480
It's not fan fiction.

2112
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,480
It's fan fact.

2113
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,480
Perfect.

2114
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
Put that on a fucking shirt.

2115
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,480
That's genius.

2116
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:21,480
What did he mean say, like, I'm probably a creep in real life?

2117
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,480
No, notice how he couched that in, probably.

2118
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,480
Those fucking wiggle words and shit.

2119
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,480
I thought you were spitting facts, man.

2120
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,480
Yeah, I mean, it's not a fact.

2121
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,480
But also, like, on what basis is this made?

2122
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,480
I don't know.

2123
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,480
Who can say, man?

2124
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,480
I don't like that.

2125
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,480
I don't like this guy spitting at me.

2126
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:43,480
That seems like a creepier thing to do than whatever you do.

2127
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,480
Ooh, damn, true.

2128
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,480
He's got to justify himself.

2129
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,480
Yeah.

2130
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,480
Defend your, debate us.

2131
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,480
Debate us on stream power.

2132
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,480
Call back in.

2133
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
I want more freestyle defending your claims here.

2134
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
Give us more hot free styles, dude.

2135
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,480
The burden of proof is on you.

2136
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,480
It's true.

2137
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,480
It's very true.

2138
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,480
Oh, those wiggle words.

2139
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,480
Wiggle words.

2140
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
Wiggle words.

2141
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,480
Wiggle words.

2142
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,480
No, no.

2143
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
The wiggle words do not discuss me at all.

2144
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,480
Please.

2145
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,480
All right.

2146
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
We've got one more voicemail.

2147
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,480
Now, this is Mozilla Fennekin on voicemails.

2148
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,480
He's got some information to deliver about voicemails.

2149
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:20,480
So, let's give him a minute and 12 seconds to sue Diaz to say.

2150
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,480
That's a lot.

2151
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,480
Okay.

2152
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,480
Take it away.

2153
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,480
Take it away.

2154
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,480
A piece of advice on how to get your voicemails played on the PCP from the actual god of voicemails.

2155
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,480
The god of bad voicemails, that is.

2156
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:40,480
If you have, like, a joke or a skit that you want to do, maybe just think about it for a day or two before actually submitting it.

2157
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:48,480
You know, the whole reason why I did the human core thing is because I thought my answer of bathrooms was funny for, like, 30 minutes.

2158
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:57,480
And so, when it came time for me to actually follow up on that, I didn't think it was funny, but I, you know, had to follow up on it.

2159
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,480
I was fucking trapped.

2160
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,480
So, I did it anyway.

2161
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:05,480
And now I'm trapped here in this prison to rot forever!

2162
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
Don't be like me.

2163
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,480
Be funny.

2164
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,480
Be creative.

2165
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,480
Do something interesting like this.

2166
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,480
Yes.

2167
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,480
Amazing.

2168
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,480
Oh, wow.

2169
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:24,480
I'm supposed to be saying the n-word now!

2170
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:32,480
You have been banned from the Mickey Mouse Club for inappropriate behavior.

2171
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,480
You know, I was about to say, don't listen to this guy.

2172
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,480
This is a bad email.

2173
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,480
Right.

2174
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,480
This is a bad voicemail, but he saved it.

2175
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,480
He saved it at the end.

2176
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,480
He saved it at the end.

2177
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:44,480
He saved it at the end.

2178
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,480
Good work.

2179
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,480
What's the Mickey Mouse clip from?

2180
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,480
I don't know, but I want to.

2181
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,480
Sounds like the voice of Mickey Mouse himself.

2182
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,480
That might have been him.

2183
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:57,480
Maybe he's been calling in all along, pretending to be Mozilla Fenniken, but really he's been

2184
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,480
Mickey Mouse.

2185
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:03,480
Mickey Mouse sounds more like, hey.

2186
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,480
Hey.

2187
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Hey.

2188
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,480
Hey, it's happy days.

2189
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,480
Happy days are yours.

2190
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,480
Okay.

2191
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,480
I'm going to get some of that Gabagool.

2192
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,480
Goofy.

2193
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,480
Hey.

2194
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,480
I'm eating.

2195
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:17,480
I'm walking my New York style pizza.

2196
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,480
Where's Mickey from?

2197
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,480
Is Mickey like from the deep south, you know?

2198
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,480
He's from the south.

2199
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,480
He's a rat.

2200
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,440
He's a fucking rat.

2201
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,520
Oh, dude.

2202
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,000
Oh, fun, totally unrelated story.

2203
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,160
I had close encounter with some rats yesterday.

2204
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,000
Oh yeah?

2205
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,840
Yeah.

2206
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,160
You know, I did too at a taco stand.

2207
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,920
We just saw a big delicious looking rat

2208
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,280
run under the taco stand.

2209
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,120
Delicious looking.

2210
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:38,960
They were delicious looking.

2211
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,800
Ooh, it was great.

2212
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,640
Yeah, go on, what do you got?

2213
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,400
I saw, I was out, we went to,

2214
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,200
I was with Munchie, Kazi,

2215
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,240
and Kibun and Fat Yoshi from RFCK.

2216
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,560
And we went out to a Boba Tea place

2217
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,720
and I was standing outside

2218
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,920
and I looked at the trash can

2219
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,760
and these two rats,

2220
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,680
one rat just crawled up the trash can

2221
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,720
and I realized there was a second rat already there

2222
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,320
and the two of them just like hung their heads

2223
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,160
over the lip of it,

2224
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,040
looking into the trash can

2225
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,800
and then someone walked by and they scattered.

2226
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,640
And then I was like, hey guys, check it out.

2227
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,440
I saw some rats in this trash can

2228
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,840
and they all went up to the trash can

2229
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,560
and then like more rats like exploded out of it

2230
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,960
and they all like fled.

2231
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,920
They all like started running

2232
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,200
and screaming down the street.

2233
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,520
And I was like, what are you guys so worried about?

2234
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,360
It's just rats.

2235
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,120
They're just mice but big.

2236
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,000
These are my people.

2237
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,920
Do not be afraid.

2238
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,360
Embrace them as you do me.

2239
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,200
They were fine, they were cute.

2240
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,040
I liked them.

2241
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:24,880
Rats are cute.

2242
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,720
I love rats.

2243
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,560
Yeah, they were okay.

2244
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,480
Yeah, the rat bit the taco stand was pretty cute.

2245
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,320
He was a good boy.

2246
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,160
Rats are smart and cute and I love them.

2247
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,960
I've seen the rats of Nim.

2248
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,440
They're as smart as human beings, as I understand it,

2249
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,720
if not smarter.

2250
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,560
It's crowd-pleasing.

2251
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,920
Because they know there's free food in those trash cans.

2252
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,800
They're not wasting time earning it to buy it.

2253
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,400
They live off the teat

2254
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,040
as any wise individual would do.

2255
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,440
Yeah, I agree.

2256
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,280
I'm with it.

2257
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,120
There you go.

2258
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:49,960
Oh, there might be.

2259
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:50,800
No, no, no, wait.

2260
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,640
Hold on.

2261
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,480
Rat idea.

2262
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,800
I just remembered.

2263
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,520
Rat idea, yeah.

2264
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,360
Okay.

2265
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,640
I've seen a rat recently, too.

2266
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,680
Well, not too recently,

2267
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,520
but the last time I was in Burger King,

2268
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,040
I think that was like a while ago.

2269
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,600
Oh, no.

2270
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,800
We were just eating burgers, me and Byter,

2271
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,760
and I looked out the window

2272
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,320
and we saw a little rat scurry away

2273
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,480
with a little packet of ketchup in its mouth.

2274
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,160
Aw, that's cute.

2275
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,920
A feast for a king.

2276
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,640
That's pretty cute.

2277
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,560
You know, this whole equal distribution

2278
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,560
of resources thing,

2279
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,720
like I can get aboard with it to the human student degree,

2280
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:25,680
but what about the animals?

2281
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,720
We gotta distribute our resources to the rats

2282
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,240
and the pigs and the cows and the chickens.

2283
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,760
No, we have to exclude someone, and I think they're it.

2284
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,800
We all know that human nature requires an underclass

2285
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,960
to step on it and make it feel worse than us.

2286
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,960
A certain baseline level of bigotry,

2287
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,200
and I think we found our marks, ladies and gentlemen.

2288
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,240
I think we've done it, blue girls.

2289
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,080
Mouses.

2290
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,640
Hashtag animal racism, we're doing it.

2291
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,480
Yes.

2292
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,760
All right, thanks for being here.

2293
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,240
Hey, thanks for all the voicemails, everybody.

2294
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,320
Appreciate those, those are good.

2295
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,760
Leave more at the Speakpike link in the description,

2296
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,880
and give us money for all the hard work we do here

2297
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,960
on the show at patreon.com slash PCP.

2298
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,200
Wait, the procrastiners, yeah, you know the one.

2299
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,520
Link below.

2300
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,920
Yeah, what's up?

2301
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,920
Mouse, mice, rat, rice, really makes you think.

2302
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,200
Really makes you think.

2303
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,680
Chinese, really gets the old ticker tickin' away,

2304
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,440
if you know what I'm sayin'.

2305
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,800
Twitter.com slash P, what is it?

2306
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,920
The procrastinators, I'm fuckin' it all up today.

2307
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,640
Yeah, yeah, you know, we do things there,

2308
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,560
updates and whatnot, follow us there, information, et cetera.

2309
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,480
And anything else, buy t-shirts.

2310
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,120
Find no purpose in November,

2311
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,880
and prove it by buying a fat ass t-shirt

2312
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,080
for your fat ass body.

2313
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,000
I recommend the whole neck.

2314
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,280
There you go, there you go.

2315
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,320
And I guess that's all there is to say about that.

2316
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,720
Let's keep it short, you know, why drag it out

2317
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,920
like the Jepstein murder investigation?

2318
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,680
No, no, no, just call it quits right here, folks.

2319
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,160
Let's just wrap this thing up and send it down the Y.

2320
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,200
Why drag it out like a fucking protest?

2321
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,360
Like, for fuck's sake, what happened to protocol?

2322
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,160
For Hong Kong, just submit, just submit already.

2323
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,080
Like quit makin' a ruckus, okay?

2324
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,520
Yeah, yeah, we got trades to make,

2325
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,040
we got Bitcoin to invest in,

2326
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,160
I don't have time for this human capital stuff

2327
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,000
to worry about.

2328
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,840
Hell yeah.

2329
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,720
The capital I care about is Cincinnati?

2330
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,040
The capital of Ohio where I live?

2331
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:17,880
Yeah, there you go.

2332
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,440
Why riot, why riot, why riot for suffrage

2333
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,080
when you can just vote to get it?

2334
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,200
Oh, wait, whoops.

2335
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,040
That's what I thought.

2336
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,960
All right, we'll see you next week, everybody.

2337
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,560
Have a good week.

2338
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,400
Bye.

2339
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,240
Peace out, bye.

2340
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,760
Nerd, bye-bye.
